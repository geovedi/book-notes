# Animal Farm

George Orwell (1945)

In George Orwell's "Animal Farm," the animals of Manor Farm are inspired by Old Major's call for revolution against human tyranny. They successfully overthrow Mr Jones, establish Animal Farm, and strive for a better future.

Snowball and Napoleon emerge as influential leaders, teaching Animalism and guiding the animals. They face challenges such as food shortages and the construction of a windmill. Power dynamics shift and the pigs grow more authoritarian.

The animals endure hardships, battles, and betrayals. They mourn the loss of comrades like Boxer, witness the pigs' transformation into human-like figures, and confront their shattered dreams. Nevertheless, they vow to reclaim their farm and fight for equality and freedom.

Throughout their journey, the animals hold onto hope and their unwavering belief in a better world, striving to preserve the spirit of justice against the pigs' betrayal.

## Chapter 1

On a Manor Farm farm, the animals are roused from their slumber by the accidental opening of the hen houses. Inspired by the wise pig Old Major, who spoke of a future free from human tyranny, they gather in the barn. Old Major exposes the oppressive nature of their existence under Mr Jones and ignites a rebellion.

The animals eagerly embrace the call for revolution, uniting in their desire for freedom. They even extend their solidarity to include the rats. Old Major leads them in singing "Beasts of England," a powerful anthem that fuels their determination for a brighter future.

Their moment of unity is abruptly shattered by the sound of Mr Jones' gun. Fear grips the animals, and they scatter in search of safety. Returning to their sleeping places, their hearts still race with the excitement of their shared vision. They drift off to sleep, their dreams filled with hope and the anticipation of a life liberated from human dominance. Little do they know that their journey toward that dream is about to begin, forever altering the course of Manor Farm.

## Chapter 2

After Old Major's inspiring speech, he peacefully passes away, leaving his teachings in the hearts of the animals. They hold a solemn burial for him, and secret gatherings occur in the barn to discuss his ideas and plan for rebellion. Snowball and Napoleon emerge as influential leaders, guiding the animals towards a brighter future.

United by their shared vision, the pigs teach Animalism to their fellow creatures, though some struggle to understand or remain sceptical. Boxer and Clover become dedicated disciples. Meanwhile, the sly raven Moses spreads doubt with tales of Sugarcandy Mountain, challenging Animalism's principles.

Conditions under Jones worsen, and the hungry animals reach a breaking point. They launch a fierce rebellion, driving Jones and his men off the farm. Animal Farm is born, and the animals celebrate their freedom, erasing all remnants of Jones' reign. The Seven Commandments of Animalism are established, guiding their society.

Snowball paints the Commandments on the barn, and the animals begin their first harvest, following the lead of Snowball and Napoleon. Power dynamics start to shift as Napoleon takes control of the cows' milk. Nevertheless, the animals persevere, leaving the milk behind as they strive to build a better future on Animal Farm.
 
## Chapter 3

Guided by the pigs, the animals worked tirelessly in the fields, led by Boxer and Clover. Overcoming challenges, they showed ingenuity and dedication. The pigs assumed leadership roles, utilising their intelligence.

As the harvest approached, satisfaction and unity grew among the animals. Mollie and the cat displayed less commitment. Benjamin remained cynical, reminding them of reality.

Sundays became rest days with meetings for collective decision-making. Snowball led committees and classes, fostering education. Literacy empowered the animals, giving them a voice.

Boxer supervised the dogs, upholding the Seven Commandments. Napoleon focused on educating the young with a group of puppies.

The mystery of the disappearing milk was revealed. The pigs claimed it was for their well-being and efficient management. The animals reluctantly accepted their elevated status, fearing the return of Jones. They believed their sacrifice was necessary for their independence.

## Chapter 4

News of the Rebellion at Animal Farm quickly spread, carried by pigeons to neighbouring farms. Foxwood and Pinchfield, initially dismissive, grew intrigued. Rumours of cannibalism circulated, inspiring small rebellions.

In October, Mr Jones and men from other farms attempted to recapture Animal Farm. Snowball's strategic defence plan and Boxer's strength led to a fierce battle. The animals emerged victorious, driving the men into retreat.

Mollie hid during the chaos, while Snowball and Boxer were hailed as heroes. The Battle of the Cowshed became a symbol of resilience. The animals held a funeral for the fallen sheep and displayed Mr Jones's gun to commemorate their freedom.

## Chapter 5

Mollie, the troubled white mare, faced accusations of consorting with humans. Confronted by Clover, she denied the claims but fled, leaving behind evidence of her betrayal. Mollie remained missing, rumoured to be enjoying human attention.

Winter brought freezing temperatures, making work difficult. Snowball and Napoleon clashed over building a windmill. Napoleon drove Snowball away and took control. The pigs became the sole decision-makers, and the animals accepted the change.

Napoleon announced the windmill's construction, claiming it was his idea. Squealer justified the sudden shift. The animals, trusting Napoleon, embraced the task, unaware of hidden motives.

Under Napoleon's rule, work on the windmill began, shaping the farm's future in unexpected ways.

## Chapter 6

Under Napoleon's leadership, the animals of Animal Farm faced new challenges. Working hours expanded, and rations were reduced. The harvest suffered, and building the windmill proved difficult.

The animals devised a gravity-based method to break stones for construction, with Boxer leading the effort. Shortages of oil, nails, and seeds arose, leading Napoleon to trade with neighbouring farms.

The pigs took up residence in the farmhouse, justifying it as necessary. Squealer manipulated the animals' memories, easing their concerns. The animals worked diligently on the windmill despite harsh weather.

A storm destroyed the windmill, and Napoleon blamed Snowball, declaring him a traitor. The animals pledged to capture Snowball. Napoleon demanded immediate reconstruction, reminding them of their mission.

With conflicting emotions, the animals continued rebuilding the windmillâ€”symbolising their resilience and determination.

## Chapter 7

Amid the harsh winter, the animals faced the daunting task of rebuilding the windmill. Lies spread about its collapse, but the animals persevered, collecting more stone despite treacherous snowdrifts.

Food shortages worsened, and Napoleon deceived the animals with false information. Desperate, he demanded the hens surrender their eggs, crushing their rebellion. Snowball became a scapegoat, and paranoia spread.

Executions and terror gripped the farm, driving the animals into fear and disillusionment. Boxer remained loyal but puzzled by the sudden turn of events. Under Napoleon's rule, the farm transformed into a place of oppression.

Clover mourned their lost dreams, and the farm became a distorted reality of inequality. "Beasts of England" was abolished and replaced by a song glorifying Napoleon's tyranny. The animals sang, longing for the old anthem and the world they once aspired to.

## Chapter 8

In the aftermath of the windmill's destruction, the animals rallied to rebuild, working tirelessly to increase food production. Napoleon's role diminished, with Squealer acting as his messenger, ensuring the animals stayed focused.

Negotiations with neighbouring farms turned sour when Frederick deceived them. He launched a surprise attack, destroying the windmill. The animals regrouped and fought back, reclaiming their farm.

Amidst their victory, Boxer realised the windmill would need rebuilding. The pigs indulged in drunken revelry, fueling speculation. Napoleon fell ill, sparking rumours of poisoning. He banned alcohol and ordered the ploughing of the grazing ground, confusing the animals.

A broken ladder and altered Commandments raised doubts. The animals grappled with trust as they sought to uphold the principles of Animalism and reclaim their vision of equality and justice.

## Chapter 9

Boxer, the diligent cart horse, worked tirelessly despite a split hoof. He sacrificed his retirement due to food shortages while the privileged pigs and dogs enjoyed privileges. Napoleon consolidated power as the President of the Republic.

Snowball was further demonised and accused of treason. Moses the Raven returned with tales of Sugarcandy Mountain, dividing the animals. Boxer's health declined, and a horse slaughterer took him away.

The animals mourned Boxer's loss. Squealer assured them he died peacefully, praising Napoleon. The pigs' banquet ended in discord, reflecting the fractured state of Animal Farm.

The animals grappled with grief, disillusionment, and a longing for the original ideals. They vowed to honour Boxer's memory and continue his unwavering commitment as they faced an uncertain future.

## Chapter 10

Over time, the animals on Animal Farm began to forget their revolutionary past, except for a few wise individuals. The farm had changed, with new buildings and a functioning windmill, but luxuries like electricity and shorter workweeks were forgotten dreams.

A divide emerged as the pigs and dogs lived privileged lives while the other animals struggled. Despite hardships, the animals held hope and believed in the Rebellion's principles.

But the pigs transformed, adopting human habits and altering the Commandments. They mingled with humans, blurring the line between species. The animals realised they had been deceived and were reduced to pawns in the pigs' power games.

Witnessing a quarrel between Napoleon and Mr Pilkington, the animals understood the revolution's betrayal. Their hope turned to disillusionment as they realised the price they had paid. They vowed to reclaim their farm and fight for true equality and freedom.

With renewed determination, the animals stood together, ready to unite and challenge the pigs' betrayal. Their future and the spirit of justice depended on their resilience and unwavering belief in a better world.
