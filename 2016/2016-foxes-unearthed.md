# Foxes Unearthed
**Authors**: Lucy Jones | **Year**: 2016 | **Category**: Science & Nature

## Summary
Foxes Unearthed explores Britain's complex and contradictory relationship with the red fox - a creature that inspires both passionate love and intense hatred. Jones investigates how this small carnivore has become a cultural lightning rod, representing everything from liberty and beauty to class conflict and cruelty. Through personal encounters, historical research, and interviews with hunters, saboteurs, farmers, and urban dwellers, she reveals how the fox reflects our deepest tensions about nature, tradition, and our place in the world.

This book will appeal to anyone interested in British cultural history, wildlife conservation, or human-animal relationships. Readers will gain a deeper understanding of how one species can embody a nation's contradictions and why the fox remains such a powerful symbol in modern Britain.

## Core Insights

### The Fox as Cultural Mirror
The fox in Britain is rarely perceived for what it actually is - a wild animal following its natural instincts. Instead, it serves as a projection screen for human values, fears, and desires. As Jones writes, "The currents that exist around the fox in Britain are powerful, old and complex. They have combined to create an enigmatic character, rarely perceived for what it actually is." The animal represents contradictory concepts: liberty versus pest, beauty versus vermin, hunter versus hunted.

The fox's cultural significance extends far beyond its ecological role. It features prominently in literature from medieval Reynard tales to Roald Dahl's Fantastic Mr. Fox, appears on pub signs and jewelry, and has inspired countless parliamentary debates. No other British animal provokes such extreme emotional responses or occupies such a contested space in the national imagination.

> "The fox has come to represent a thorny and emotive array of concepts to different people: from liberty to beauty, class to cruelty, hunter to hunted, pin-up to pest."

**Quick Take**: Our relationship with foxes reveals more about human society than about the animals themselves.

### The Hunting Paradox: Love and Loathing Coexisting
Perhaps the most fascinating discovery in Jones's investigation is that many fox hunters don't hate foxes at all - many actively love and respect them. This apparent contradiction runs deep in hunting culture, where participants often describe their quarry as beautiful, clever, and worthy adversaries. Some hunters even maintain fox habitats on their land, accepting occasional livestock losses as the "price of this."

Jones encounters numerous hunters who speak warmly of foxes, like Brian Fanshawe, who would pull up snares to protect foxes and once let a clever escapee go with wishes for a "happy new year." Roger Scruton kept a family of foxes on his farm "because he enjoyed having them around." This complex emotion combines respect for the fox's intelligence and cunning with the belief that hunting is necessary for population control and wildlife management.

> "It's common. Andrew Cook, the local Master of Foxhounds, who had observed more foxes than most, explained how much he respected his quarry: 'People will think that sounds mad but most purist fox hunters spend half the year hunting foxes and half the year preserving them. I like to see foxes about.'"

**Quick Take**: Human relationships with wild animals can accommodate seemingly contradictory emotions of admiration and exploitation.

### The Urban-Country Divide Embodied
The fox perfectly symbolizes Britain's urban-rural cultural divide. In cities, foxes are increasingly viewed as charismatic wildlife, neighbors in our shared urban spaces. In rural areas, they're more likely to be seen as pests threatening livestock and livelihoods. This geographical split reflects deeper cultural differences between urban and rural Britain.

The fox hunting debate crystallized these tensions. As Jones notes, farmers felt their interests "were not understood by Westminster and the urban majority." The 2004 hunting ban was perceived by many rural communities as an urban imposition on traditional country ways of life, yet urbanites saw it as a modernizing reform against cruel practices. The fox became a proxy war in broader cultural conflicts between traditional and progressive values, between those who see nature as something to be managed versus those who see it as something to be protected.

> "Fox hunting has fuelled the perceived divide between town- and country-dwellers for decades."

**Quick Take**: Wildlife management debates often reflect deeper cultural and political divisions between urban and rural populations.

### The Saboteurs: Radical Compassion
Jones provides fascinating insight into the hunt saboteur movement, which began in the 1960s when journalist John Prestige, horrified by seeing a pregnant stag ripped apart in someone's front garden, organized friends to disrupt hunts. These activists represent a form of radical compassion, willing to risk injury and legal consequences to protect animals.

Saboteurs have developed increasingly sophisticated tactics over decades, from simple horn-blowing to confuse hounds, to using drones and technology to document illegal hunting. Many sabs are vegans who see all life as equally precious, and they describe the euphoria of saving an animal's life as "walking on air." Their extreme dedication highlights how the fox can inspire not just hatred but also profound altruism and courage in humans.

> "The elation you feel, I can't describe it, you have to come sabbing, you have to save that life, you are walking on air."

**Quick Take**: Animals can inspire extraordinary courage and dedication in humans, sometimes leading to radical activism.

### Coexistence: The Future Relationship
Jones concludes that the fox's "villainy has much to do with our attitude to the earth and the way we treat it." The problems with foxes - whether in urban or rural settings - stem primarily from human behaviors and habits. Foxes thrive in cities because of our waste and because we've eliminated competing predators. They conflict with farmers because we've destroyed natural habitats and concentrated vulnerable livestock in specific areas.

The solution, Jones suggests, is reorganizing our priorities to recognize that humans don't stand apart from nature but are part of it. We can't expect to live as we do and not affect the world around us. This means accepting some level of coexistence with wildlife, even when it's inconvenient, and recognizing that many "pest" problems are human-created.

> "The idea that we stand apart from other living organisms, that we can exploit them or exclude them from what we deem as our space, doesn't add up to a healthy environment."

**Quick Take**: Human-wildlife conflicts require examining our own behaviors and assumptions rather than simply blaming animals.

## Best Quotes
- "The currents that exist around the fox in Britain are powerful, old and complex. They have combined to create an enigmatic character, rarely perceived for what it actually is."
- "In no other culture but Britain's is the animal so polarising and so complex a public figure."
- "While I agree with the argument that foxes should be controlled when necessary to protect rare and vulnerable species, the fox's perceived villainy has much to do with our attitude to the earth and the way we treat it."
- "The fox is a problem only in so far as it affects our own interests – and that problem is often exaggerated to suit other agendas."
- "In those seconds, I got the sense that we were one and the same, that we were both just animals, mammals, predators, denizens of this earth."

## Action Items
- Examine your own assumptions about animals considered "pests" or "vermin" - these labels often reflect human values rather than animal behavior
- Recognize that wildlife management conflicts usually involve complex ecological and social factors, not simple good-vs-evil narratives
- Consider how urban-rural divides affect your understanding of environmental and conservation issues
- Reflect on your relationship with local wildlife - what emotions do different species inspire and why?
- Support conservation approaches that acknowledge humans are part of ecosystems, not separate from them

## Questions to Consider
- Why do certain animals become cultural symbols while others remain simply wildlife?
- How much of our relationship with predators is about the animals themselves versus human cultural conflicts?
- Can hunting ever be compatible with conservation, or are they fundamentally opposed?
- What does our treatment of animals reveal about our values as a society?
- How can we balance human needs with wildlife conservation in increasingly crowded landscapes?

## Conclusion
Foxes Unearthed is worth your time because it goes far beyond a simple nature book to explore how one species can embody a nation's soul. Jones's investigation reveals that our relationship with foxes mirrors our relationship with nature itself - complicated, contradictory, and deeply meaningful. The biggest reason to read this book is its masterful weaving of personal narrative, cultural history, and contemporary issues that illuminates not just fox-human relationships, but human-human relationships as well.

The book demonstrates that the fox debate is about more than wildlife management - it's about tradition versus progress, rural versus urban values, and ultimately about how humans find our place in the natural world. Jones's balanced, compassionate approach shows that understanding the fox controversy means understanding ourselves better, making this book relevant even to those who've never given much thought to Vulpes vulpes.
