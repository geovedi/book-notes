# Business Plans That Get Investment
**Authors**: David Bateman | **Year**: 2016

## Summary
"Business Plans That Get Investment" transforms the daunting task of business plan writing into a straightforward, structured process that actually works. Written by someone who has experienced both sides of the investment table—as entrepreneur seeking funding and as investor evaluating proposals—this book delivers a battle-tested formula for creating business plans that attract investment and accelerate growth.

The book's core premise is revolutionary yet simple: effective business plans should be concise, visual presentations rather than verbose documents. Bateman advocates for a 14-page PowerPoint format with bullet points, arguing that less is truly more when it comes to capturing investor attention. This approach applies to any business, from early-stage startups to established companies seeking growth capital.

Entrepreneurs, business owners, and anyone seeking investment will gain a clear roadmap that eliminates guesswork and dramatically improves their chances of securing funding. The methodology is based on real-world experience rather than academic theory, making it immediately applicable and practical.

## Core Insights

### The PowerPoint Revolution
Traditional business plans fail because they're too long, too detailed, and focus on the wrong audience. Bateman's counterintuitive solution: use PowerPoint instead of Word. This forces brevity and clarity, creating a visual presentation that tells your business story slide by slide. Each slide covers one specific topic with maximum 6 bullet points, ensuring investors can quickly grasp your value proposition without wading through pages of text.

> "In this book I will show you how to write an effective, professional business plan of no more than fourteen pages, with as few as ten sentences per page!"
>
**Quick Take**: Presentation software forces you to think like you're pitching to investors, not writing a novel.

### The 14-Slide Structure That Works
The book's most valuable contribution is a proven 14-slide structure that addresses every investor concern in logical sequence. This structure works for any business type or investment size:

1. Executive Summary (written last)
2. Opportunity (the problem you solve)
3. Background (what your business does)
4. USP (what makes you different)
5. Progress (proof of concept)
6. Market (who your customers are)
7. Route to Market (how you reach them)
8. Competition (who else does this)
9. Management (who runs the business)
10. Business Model (how you make money)
11. Financials (numbers showing growth)
12. Investment (what you need and offer)
13. Exit (how investors get returns)
14. Conclusion (strong finish)

> "If you get the structure of your plan right you have done 80 per cent of the hard work – the rest is just filling in the gaps with detail!"

**Quick Take**: Structure eliminates guesswork and ensures you cover everything investors need to see.

### Think Like an Investor, Not an Entrepreneur
The fundamental mindset shift required for success: stop thinking about what you want to say and start thinking about what investors need to hear. Every slide should answer the questions investors actually ask, similar to those on Dragons' Den: "How much have you sold?" "How much money have you put in?" "Do you own the intellectual property?" "How will I get my money back?"

> "Your business plan is the medium that you use to communicate to potential investors what your business does and how they will be able to make money from it. You should think of it as an 'investment pitch'."

**Quick Take**: Investors don't care about your passion—they care about their returns. Show them how they'll profit.

### Proof of Concept Trumps Everything
The single most important factor in early-stage investment decisions is proof of concept. Investors need evidence that your business actually works and that customers will pay for your product or service. This can be sales, contracts, brand-name clients, patents, or meaningful progress. Without proof of concept, you're just selling ideas—with proof, you're selling a business.

> "If you can demonstrate a working product or service, and also show that people are prepared to pay for it, you have transformed your business from just an idea into a serious investment proposition."

**Quick Take**: Show, don't tell. Demonstrate actual progress rather than promising future potential.

### The Valuation Reality Check
Most entrepreneurs destroy their chances by overvaluing their businesses. Bateman provides a reality-based approach: value your business based on current profits (or sales if not profitable), typically 5-10x net profit after tax. Internet businesses command higher multiples due to growth potential, while mature businesses get lower multiples. Investors focus on current value, not future projections.

> "The problem stems from the fact that an investor will tend to look at what a business is worth now, whereas an inexperienced and perhaps naive business owner will not understand this, and will look just to the future in order to ascertain the business's value."

**Quick Take**: Anchor your valuation in today's reality, not tomorrow's dreams.

## Best Quotes
- "Keep it simple. Contrary to popular opinion, a business plan should always be concise and simple. It does not require excessive detail or reams of numbers."
- "A business plan must therefore be presented as a series of slides that contain key points. Bullet points are fundamental to the success of your business plan."
- "Less is definitely more. You need to think of writing your plan as something similar to writing a song: you don't have endless space to fill, because of the constraints on the length and structure of the song."
- "The fundamental point is this: if you don't know what you should be saying in the first place, or what investors want to hear, it's effectively impossible to get it down on paper."
- "If you aren't prepared to put any of your own money into the business, it sends a clear signal that you are not committed and that you do not really believe in what you are doing."
