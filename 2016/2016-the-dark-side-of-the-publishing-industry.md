**Authors**: Samuel River | **Year**: 2016 | **Category**: Business & Finance

## Summary
This explosive exposé reveals the hidden scams and systemic corruption within the modern self-publishing industry, particularly targeting Amazon's monopolistic practices. River, a prolific author with 230+ books, documents his decade-long battle against publishing giants who manipulate sales rankings, steal royalties, and suppress independent voices. The book serves as both a personal memoir and an industry investigation, demonstrating how less than 0.1% of authors can actually make a living from writing due to systemic barriers and market manipulation.

This book is essential reading for aspiring authors, independent publishers, and anyone interested in the economics of digital publishing. Readers will gain crucial insights into protecting their creative work, diversifying distribution channels, and understanding the true mechanics behind those appealing "publish your book easily" promises from major platforms.

## Core Insights

### The Amazon Monopoly Problem
Amazon's dominance in self-publishing has created an ecosystem where authors face systematic exploitation. Despite having 230 books published, River's income dropped from $500 to $100 monthly while his catalog grew fivefold. This statistical impossibility reveals how Amazon manipulates sales reporting and deliberately suppresses successful independent authors who threaten their preferred content creators.

> "Power corrupts the weak and absolute power corrupts absolutely, and transforms them into beasts. Amazon has surely went down that road."

**Quick Take**: Never rely exclusively on one publishing platform, no matter how attractive their terms appear initially.

### Review Manipulation Censorship
Amazon systematically deletes legitimate 5-star reviews from verified purchasers while allowing fake 1-star reviews from non-buyers to remain. River documented how Google Play gave him hundreds of legitimate 5-star reviews across his catalog, while Amazon users were blocked from reviewing books they actually purchased.

> "Amazon is full of shit and their reviews represent distorted realities, as I've received as well many negative reviews from readers that didn't even bought or read the books, and they also never explained how that happened."

**Quick Take**: Build your author reputation through multiple platforms and direct reader relationships, not Amazon reviews alone.

### Systemic Discrimination in Publishing
The publishing industry discriminates against authors based on appearance, nationality, and background. River discovered that removing his author photos increased sales by 10x in six months, as readers made prejudiced assumptions about his appearance and European background.

> "It's sad to realize it, but made me awake to the fact that racism and prejudice are still very common in a world that insists on not evolving much despite the social appearances indicating otherwise."

**Quick Take**: Consider strategic branding decisions while working to change industry prejudices through excellence and persistence.

### The Bestseller List Fraud
Nearly all bestselling lists are "total bullshit" according to River, who documented reaching Top 20 worldwide rankings above Harry Potter and 50 Shades of Grey while his sales reports showed minimal activity. This reveals how rankings are manipulated to promote favored authors and suppress others.

> "I do know that almost all the bestselling lists out there are a total bullshit, but nearly none of the readers, the outsiders, knows it."

**Quick Take**: Focus on building genuine reader relationships rather than chasing artificial ranking metrics.

## Best Quotes

- "Less than 0,1% of all the authors alive today can make a living from their books. Much less than that, really know what is going on inside the publishing industry."

- "This widespread cowardice, made me realize that most authors aren't really authors, but just writers, people that think their self-esteem can be built from writing and publishing a book, whatever the quality of such book might be."

- "I have a very strong feeling that the opposite of love is not hate but apathy."

- "In any moment of decision, the best thing you can do is the right thing, and the worst thing you can do is nothing."

- "Everything else beyond such need is delusional."

## Action Items

- **Diversify Publishing Platforms**: Never grant exclusivity to any single publisher or platform. Publish across multiple distributors to maintain leverage and reach.

- **Document Everything**: Keep detailed records of sales, communications, and suspicious activities. Evidence is crucial when challenging platform abuses.

- **Build Direct Reader Relationships**: Create email lists, social media presence, and direct sales channels independent of any single platform.

- **Know Your Rights**: Understand publishing contracts, royalty calculations, and consumer protection laws in your jurisdiction.

- **Support Author Advocacy**: Join organizations fighting for author rights and transparent publishing practices.

## Questions to Consider

- How can we create publishing platforms that serve authors rather than exploit them?

- What role should readers play in demanding transparency from publishing platforms?

- How might blockchain or decentralized technologies address trust issues in publishing?

- What responsibility do successful authors have to expose industry corruption?

- How can we distinguish legitimate publishing services from predatory ones?

## Conclusion

This book is worth reading for anyone considering self-publishing or interested in digital media economics. While River's tone can be confrontational and some claims lack verifiable proof, his decade of experience and detailed documentation provide valuable insights into publishing industry problems many authors have suspected but couldn't prove.

The biggest reason to read this book is understanding that the self-publishing dream sold by platforms like Amazon often hides a reality of exploitation and manipulation. By knowing these truths, authors can make informed decisions about their publishing strategy and avoid common pitfalls that derail countless writing careers.

River's most important contribution isn't just exposing problems but offering solutions - diversification, community building, and maintaining creative independence. These principles apply beyond publishing to any creator economy where platforms hold disproportionate power over individual creators.
