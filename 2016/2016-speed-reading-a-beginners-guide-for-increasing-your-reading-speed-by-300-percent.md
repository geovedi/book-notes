# Speed Reading: A Beginner's Guide for Increasing Your Reading Speed by 300%
**Authors**: Peter Jenner | **Year**: 2016 | **Category**: Self-Help & Personal Development

## Summary
This practical guide teaches readers how to triple their reading speed using simple, actionable techniques. The book breaks down speed reading into visual methods rather than traditional sub-vocalization, helping readers process text in chunks while maintaining comprehension. Perfect for students, professionals, and anyone looking to maximize their reading efficiency without sacrificing understanding.

The author demystifies speed reading by proving it's not about complex techniques or natural gifts, but about changing fundamental reading habits through consistent practice. Readers will learn to identify their current reading style, eliminate inefficiencies, and develop new neural pathways for faster text processing.

## Core Insights

### 1. Identify and Eliminate Sub-Vocalization
The biggest obstacle to speed reading is sub-vocalization—sounding out each word in your head. This natural habit limits you to your speaking speed (200-400 WPM) rather than your potential reading speed. Instead, practice **visual reading**: see the story or concept in your mind without hearing the words.

> "When you read that sentence, did you feel yourself sounding out each individual work, comprehending each word by itself, only focusing on one word at a time?"
> _Original: "When you read that sentence, did you feel yourself sounding out each individual work, comprehending each word by itself, only focusing on one word at a time?"_

**Quick Take**: Practice visualizing scenes as you read rather than hearing words. Start with simple sentences and work up to complex paragraphs.

### 2. Read in Chunks, Not Individual Words
Process sentences in meaningful groups rather than word-by-word. Like carrying multiple small boxes at once, your brain can handle 2-4 word chunks efficiently, dramatically increasing processing speed.

For example: "the cat jumped onto the sofa" becomes two chunks: "the cat jumped" and "onto the sofa." Your eyes scan each chunk while your brain builds the complete mental image.

**Quick Take**: Break sentences into 2-4 word phrases that naturally flow together, training your eyes to move smoothly between chunks.

### 3. Match Reading Speed to Content Type
Different materials require different approaches:
- **Skimming material** (pleasure reading): Fly through at maximum speed
- **Comprehension material** (work/school): Moderate speed with focus on key concepts
- **Memorization material** (textbooks): Slowest speed with attention to detail

**Quick Take**: Always identify your reading purpose first—this determines optimal speed and technique.

### 4. Use Your Finger as a Pacing Tool
Your finger is an excellent temporary pacer to maintain consistent speed and prevent your eyes from wandering or regressing. Move your finger at a steady pace, forcing your eyes to keep up.

**Progression method**:
- Weeks 1-2: Use finger for 2 paragraphs, then read 1 without it
- Weeks 3-4: Use finger for 1 paragraph, then read 2 without it
- Week 5+: Gradually eliminate finger dependence

**Quick Take**: Your finger sets tempo—keep it moving steadily and gradually increase speed.

### 5. Practice Deliberately and Progressively
Start with fun, easy material to build confidence before tackling complex texts. Practice consistently but don't rush the process. Old habits die hard, so patient, persistent practice beats rushed frustration.

**Practice strategy**:
- Begin with pleasure reading (easiest to skim)
- Progress to work/school materials
- Accept that memorization content will always be slower

**Quick Take**: Practice daily on enjoyable content first, then gradually increase difficulty.

## Best Quotes
- "The average person reads at about 200-400 words per minute... If you were to read that fast, it would only take you less than half a day to finish the [Harry Potter] series. That's saving more than 48 hours!"
- "Think of it like working for a moving company. Your job is to move thirty boxes from a house into the moving fan. But you're in luck, most of the boxes are actually very small and light! So would you go and grab these small boxes one by one to bring them outside? No!"
- "When we think about people who can read really fast, we think they must know complex reading techniques, or have practices for years, or are just simply gifted. But by now you know, that none of those things are true."

## Action Items
- Take a baseline speed reading test (Staples has a good online version)
- Practice visual reading for 15 minutes daily—create mental movies, don't hear words
- Use your finger as a pacer for 2 weeks, then gradually reduce dependence
- Break every sentence into 2-4 word chunks when reading
- Test your speed after each chapter to track progress
- Start speed reading practice with pleasure books before work materials

## Questions to Consider
- What type of reader are you currently—sub-vocal, auditory, or visual?
- How much time could you save weekly by tripling your reading speed?
- What specific types of material would benefit most from faster reading?
- Are you willing to temporarily reduce comprehension to build new habits?
- How will you measure your progress beyond just words per minute?

## Conclusion
This book delivers exactly what it promises: a straightforward system for reading up to 300% faster. The techniques are simple but require consistent practice to overcome lifetime reading habits. While you may not achieve immediate 3x speed increases, the visual reading method and chunking strategies will significantly boost your efficiency.

**Is it worth your time?** Absolutely if you read more than 30 minutes daily. The time investment pays for itself within weeks through increased productivity and more reading opportunities. The biggest reason to read it: you'll finally understand why speed reading champions can process 2000+ words per minute while maintaining 50% comprehension—it's not magic, just better technique.

**Final tip**: Take a baseline test, practice visual reading for 21 days, then measure your improvement. The results might surprise you.
