**Authors**: Bill Burnett, Dave Evans | **Year**: 2016 | **Category**: Self-Help & Personal Development

## Summary
"Designing Your Life" applies design thinking principles from Stanford's famous course to help you build a well-lived, joyful life. The book teaches that life isn't a problem to be solved but a creative process to be designed. Rather than searching for the single "perfect" path, you'll learn to generate multiple possibilities, prototype experiences, and make choices that align with your Work View and Life View.

This book is perfect for anyone feeling stuck in their career, uncertain about their next steps, or simply wanting to live more intentionally. Whether you're a recent graduate, mid-career professional, or someone seeking greater fulfillment, you'll gain practical tools to navigate life's crossroads with confidence and curiosity.

## Core Insights

### Design Thinking for Life
Life design uses the same principles that create innovative products: empathy, ideation, prototyping, and iteration. You are the designer of your life, and like any good designer, you don't need to have it all figured out—you just need to start the process. Focus on "wayfinding" rather than finding a single destination, and remember that there are multiple good lives you could live.

> "You can't think your way forward—you have to live your way forward."
> _Original: "You can't think your way forward—you have to live your way forward."_

**Quick Take**: Stop trying to solve your life like a math problem. Instead, approach it with curiosity and experimentation, treating each experience as data for your next design iteration.

### The Compass: Work View + Life View
Your personal compass consists of two essential components. Your Work View defines what work means to you and why it matters, while your Life View articulates your core beliefs about what makes life meaningful. When these two views align, you have a reliable compass for decision-making.

> "You can't be happy if your work view and life view are in conflict."
> _Original: "You can't be happy if your work view and life view are in conflict."_

**Quick Take**: Take time to articulate both your Work View and Life View. If they're in conflict, that's where you need to focus your design efforts first.

### Gravity Problems vs. Solvable Problems
Learn to distinguish between "gravity problems" (constraints you cannot change) and problems you can actually solve. Gravity problems are like trying to fight gravity—they're facts of life that require acceptance and adaptation, not solutions. Don't waste energy trying to solve unsolvable problems.

> "If it's not actionably solvable, it's not a problem. It's a situation, a circumstance, a fact of life."
> _Original: "If it's not actionably solvable, it's not a problem. It's a situation, a circumstance, a fact of life."_

**Quick Take**: Assess whether your current challenge is truly solvable. If it's a gravity problem, focus your energy on adapting to it rather than trying to change it.

### Energy Tracking and Flow States
Your body provides honest feedback about what energizes you versus what drains you. By keeping a "Good Time Journal," you can identify activities, environments, and interactions that put you in flow states where time seems to disappear. This data reveals your authentic preferences and natural talents.

> "The things that energize you are good clues about what you should be doing with your life."
> _Original: "The things that energize you are good clues about what you should be doing with your life."_

**Quick Take**: Track your energy levels for a week. Notice which activities make you feel alive and engaged—these are signposts pointing toward your best-fit work.

### Multiple Life Prototypes
Instead of committing to one five-year plan, design three different versions: your current path expanded, an alternative if your first plan becomes impossible, and a wild version if money and image didn't matter. This approach liberates you from the pressure of finding the "single right answer."

> "There is no one right solution to any problem, including the problem of how to live your life."
> _Original: "There is no one right solution to any problem, including the problem of how to live your life."_

**Quick Take**: Create three distinct 5-year plans. They don't need to be perfect—just plausible alternatives that expand your thinking about what's possible.

### Failure Immunity Through Prototyping
Reframe failure as learning by treating every career experiment as a prototype. When you approach life with an experimenter's mindset, there are no failures—only data points that help you design better next steps. This "infinite game" approach makes you resilient to setbacks.

> "Failure is just data."
> _Original: "Failure is just data."_

**Quick Take**: Start small with low-stakes experiments. Try volunteering, job shadowing, or informational interviews before making big life changes.

- "You are living a life that's designed. The question is: are you designing it, or is someone else designing it for you?"

## Action Items

- **Complete the Dashboard Exercise**: Create four gauges (Health, Work, Play, Love) and assess where you currently stand in each area. This baseline will help you identify where to focus your design efforts first.

- **Write Your Work View and Life View**: Take 30 minutes to articulate your beliefs about work and life. Then check for alignment—if they conflict, that's your first design challenge.

- **Start a Good Time Journal**: For one week, track your energy levels and engagement during different activities. Note what puts you in flow states and what drains your energy.

- **Conduct Three Conversational Interviews**: Reach out to people doing work that interests you. Ask about their journey, not for a job. Gather stories and insights about their experience.

- **Design Three Odyssey Plans**: Create three distinct 5-year visions for your life: your current path expanded, an alternative, and a "what if money/image didn't matter" version.

## Questions to Consider

- What activities make you lose track of time, and how could you incorporate more of them into your life?

- Which of your current problems are actually "gravity problems" that require acceptance rather than solutions?

- What small experiment could you try this month that might give you clarity about your next steps?

- Who in your life provides counsel rather than advice, and how could you engage them more in your design process?

- What would you attempt if you knew you couldn't fail—and how could you prototype a small version of that?

## Conclusion

"Designing Your Life" is worth your time because it transforms the overwhelming pressure of "figuring out your life" into an exciting creative process. The biggest reason to read this book is that it gives you permission to not have it all figured out, replacing anxiety with curiosity and indecision with experimentation.

The book's genius lies in making design thinking accessible and immediately applicable to life's biggest questions. Rather than offering abstract advice, it provides concrete tools that you can start using today. The exercises are simple but profound, creating self-awareness that leads to meaningful action.

What sets this book apart is its emphasis on prototyping and iteration over finding the "perfect" answer. You'll learn that there are multiple good lives you could live, and the goal is to start moving toward one while staying open to course corrections along the way.

Whether you're facing a major life decision or simply wanting to live more intentionally, this book provides both the mindset shift and practical toolkit to design a life that's not just successful, but joyful and meaningful.
