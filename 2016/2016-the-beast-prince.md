## Fast-Track Story Guide

### The Magical Discovery
Lisa, a curvy 20-year-old woman, finds herself transported through a mysterious doorway while playing Manhunt with cousins during her great-grandmother's funeral gathering in England. On the other side, she discovers it's daytime in a different world and meets Sharden, a prince cursed since birth to become a beast during the full moon.

### The Growing Connection
Trapped in the magical world (the doorway only works one way), Lisa and Sharden journey to his palace. Despite initial friction, they develop deep feelings. Lisa isn't frightened by his curse—she's fascinated by supernatural elements and falls for the man inside, not just his princely exterior.

### The Hidden Valley
Sharden takes Lisa to his secret place—a hidden valley with a small hut where he finds peace after his transformations. Here they consummate their relationship, sealing their love just hours before Sharden's 25th birthday when the curse becomes permanent.

### The Climactic Choice
Sharden disappears as the transformation begins, leaving Lisa heartbroken. An old woman (revealed to be the witch who cursed him, and also Lisa's biological mother) explains the curse's true nature. Lisa races to the palace dungeon where Sharden is imprisoned as a beast, declaring her love and acceptance of him in any form.

### The Broken Curse
Lisa's unconditional love breaks the curse before it becomes permanent. Sharden transforms back to human form, and they're free to marry. The epilogue reveals Lisa's mother is the witch (now freed from her own curse), and Lisa's biological father is the village Breadmaker.
