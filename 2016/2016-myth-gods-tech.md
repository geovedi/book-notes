## Summary
In a near-future Athens where technology corporations reign supreme, teenage Mahi receives a revolutionary "Veil" smartphone from her father's employer, Hermes Information Technology. The device, designed to blur the lines between virtual and real reality, accidentally triggers manifestations of ancient Greek mythological beings - particularly the Erinyes (Furies) who personify guilt and punishment. As Mahi finds herself relentlessly pursued by these supernatural entities that only she can see, she discovers that other "users" are experiencing similar hallucinations. The story evolves into a multi-layered narrative exploring corporate conspiracy, technological dependence, and the timeless power of myth to adapt to modern contexts.

The novel will appeal to science fiction enthusiasts, mythology lovers, and readers interested in contemporary Greek culture. It offers a unique blend of cyberpunk aesthetics with classical themes, asking profound questions about guilt, responsibility, and how ancient stories manifest in our technology-saturated world.

## Core Insights

### The Veil Technology: Augmented Reality Gone Wrong
The "Veil" phone represents more than just advanced technology - it's a gateway between digital and mythological realms. The device's augmented reality capabilities accidentally tap into something ancient and primal, allowing users' inner guilt and psychological burdens to manifest as tangible mythological creatures. This brilliant concept explores how technology might inadvertently awaken dormant aspects of human consciousness rather than simply creating new experiences.

> "I took her place. That's the reason I am telling you all this. Oh god what was I thinking?"

**Quick Take**: Our technological creations may inadvertently unleash forces we don't understand, turning digital innovations into psychological battlegrounds.

### The Erinyes: Ancient Guilt in Modern Form
The Furies (Erinyes) represent the novel's central metaphor - how guilt pursues and punishes regardless of era or technology. These mythological entities chase Mahi in 109-minute cycles, forcing her to live life in desperate fragments. The brilliant twist lies in how the author personalizes each person's Erinyes based on their specific burdens, suggesting that technology doesn't create new problems but rather gives ancient ones new forms.

> "The Erinyes who dwell below and take vengeance on man on him who shall swear falsely."

**Quick Take**: Our deepest fears and guilt follow us regardless of technological advancement - they simply adapt to new environments.

### Corporate Power and Technological Dependence
Hermes Information Technology represents the modern pantheon - gods of commerce and innovation demanding human sacrifice. The novel critiques how corporations replace traditional authority structures, becoming the new arbiters of reality and experience. Mahi's father's job insecurity and the company's willingness to endanger users for profit highlight how technological progress often serves corporate interests more than human welfare.

> "There is a lot of money funnelled on this release. I already said yes, we can't afford me losing my job."

**Quick Take**: Modern corporations have become the new gods, demanding worship through consumption and dependence.

### Multiple Perspectives: The Omnibus Structure
The novel interweaves multiple storylines, including a reimagined Christmas Carol featuring a modern-day Scrooge who runs an accounting service. This narrative complexity mirrors the mythological tradition of interconnected stories, showing how different human experiences - teenage anxiety, corporate greed, redemption - all connect through universal themes of guilt and transformation.

**Quick Take**: Like ancient myths, modern stories gain power through their connections to broader human experiences.
