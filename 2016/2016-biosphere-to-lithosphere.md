# Biosphere to Lithosphere: New Studies in Vertebrate Taphonomy
**Editors**: Terry O'Connor (Editor), Peter Rowley-Conwy, Umberto Albarella, Keith Dobney (Series Editors) | **Year**: 2016

## Summary
This comprehensive academic volume presents cutting-edge research in vertebrate taphonomy - the study of how animal remains transition from living organisms (biosphere) to fossilized evidence (lithosphere). Originating from the 9th International Council of Archaeozoology conference, the book brings together diverse research approaches spanning from the Lower Pleistocene to recent history across Arctic, European, Middle Eastern, and South American contexts. The collection demonstrates how taphonomic studies have evolved from simply correcting for environmental biases to becoming a powerful tool for reconstructing human behavior and environmental conditions.

Archaeologists, zooarchaeologists, and paleontologists will find invaluable insights into interpreting bone assemblages, understanding site formation processes, and distinguishing between human and natural modification of animal remains. The book's interdisciplinary approach makes it essential for anyone involved in archaeological interpretation or Quaternary studies.

## Core Insights

### The Foundations and Evolution of Taphonomy
The book opens with Efremov's classic definition: "The chief problem of this branch of science is the study of the transition (in all its details) of animal remains from the biosphere into the lithosphere." The editors trace how taphonomy has transformed from a palaeontological discipline to a uniquely archaeological field that reveals human behaviors and environmental conditions rather than simply correcting sampling biases.

> "Taphonomy brought to a close the era when the study of animal bones and plant remains from archaeological sites were regarded mainly as environmental indicators. No longer were taphonomic factors seen as distorting the nature of the sample; they became instead the very object of enquiry, revealing a great deal about both human behaviour and about natural conditions on the site."

**Quick Take**: Modern taphonomy views bone modifications not as problems to correct but as data to interpret.

### Three Research Approaches
The volume organizes taphonomic research into three main categories: modern field observations applied by analogy to archaeological evidence, experimental investigations of specific bone degradation factors, and archaeological studies where taphonomic analysis forms a major component. This methodological diversity reflects the field's maturity and interdisciplinary nature.

**Quick Take**: Multiple research approaches converge to create a more complete understanding of bone assemblage formation.

### Death as a Critical Transitional Stage
The book emphasizes that the cause of death - often overlooked in taphonomic studies - provides crucial information about human-animal relationships and site formation processes. Beyond anthropogenic deaths, natural deaths, predation by commensal animals, and random events all contribute to the archaeological record in interpretable ways.

The editors use the metaphor of "Alkan's Bookcase" - the composer Charles-Valentin Alkan's death by falling bookcase - to illustrate how seemingly random deaths often follow predictable patterns based on individual attributes and environmental contexts.

**Quick Take**: Understanding how and why animals died provides essential context for interpreting archaeological assemblages.

### Bone-Sediment Interactions
Recent advances show that bone doesn't just passively respond to burial conditions - it actively modifies its environment. Degrading bone fragments alter sediment chemistry, drainage patterns, and microbial communities, potentially affecting the preservation of other archaeological materials.

**Quick Take**: Bone is both preserved by and preserves the sedimentary matrix, creating complex preservation feedback loops.

### Biomolecular Revolution
The book highlights emerging research on DNA and biomolecule preservation in ancient bones, demonstrating how analytical advances are opening new avenues for understanding species relationships, individual identification, and even disease in past populations.

**Quick Take**: Molecular taphonomy is expanding the questions we can answer with archaeological bone assemblages.

### Case Studies from Diverse Contexts
Research spans reindeer decomposition in Greenland, bird bone accumulation by raptors, experimental burning studies, and regional settlement pattern analysis. These studies demonstrate taphonomic principles' applicability across different environments, time periods, and research questions.

**Quick Take**: Taphonomic principles operate consistently across diverse archaeological and environmental contexts.

## Best Quotes
- "The chief problem of this branch of science is the study of the transition (in all its details) of animal remains from the biosphere into the lithosphere, i.e., the study of a process in the upshot of which the organisms pass out of the different parts of the biosphere and, being fossilized, become part of the lithosphere" (Efremov 1940)
- "Taphonomy brought to a close the era when the study of animal bones and plant remains from archaeological sites were regarded mainly as environmental indicators. No longer were taphonomic factors seen as distorting the nature of the sample; they became instead the very object of enquiry, revealing a great deal about both human behaviour and about natural conditions on the site."
- "The death, decay, and deposition of vertebrates is a fascinating subject, and a rich vein for research. The papers presented here show something of the diversity and maturity of that research, and reflect the 'buzz' of a particularly satisfactory conference session."
- "Different individuals within a population will be more or less likely to survive in that altered environment, depending on individual attributes of age, sex, health, breeding condition, and so on, but the enhanced probability of death is likely to affect all of them to some degree."
- "This diversity makes the point that vertebrate taphonomy is highly interdisciplinary. It has aspects that are essentially palaeontology, based on principles of biostratinomy that would apply equally to Quaternary proboscideans or to Permian therapsids."

## Key Methodologies
- **Experimental taphonomy**: Controlled studies of bone modification processes including burning, digestion, and weathering
- **Modern analogues**: Observations of recent death assemblages for interpreting archaeological contexts
- **Biomolecular analysis**: DNA and protein preservation studies in ancient bone
- **Quantitative analysis**: Statistical approaches to bone assemblage interpretation
- **Cross-disciplinary integration**: Combining zooarchaeology with geoarchaeology, paleobotany, and other specializations

## Questions to Consider
- How can we better distinguish between random natural deaths and patterned human activity in archaeological assemblages?
- What methodological standards should guide biomolecular taphonomy research as analytical techniques advance?
- How do taphonomic processes vary between different climate zones and environmental contexts?
- How can we integrate taphonomic insights more effectively into broader archaeological interpretations?
- What new research avenues will molecular technologies open for traditional taphonomic studies?

## Conclusion
This volume demonstrates that vertebrate taphonomy has evolved from a peripheral concern to a central methodological approach in archaeology. The book's strength lies in its diversity - geographical, temporal, and methodological - showing how taphonomic insights enhance interpretations ranging from individual site formation to regional settlement patterns. While technically detailed and clearly aimed at specialists, the volume's introductory sections and concluding essays provide valuable frameworks for understanding how bone assemblages form and what they can tell us about past human behaviors and environments.

The book is worth your time if you work with archaeological faunal materials, teach zooarchaeology, or need to understand site formation processes. Its greatest contribution is showing how taphonomic analysis transforms from a correctional procedure to a primary source of information about past human-animal relationships and environmental conditions.
