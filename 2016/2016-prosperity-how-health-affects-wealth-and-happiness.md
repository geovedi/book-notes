# Prosperity: How Health Affects Wealth and Happiness

**Authors**: Robin Sacredfire | **Year**: 2016 | **Category**: Self-Help & Personal Development

## Summary

This book explores the fundamental connection between physical and mental health and our ability to generate wealth and happiness. The author argues that money is an energy form that responds to our overall vibrational state, meaning our health directly influences our financial success and emotional well-being. Through personal experiences and observations, the book reveals how poor health creates negative cycles that drain both our finances and happiness, while optimal health creates positive momentum that attracts opportunities and abundance.

The book is particularly valuable for entrepreneurs, freelancers, and anyone seeking to break free from the traditional work paradigm, as it challenges conventional wisdom about career, money, and success. Readers will learn to understand money as a tool rather than an end goal, recognize how their physical and emotional states affect their financial outcomes, and discover practical approaches to elevating their energetic frequency to attract wealth and happiness naturally.

## Core Insights

### Money as Energy and Transaction
Money isn't real - it's simply a commonly accepted form of transaction that represents many other, more subtle exchanges like smiles, compliments, and positive interactions. When we understand money as energy rather than an end goal, we can see how our physical and emotional state affects our ability to attract it. The author experienced this firsthand when multiple part-time jobs he loved generated more income than any full-time position, simply because they carried a healthy, positive vibration.

> "Money is just one form of transaction. Smiling and complements are two of them. If you can't smile at someone that won't smile back at you or give complements to an individual that insists in offending you, then you've understood the meaning of conducting a transaction."

**Quick Take**: Focus on elevating your energetic state rather than chasing money directly. When you operate from a place of health and joy, financial opportunities naturally flow toward you.

### The Health-Wealth Spiral
Poor health and lack of money often create a self-perpetuating downward spiral. The author's worst period came when following conventional wisdom by keeping a "normal" full-time office job, which led to depression, frequent illness, and financial struggle. The more sick he became, the less money he had - partially due to medical expenses, but more fundamentally because poor health drains the vital energy needed to attract and seize opportunities.

> "The worse time of my life was when I though I should follow the majority, what I was told that was best for me, and keep a normal full-time job in an office. I was depressed, always sick and broke."

**Quick Take**: Breaking the health-wealth spiral requires recognizing that working harder at unfulfilling work often makes you sicker and poorer, not richer.

### The Diet-Vibration Connection
What we eat directly affects our emotional state and energetic frequency. The author explains how consuming animal products from abused animals means ingesting their pain, fear, and depression - effectively consuming low vibrations. Similarly, vegetables grown with powerful chemicals carry anxiety and restlessness. This affects not just our physical health but our ability to manifest positive outcomes in life.

> "If you eat the meat of animals that have lived their entire life trapped in a small environment, getting injected with things we barely know how might affect us, and being abused in a multitude of forms, you're eating pain, sadness and depression."

**Quick Take**: Choose foods that carry positive energetic vibrations - ideally organic plant-based options that nourish both body and spirit.

### Spirit vs. Personality in Wealth Creation
Many people confuse their personality (static values and learned behaviors) with their true self or spirit. The personality operates like a rat-wheel, creating the illusion of movement without real progress. True wealth creation requires connecting with your spiritual self rather than operating from personality-driven limitations and excuses.

> "Most people have no idea that having a personality is actually a very bad thing, as the personality represents the static values, and you can't progress with static values."

**Quick Take**: Move beyond personality limitations by connecting with your spiritual essence, which sees possibilities rather than obstacles.

### Movement and Wealth Attraction
Money likes movement and wealth enjoys energy. The most prosperous people tend to travel frequently and maintain dynamic lifestyles. This isn't just about physical movement but energetic dynamism - the willingness to embrace change, take action, and remain flexible. High-vibration individuals naturally experience more career changes, relocations, and opportunities because energy attracts similar energy.

> "Whatever the demand being manifested is, the fact is that money likes movement and wealth enjoys energy. This dynamic manifests with space and actions."

**Quick Take**: Embrace movement and change in your life - both physical and metaphorical - to increase your energetic frequency and attract greater wealth opportunities.

## Best Quotes

- "Money is not real and you need to start from this viewpoint in order to understand what it really is. Money is a tool, a path but not an end."
- "People's addictions and illusions is what kills them but not before they deliberately choose to be ignorant about it."
- "The only way out of the mental prison is through the spirit. And, until you know what the difference between your brain and your spirit is, you'll always be cheating on yourself when thinking about who you are or what you can do in life."
- "When a person looks at an issue and says: 'It takes time to solve it' this answer is an assumption of the personality, a self-defense mechanism."
- "Resting our body and mind when needed is very important but I'm not talking about laying down in bed and watching movies all day long. Resting means doing interesting things in nature, walking, breathing fresh air, putting our feet on the ground and feel the earth beneath them."

## Action Items

- **Audit your energy sources**: Identify which activities, foods, environments, and relationships raise or lower your vibrational state
- **Embrace natural rest**: Replace passive entertainment with active restoration in nature - walking barefoot, breathing fresh air, and connecting with the earth
- **Question your personality programming**: Notice when your "brain" offers excuses versus when your "spirit" sees possibilities
- **Choose high-vibration foods**: Opt for organic, plant-based foods that carry positive energetic qualities rather than fear-based animal products or chemically-treated produce
- **Welcome movement and change**: Rather than resisting career or location changes, view them as opportunities to increase your energetic frequency and attract greater abundance

## Questions to Consider

- How much of your current work situation reflects your true desires versus societal programming?
- What foods, environments, or activities consistently drain your energy versus elevate it?
- Where in your life do you confuse personality limitations with spiritual possibilities?
- How might your financial situation change if you prioritized health and happiness over conventional success metrics?
- What movement or change have you been resisting that might actually increase your wealth potential?

## Conclusion

This book is worth your time if you're feeling trapped in the conventional work-health-wealth paradigm and suspect there's a deeper connection between your physical state and financial outcomes. The biggest reason to read it is to challenge your fundamental assumptions about money, health, and success - potentially leading to profound shifts in how you approach all three areas of life.

While some concepts may seem esoteric, the core message is practical and empowering: your health isn't just about avoiding disease, it's about creating the energetic conditions for wealth and happiness to flow naturally into your life. The book serves as both a wake-up call and a roadmap for anyone ready to break free from limiting patterns and create prosperity through genuine well-being rather than struggle and sacrifice.
