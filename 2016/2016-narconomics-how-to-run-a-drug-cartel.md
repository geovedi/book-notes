# Narconomics: How to Run a Drug Cartel
**Author**: Tom Wainwright | **Year**: 2016

## Summary
Narconomics reveals how drug cartels operate like multinational corporations, applying business principles to the illegal drug trade. Wainwright, former Mexico City correspondent for The Economist, demonstrates that cartels use sophisticated strategies involving supply chain management, marketing, human resources, and R&D. By analyzing cartels through an economic lens, the book shows why traditional drug policies often fail and suggests business-thinking approaches could be more effective in combating organized crime.

This book offers valuable insights for policy makers, economists, law enforcement professionals, and business readers interested in understanding the economics of illicit markets. Readers will gain a fresh perspective on how applying business analysis to criminal organizations can reveal unexpected solutions to the drug problem.

## Core Insights

### Cartels Follow Business School Principles
Drug cartels operate remarkably similar to legitimate multinational corporations, with sophisticated organizational structures and business strategies. They manage supply chains, handle human resources, engage in mergers and acquisitions, and even worry about corporate social responsibility. The book argues that recognizing cartels as businesses rather than just criminal enterprises is crucial for understanding their behavior and developing effective counter-strategies.

> "The following chapters will add flesh to these arguments. But the bottom line is this: predicting the cartels' next steps, and making sure that the money and lives laid down to stop them are not wasted, is easier when we recognize that they are run like other big multinational companies."

**Quick Take**: Treat drug cartels as business competitors, not just criminal organizations, to better predict their strategies and vulnerabilities.

### Supply Chain Management Creates Market Power
Cartels demonstrate sophisticated supply chain control, acting as monopsonies (dominant buyers) rather than monopolies. Like Walmart, they dictate prices to farmers while protecting their own profit margins. When governments eradicate coca crops, cartels force farmers to absorb costs rather than raising retail prices. This explains why supply-side drug policies often fail - they hurt poor farmers but barely impact cartels' bottom lines.

> "The cartels' Walmart-like grip on their supply chains means that any worsening in coca-growing conditions simply makes poor farmers even poorer, without doing much to cut the cartels' profits or raise the price of cocaine for consumers."

**Quick Take**: Supply chain control gives cartels market power that insulates them from traditional supply-side drug policies.

### Competition vs. Collusion in Criminal Markets
Cartels strategically choose between violent competition and peaceful collusion based on economic incentives. When markets are fragmented, violence increases as groups battle for territory. However, cartels often find that mergers and alliances are more profitable than fighting - leading to temporary truces and market-sharing agreements. This explains why violence levels fluctuate in different regions and time periods.

> "Why did one market see heightened competition and the other collusion? Mexico's cartels and El Salvador's maras operate in the same region of the world, dealing the same products, and with the same readiness to resort to violence."

**Quick Take**: Cartel violence follows economic logic - they fight when competition offers better returns than cooperation.

### Innovation and R&D Drive Market Resilience
Cartels invest heavily in research and development to stay ahead of law enforcement and improve efficiency. They've developed new chemical processes that increase cocaine yields by 60% from the same amount of coca leaves. This innovation counteracts government eradication efforts and keeps prices stable despite supply reduction attempts. Cartels also adapt technology like washing machines as centrifuges and mobile laboratories to avoid detection.

> "The cartels are permanently shopping around for what they can do better. The process has changed dramatically. They are using new chemical precursors, and new machinery."

**Quick Take**: Cartels' innovation capabilities make them remarkably resilient to traditional drug enforcement strategies.

### Franchising and Offshoring Strategies
Cartels use franchising models similar to McDonald's, allowing local operators to use their brand and distribution networks in exchange for fees. They also offshore operations to countries with weaker law enforcement or favorable geography. These strategies help cartels expand while minimizing risk and maximizing operational flexibility.

**Quick Take**: Cartels borrow legitimate business strategies like franchising and offshoring to optimize their operations.

### Legalization Disrupts Cartel Business Models
Legal marijuana markets demonstrate how legitimate businesses can outcompete cartels through quality control, innovation, and customer service. Legal operations benefit from economies of scale, laboratory testing, product variety, and marketing capabilities that illegal dealers cannot match. However, legalization also creates new challenges as legal products flow into illegal markets.

> "The legal market has become the black market for the rest of the United States."

**Quick Take**: Legalization can undermine cartel business models, but only if implemented carefully to prevent leakage into illegal markets.

## Best Quotes
- "This book is a business manual for drug lords. But it is also a blueprint for how to defeat them."
- "Crooks already know these tricks. Honest men must learn them in self-defense."
- "Attempts to raise the price of cocaine by forcing up the cost of coca leaves is a bit like trying to drive up the price of art by raising the cost of paint."
- "Why economists make the best police officers."
- "The cartels are permanently shopping around for what they can do better."

## Action Items
- **For Policy Makers**: Apply business analysis rather than purely criminal justice approaches to drug policy
- **For Law Enforcement**: Target cartels' business model vulnerabilities rather than just individual operations
- **For Economists**: Study illicit markets as legitimate businesses to better understand their dynamics
- **For Business Leaders**: Examine how legitimate business practices are adopted by criminal organizations
- **For Citizens**: Consider economic incentives behind drug policy proposals rather than just moral arguments

## Questions to Consider
- If treating cartels as businesses reveals their vulnerabilities, why do most governments persist with purely criminal justice approaches?
- How can governments create competition in drug markets to break cartel monopsony power over farmers?
- What business principles could governments adopt to compete more effectively with cartels?
- If legalization undermines cartels, why hasn't it been implemented more widely?
- How might cartels adapt to increased legalization in the future?

## Conclusion
Narconomics offers a brilliant reframing of the drug problem, showing how business thinking reveals both cartels' strengths and vulnerabilities. Wainwright demonstrates that many drug policies fail because they ignore basic economic principles. The book's biggest insight is that cartels succeed not despite following business principles, but because they follow them so effectively. Understanding this could revolutionize drug policy and make enforcement efforts far more effective.

The book is essential reading for anyone serious about addressing drug-related violence and crime. Its business-focused approach doesn't solve every problem, but it provides powerful analytical tools that have been missing from drug policy discussions. By treating cartels as businesses rather than just criminal organizations, we gain the ability to predict their behavior, identify their vulnerabilities, and develop more intelligent strategies to combat them.
