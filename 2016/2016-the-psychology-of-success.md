# The Psychology of Success
**Authors**: Alison Price, David Price | **Year**: 2016 | **Category**: Psychology & Mental Health

## Summary
The Psychology of Success presents a comprehensive A-Z guide to achieving genuine fulfillment and accomplishment by combining insights from four disciplines: traditional psychology, positive psychology, motivational coaching, and sports psychology. The book challenges conventional wisdom about success by revealing that achieving goals alone doesn't guarantee happiness—what matters is setting the right goals and enjoying both the journey and destination.

This practical guide is perfect for anyone feeling stuck in their personal or professional life, those who've achieved goals but still feel unfulfilled, or anyone seeking a scientifically-backed approach to lasting success and happiness. Readers will learn to overcome limiting beliefs, set effective goals, leverage psychological principles for peak performance, and create sustainable motivation that extends far beyond initial achievement.

## Core Insights

### Goal Setting: Specific and Challenging Goals Beat "Best Efforts"
Research shows that vague "do your best" goals consistently underperform compared to specific, challenging goals with regular progress monitoring. The authors share how one of them went from failing at running to completing the London Marathon by setting specific targets like "run 5km" rather than "run as far as possible."

> "A goal is a dream with a deadline."
> _Napoleon Hill_

**Quick Take**: Replace "do your best" with specific, measurable targets and track your progress regularly.

### Fear Management: Nothing Has Meaning Except What We Give It
Our perceptions shape our reality and behavior. The book demonstrates through personal examples (spider phobia) that fear isn't inherent—it's created by our interpretation. By questioning whether our fears are based in reality, we can break free from limitations that hold us back from taking action toward our goals.

> "Nothing has meaning except for the meaning we give to it ourselves."
> _T. Harv Eker_

**Quick Take**: Challenge your fears by asking "Is this actually real, or just my interpretation?"

### Visualization: Making the Impossible Possible
Extraordinary achievers visualize what seems impossible until it becomes possible. The book shares the inspiring story of Steve, who arranged for Olympic gold medalist Sally Gunnell to surprise his team simply by daring to visualize what seemed impossible and taking action despite apparent limitations.

> "Ordinary people believe only in the possible. Extraordinary people visualize not what is possible or probable, but rather what is impossible. And by visualizing the impossible, they begin to see it as possible."
> _Cherie Carter-Scott_

**Quick Take**: Visualize your desired outcome in detail, then work backward to make it possible.

### The Happiness Advantage: Success Follows Happiness
Modern society has the formula backwards—working hard to become successful to become happy. Research shows that happiness actually precedes success. Studies found that children and doctors primed to feel happy performed up to 50% better on tasks. Happiness is the winning ingredient that enhances performance across all areas of life.

> "Modern society has put the cart before the horse. In the past we thought that if you worked hard and were successful, then you would be happy. Turns out we have gotten the order wrong all along."
> _Shawn Achor_

**Quick Take**: Cultivate happiness first through gratitude, positive memories, and small wins to boost your success potential.

### Self-Belief: Breaking Negative Self-Fulfilling Prophecies
When others label us negatively (like Sally Gunnell being told she was the "wrong colour and wrong shape" for Olympic success), those prophecies can become reality—unless we actively break them. The book outlines how to question negative assumptions and replace limiting beliefs with empowering ones.

**Quick Take**: Question others' limitations about you and choose your own empowering beliefs instead.
