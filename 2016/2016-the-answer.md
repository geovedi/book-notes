**Authors**: Allan Pease, Barbara Pease | **Year**: 2016

## Summary
"The Answer" is a practical guide to taking charge of your life and becoming the person you want to be. The book reveals how to program your brain's Reticular Activating System (RAR) - a neural network in the brainstem that acts as a filter for information and attention - to achieve your goals and create the life you desire.

This book is perfect for anyone feeling stuck, seeking direction, or wanting to understand the scientific basis behind goal achievement and personal transformation. Readers will learn actionable strategies for setting clear goals, overcoming obstacles, dealing with negative influences, and reprogramming their minds for success.

## Core Insights

### The Reticular Activating System (RAR) - Your Brain's GPS
The RAR is a bundle of nerve fibers in the brainstem that filters incoming information and determines what you notice. It processes over 400 million bits of information per second but only allows about 2,000 bits to reach your conscious awareness. This system can be programmed to focus on whatever you consistently think about, making it the biological basis for the "law of attraction."

> "Whatever you think about or focus on seeps into your subconscious and returns at some time in the future."
> _Original: "Bármit, amire gondolsz vagy figyelsz, beszivárog a tudatalattidba, és visszatér valamikor a jövőben."_
**Quick Take**: Your RAR works like a search engine - program it with what you want, not what you don't want.

### Define Exactly What You Want
Clear, specific goals are essential because the RAR needs precise instructions to work effectively. Vague goals like "I want to be rich" don't work, but specific targets like "I will have a net worth of one million dollars by August 15th, five years from now" give your RAR clear direction.

> "The absence of clearly defined goals leads to our weirdly faithful devotion to daily trivia until we finally become their slaves."
> _Original: "A világosan meghatározott célok hiányában mindennapi triviális dolgokat kezdjük furcsa hűséggel elvégezni, míg végül a rabszolgájukká nem válunk."_
**Quick Take**: Your brain needs a clear destination to navigate toward - make your goals specific, measurable, and time-bound.

### The Power of Deadlines
Dreams become goals when you attach deadlines to them. Deadlines create urgency, focus your energy, and trigger your RAR to find solutions. They also prepare your body chemically for the task ahead, increasing your strength and drive.

> "A deadline is the trigger for the gun of your goals."
> _Original: "A határidő olyan a céljaidnak, mint a ravasz a puskának."_
**Quick Take**: Set realistic but challenging deadlines, and break large goals into smaller, manageable steps.

### Overcome External Resistance
When you pursue ambitious goals, you'll face resistance from others - often from well-meaning friends and family. Understand their motives: genuine concern, feeling exposed by your ambition, or being intimidated by your courage. Learn to thank them for their concern while staying committed to your path.

> "When you're writing the story of your life, don't let anyone else hold the pen."
> _Original: "Amikor életed történetét írod, ne hagyd, hogy más vezesse a tollat!"_
**Quick Take**: Share your dreams only with those who truly support you, and develop strategies to handle naysayers constructively.

### Take Action Despite Fear
Success requires moving forward despite fear and uncertainty. The authors emphasize that you don't need to see the whole staircase - just take the first step. Action creates clarity and momentum, while overthinking leads to paralysis.

> "Sometimes the smallest step in the right direction ends up being the biggest step of your life."
> _Original: "Néha a legkisebb lépés a helyes irányba életed legnagyobb lépése lehet."_
**Quick Take**: Start now, adjust as you go, and remember that imperfect action is better than perfect inaction.

## Best Quotes

- "Life should not be a journey to the grave with the intention of arriving safely in a pretty and well-preserved body, but rather to skid in broadside, thoroughly used up, totally worn out, and loudly proclaiming, 'Wow! What a ride!'"
  _Original: "Az életnek nem olyan, a sírhoz vezető utazásnak kell lennie, ahol a lényeg, hogy csinosan, jó karban lévő testtel érkezzünk meg, hanem inkább olyannak, ahol sivító férekkel, porfelhőt kavarva csúszunk be a célba, teljesen elhasználódva és kimerülve, s hangosan kiáltjuk: 'Hű, micsoda menet volt!'"_

- "If you can think it, you can do it."
  _Original: "Ha el tudod képzelni, meg is tudod tenni."_

- "It's better to look back on your life and say 'I can't believe I did that!' than to say 'I wish I had done that!'"
  _Original: "Jobb úgy visszatekinteni az életedre és azt mondani, hogy 'Hihetetlen, hogy megtettem!', mint azt mondani, hogy 'Bárcsak megtettem volna!'"_

- "Winners are not those who never fail, but those who never quit."
  _Original: "Nem azok a győztesek, akik soha nem vallanak kudarcot. Azok a győztesek, akik soha nem adják fel."_

## Conclusion

"The Answer" is absolutely worth your time if you're looking for practical, scientifically-backed strategies for personal transformation. Unlike many self-help books that rely on vague positive thinking, the Peases provide concrete techniques based on neuroscience, particularly the functioning of the Reticular Activating System.

The book stands out for its emphasis on specific, measurable goals with deadlines, its realistic approach to dealing with naysayers, and its practical techniques for reprogramming your mind. The 25-year perspective from the authors (who first wrote about body language in the 1980s) adds wisdom and depth to their advice.

While some concepts may be familiar to readers of self-help literature, the RAR explanation and the structured approach to goal setting make this book valuable even for experienced personal development enthusiasts.
