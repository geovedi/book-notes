# Make Way for the Superhumans
**Authors**: Michael Bess | **Year**: 2016

## Summary
"Make Way for the Superhumans" explores the imminent transformation of humanity through bioenhancement technologies. Michael Bess presents a sober yet compelling vision of a future where pharmaceuticals, bioelectronics, and genetic engineering will fundamentally reshape human capabilities, extending lifespans to 160 years, dramatically boosting cognition, and allowing precise control over physical and mental states. The book argues that this revolution is not just coming—it's already underway, driven by irresistible human desires for better health, enhanced abilities, and competitive advantage.

The book is essential reading for policymakers, healthcare professionals, technologists, and citizens concerned about the future of human society. It provides a balanced framework for understanding both the tremendous benefits and profound risks that bioenhancement technologies present, offering practical guidance for navigating the ethical and social challenges ahead.

## Core Insights

### The Inevitability of Bioenhancement
Advanced enhancement technologies will become widespread not through deterministic forces, but because people will actively choose them. These technologies prove irresistibly desirable once declared safe and available. The transformation of our species is happening incrementally, through countless individual decisions made in pursuit of better health, competitive advantage, and enhanced capabilities.

> "Over the coming decades—probably a lot sooner than most people realize—the next great wave of technological change will wash over our lives. Its impact will be similar in sweep and rapidity to the advent of computers, cell phones, and the Web; but this time around, it is not our gadgets that will be transformed—it is we ourselves, our bodies, our minds."

**Quick Take**: The bioenhancement revolution is being driven by consumer choice, not just scientific innovation—once these technologies are available, many will find them too compelling to refuse.

### The Three Main Enhancement Technologies
Bess identifies three primary pathways through which human enhancement will occur: **pharmaceuticals** (neuroceuticals, life-extending drugs, cognitive enhancers), **bioelectronics** (cortical stimulation headsets, mood-regulating implants, brain-computer interfaces), and **genetics** (epigenetic modifications and germline engineering). Each technology category presents unique benefits and risks for individuals and society.

> "I could take a mood pill, of course, and feel fine within three or four minutes. Peaceful, clear, contented. But this is too important for that kind of composure."

**Quick Take**: These three technological tracks will converge to create unprecedented opportunities for human self-fashioning—but also new forms of dependency and vulnerability.

### Extended Longevity and Its Challenges
Medical advances will gradually lead to life expectancy of about 160 years, with healthy, vigorous living until approximately 145-150 years. This extended lifespan will transform family structures, careers, and social relationships, creating both opportunities for multigenerational connections and challenges regarding meaning, purpose, and resource allocation across longer lives.

> "I'm turning seventy this December, and I feel like I did when I was forty-five. Better, actually."

**Quick Take**: Extreme longevity will redefine every stage of life, requiring new social structures and personal approaches to finding meaning across centuries rather than decades.

### Social Justice and Biostratification
The unequal distribution of enhancement technologies threatens to create new forms of biological caste systems, dividing society into enhanced and unenhanced populations. This biostratification could exacerbate existing inequalities, creating unprecedented gaps in capabilities, opportunities, and life outcomes between those who can afford enhancements and those who cannot.

> "What do you want me to do, Dad? Bring everything to a halt? Have everyone else in their grade running circles around 'em?"

**Quick Take**: Without deliberate policy intervention, enhancement technologies could create biological hierarchies that make existing social inequalities seem trivial by comparison.

### The Coercive Nature of Enhancement
As enhancement technologies become normalized, social and professional pressure will increasingly force people to adopt them simply to remain competitive. This creates a cycle where "normal" continuously rises, compelling people into constant upgrades and modifications merely to keep up with changing baseline expectations.

> "They've nicknamed me Mr. Amish. That's what they're calling people like me these days. Amish grandpa. It's kind of like I'm a living window into the past."

**Quick Take**: Enhancement technologies may start as optional choices but quickly become necessary adaptations for maintaining social and economic viability.

## Best Quotes

- "They've nicknamed me Mr. Amish. That's what they're calling people like me these days. I smile, I shrug. My son, my grandkids—they're not being mean. They put their arm around my shoulders, squeezing gently, I can feel the affection. Amish grandpa. It's kind of like I'm a living window into the past."

- "Ever since Martha died, nineteen years ago, I stopped doing all the fancy pills and implants and epigenetic boosts. I kept the bioenhancements I had, and left it at that. No more upgrades, no more tweaks. I'd had enough."

- "I could take a mood pill, of course, and feel fine within three or four minutes. Peaceful, clear, contented. But this is too important for that kind of composure. I need to get a grip on myself and think this thing through."

- "People will live longer, healthier, more productive lives; they will connect with each other in seamless webs of direct interactivity; they will be able to fine-tune their own moods and thought processes; they will interact with machines in entirely new ways; their augmented minds will generate staggeringly complex and subtle forms of knowledge and insight."

- "Gradual reform, in short, is not just morally superior because of its generally nonviolent character: it is also more effective in the long run, engendering forms of enduring change that penetrate deeply into the fabric of society, altering hearts and minds as well as institutions."

## Policy Recommendations

- **Adopt the precautionary principle** in bioenhancement legislation: When suspected risks are catastrophic, err on the side of caution even with imperfect knowledge
- **Implement phased moratoriums** on radical enhancements, moving incrementally from modest to deeper modifications over decades or centuries
- **Mandate basic education** in Science, Technology, and Society (STS) to create informed citizens capable of making wise enhancement choices
- **Establish a global OTA-style institution** for coordinating technological innovation and regulation across national boundaries
- **Prioritize gradual reform** over revolutionary change, allowing social systems time to adapt to new technologies

## Questions to Consider

- How can we ensure equitable access to beneficial enhancement technologies without creating coercive social pressure to use them?
- What core human qualities should we protect from technological modification, regardless of potential benefits?
- How might extended lifespans transform our understanding of meaning, purpose, and human development across centuries rather than decades?
- When does enhancement become replacement rather than improvement—at what point do we stop being human?
- How can we maintain authenticity and genuine human connection in a world of technologically-mediated experiences and emotions?

## Conclusion
"Make Way for the Superhumans" is essential reading for anyone interested in the future of humanity. Bess masterfully balances technological optimism with ethical caution, presenting neither a utopian vision nor dystopian nightmare, but a complex, nuanced reality that will demand careful navigation. The book's greatest strength lies in its recognition that enhancement technologies offer both spectacular benefits and profound dangers—often simultaneously.

The biggest reason to read this book is its urgent relevance. These technologies are developing faster than our social and ethical frameworks, and Bess provides the conceptual tools we need to catch up. By framing enhancement as a series of choices rather than an inevitable destiny, he empowers readers to participate in shaping how these powerful technologies will transform our lives. Whether you embrace, resist, or carefully moderate human enhancement, this book provides the intellectual foundation for making informed decisions about our species' future.
