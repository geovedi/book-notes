## Introduction
- Apartment Hunting and Optimal Stopping
  - Apartment hunting in competitive cities like San Francisco is challenging due to limited listings and high demand.
  - The process involves quick decisions without much time for research or deliberation.
  - Balancing the need for information with the risk of missing out is a dilemma.
  - The 37% rule suggests spending 37% of the time exploring options before committing to the first better option encountered.
  - Optimal stopping is a concept from mathematics applied to solve such decision-making problems.
  - This approach applies to other scenarios like dating and various life decisions.
- Algorithms in Daily Life
  - Algorithms are sequences of steps to solve problems.
  - Algorithms were used by humans long before computers, like in cooking, knitting, and crafting.
  - Modern computer algorithms tackle complex real-world problems using chance, approximations, and trade-offs.
  - Applying computer science concepts to human life provides practical solutions and a deeper understanding of principles.
- Algorithmic Lens on Human Cognition
  - Behavioral economics often portrays humans as irrational and error-prone.
  - Computer science offers a different perspective on human cognition.
  - Many real-world problems are inherently difficult, and mistakes highlight the complexity of the problems rather than human shortcomings.
  - People often face challenges involving uncertainty, time constraints, and incomplete information.
  - Even if perfect algorithms don't exist for certain situations, insights from computer science can still guide decision-making.
- Living by Algorithmic Wisdom
  - Algorithms offer unconventional advice: not always considering all options, not always choosing the seemingly best outcome, making messes, and trusting instincts.
  - These principles challenge traditional notions of rationality.
  - Living by algorithmic wisdom is practical and backed by proofs.
- Interdisciplinary Nature of Algorithm Design
  - Algorithm design spans various fields such as computer science, mathematics, engineering, statistics, operations research, psychology, and economics.
  - Authors of the book come from diverse backgrounds: computer science, philosophy, psychology, and statistics.

- Real Estate and House Selling:
  - Selling a house involves optimal stopping decisions.
  - The goal is not necessarily to secure the best offer, but to maximize earnings through the process.
  - Waiting has a cost measured in dollars, and a good offer today may be better than a slightly better one later.
- Parking and Urban Planning:
  - Parking can be treated as an optimal stopping problem in urban planning.
  - Factors like parking supply, demand, and occupancy rate affect the search for parking spots.
  - Solutions involve adaptive pricing and finding the optimal balance between walking, searching, and cost.
- Quitting While Ahead and the "Burglar Problem":
  - The concept of quitting while ahead applies to various scenarios, including wealth accumulation and decision-making.
  - The "burglar problem" demonstrates the optimal number of sequential robberies to maximize expected gains.
- Human Decision-Making and Time Considerations:
  - Human decision-making often diverges from optimal strategies due to time considerations and impatience.
  - Endogenous time costs influence decision-making and can explain deviations from optimal solutions.
  - Time is a fundamental factor in decision-making, turning all choices into optimal stopping problems.
- Conclusion and Philosophical Implications:
  - Optimal stopping reflects the nature of life itself, where every decision point is unique and irrevocable.

  - Power-law distributions lead to "rich get richer" phenomena and have no natural scale.
  - Bayes's Rule is essential for making predictions based on limited evidence.
- Prediction Rules Based on Distributions
  - Power-law distribution uses the Multiplicative Rule: predict by multiplying observed data by a constant factor (e.g., movie grosses).
  - Normal distribution uses the Average Rule: predict based on the distribution's specific scale (e.g., human life spans).
  - Erlang distribution uses the Additive Rule: always predict a constant amount longer (e.g., radioactive decay intervals).
- Implications of Different Rules
  - Power-law events are more surprising the longer they are waited for; collapse of venerable entities is shocking.
  - Normal distribution's events are surprising when early, but expected when late.
  - Erlang distribution's events are equally likely to end regardless of duration.
- Human Prediction Behavior
  - People intuitively apply the right prediction rule based on the distribution of the domain.
  - Small data can yield accurate predictions due to rich priors and implicit understanding of distributions.
  - Good predictions require accurate priors; lack of familiarity leads to poor predictions.
- Psychological Aspects of Predictions
  - Delayed gratification tied to expectations more than just willpower (marshmallow test).
  - Individuals' priors can be influenced by their experiences and their environment's reliability.
  - Language and media skew perceptions of frequency, challenging accurate prior maintenance.
