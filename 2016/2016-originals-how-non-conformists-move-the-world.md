# Originals: How Non-Conformists Move the World
**Authors**: Adam Grant, Sheryl Sandberg | **Year**: 2016 | **Category**: Self-Help & Personal Development

## Summary
"Originals" shatters the myth that creativity and innovation are reserved for a select few. Adam Grant demonstrates that originality is not a fixed trait but a choice available to anyone willing to question defaults, champion novel ideas, and take calculated risks. The book reveals how successful non-conformists—from entrepreneurs to activists to artists—don't necessarily take bigger risks than others; they just manage them differently.

This groundbreaking work shows that child prodigies rarely change the world, ordinary people can achieve extraordinary things, and the most effective originals aren't reckless rebels but strategic thinkers who balance risk and conviction. Whether you're looking to innovate in your career, lead change in your organization, or raise creative children, this book provides the science-backed strategies to make your vision a reality.

Perfect for innovators, leaders, parents, and anyone who has ever wanted to challenge the status quo but didn't know where to start, "Originals" offers both inspiration and practical tools for becoming a creative force in your sphere of influence.

## Core Insights

### Question the Default
Originality begins with rejecting the notion that things must be the way they are. The hallmark of originality is questioning why defaults exist in the first place. This requires cultivating "vuja dé"—seeing familiar situations with fresh eyes that enable new insights into old problems.

When we accept defaults without question, we miss opportunities for improvement. The most successful originals don't accept that "if this were a good idea, someone would have done it already." Instead, they recognize that many systems and conventions were created by people and can therefore be improved by people.

> "The hallmark of originality is rejecting the default and exploring whether a better option exists."

**Quick Take**: Start your day by asking "Why?" about one routine or rule you follow without question.

### Balance Risk, Don't Avoid It
Counterintuitively, successful entrepreneurs and innovators tend to be more risk-averse than others. They achieve originality by balancing their risk portfolios—taking risks in one domain while being unusually cautious in others. Like the entrepreneurs who kept their day jobs while testing their ideas, they create safety nets that allow them to pursue bold visions without jeopardizing everything.

The founders of Warby Parker didn't quit school or rush into their eyewear business blindly. They tested their concept methodically, allowing them to pivot and refine their approach without betting the farm on an unproven idea.

> "Entrepreneurs who kept their day jobs had 33 percent lower odds of failure than those who quit."

**Quick Take**: When pursuing a risky project, create stability in another area of your life first.

### Generate More Ideas, Not Just Better Ones
Originality is a numbers game. The most creative innovators don't necessarily have better ideas—they have more ideas. Like baseball players who only get hits one out of three times at bat, originals swing and miss frequently but succeed through volume.

Research shows that the relationship between idea quantity and quality is positive: generating more ideas increases the chances of producing truly exceptional ones. Don't self-censor early in the creative process—let your imagination run wild and edit later.

> "The best way to boost your originality is to produce more ideas."

**Quick Take**: Set a goal to generate three times more ideas than you think you need for any project.

### Strategic Procrastination Can Boost Creativity
While chronic procrastination undermines success, strategic delays can enhance originality. When you stop work on an idea before it's complete, you give your mind time to engage in divergent thinking and let concepts incubate.

This creative pause allows you to approach problems from fresh angles and make unexpected connections. Many breakthrough ideas emerge during periods of incubation when the subconscious mind continues working on challenges.

**Quick Take**: When brainstorming, deliberately stop mid-stream and return to the project after a break of at least a few hours.

### Seek Peer Feedback, Not Just Expert Approval
It's difficult to evaluate your own ideas objectively, and managers tend to be overly critical when judging novel concepts. The most accurate assessments come from peers—people who understand your domain but aren't invested in the status quo.

Peers are better positioned to spot both potential and pitfalls in your ideas. They're close enough to understand the context but distant enough to provide objective feedback without the bias that comes from authority or ownership.

**Quick Take**: Before pitching to decision-makers, run your ideas by 3-5 trusted peers for honest feedback.

### Embrace Productive Dissent
The most innovative organizations don't just tolerate disagreement—they actively encourage it. But authentic dissent is more valuable than assigned devil's advocacy. Find people who genuinely hold minority opinions and invite them to share their perspectives.

When leaders model openness to criticism and demonstrate that challenging ideas is welcome, it creates psychological safety for others to speak up. This culture of constructive debate is essential for avoiding groupthink and fostering continuous innovation.

> "Dissenting opinions are useful even when they're wrong, but they're only effective if they're authentic and consistent."

**Quick Take**: In your next meeting, actively seek out the quietest person in the room and ask for their honest opinion.
