# Algorithms To Live By
**Authors**: Brian Christian, Tom Griffiths | **Year**: 2016 | **Category**: Technology & Computing

## Summary
"Algorithms To Live By" reveals how computer science can provide practical wisdom for everyday human decisions. The authors demonstrate that many of life's toughest decisions—from when to stop searching for an apartment to how to balance trying new restaurants versus enjoying old favorites—are actually computational problems that have been studied for decades. What makes this book profound is its revelation that the best algorithms aren't about finding perfect solutions through exhaustive analysis, but about making smart tradeoffs given limited time, information, and cognitive resources.

The book translates eleven fundamental computer science concepts into actionable life strategies, showing that being rational doesn't mean choosing the optimal option every time, but rather using the right process for the right problem. It's essential reading for anyone who wants to make better decisions while understanding that sometimes "good enough" is truly the smartest approach.

## Core Insights

### Optimal Stopping: The 37% Rule
**The Challenge**: When should you stop looking and commit? Whether dating apartment hunting, or parking, you face a tradeoff between gathering more information and potentially missing your best option.

**The Solution**: Look at the first 37% of options without committing, then choose the next option that's better than everything you've seen so far. This gives you the highest probability (37%) of selecting the best option.

> "The 37% Rule defines a simple series of steps—what computer scientists call an 'algorithm'—for solving these problems."

**Quick Take**: When apartment hunting, spend the first 11 days of a month-long search just looking, then be ready to commit to the first place that beats everything you've seen.

### Explore/Exploit: The Latest vs. The Greatest
**The Challenge**: Should you try that new restaurant or go to your favorite? This fundamental tradeoff between gathering new information and using what you already know shapes everything from career decisions to dinner plans.

**The Solution**: Your strategy should depend on your time horizon. Explore heavily early on, then shift toward exploitation as time runs short. The interval makes the strategy.

> "The value of exploration, of finding a new favorite, can only go down over time, as the remaining opportunities to savor it dwindle."

**Quick Take**: When you've just moved to a city, try everywhere. When you're about to leave, stick to your proven favorites.

### Sorting: Making Order Efficiently
**The Challenge**: From organizing books to structuring tournaments, sorting is essential but expensive in terms of time and effort.

**The Solution**: Use the right algorithm for the situation. Bubble sort is simple but slow (O(n²)), while merge sort is much faster (O(n log n)). Sometimes "messy" organizations are actually more efficient.

> "Sorting theory tells us how (and whether) to arrange our offices."

**Quick Take**: Don't over-organize low-value items. A partially sorted system often delivers most of the benefits with far less effort.

### Caching: Managing Limited Space
**The Challenge**: Our brains, closets, and schedules have limited space. What should we keep readily accessible versus store away?

**The Solution**: Use the "Least Recently Used" principle - evict items that haven't been used for the longest time. This approximates the optimal strategy for most real-world scenarios.

**Quick Take**: Keep frequently used items easily accessible, but don't be afraid to remove things you haven't needed recently.

### Scheduling: The Taming of Time
**The Challenge**: How should we order our tasks when some depend on others and deadlines loom?

**The Solution**: Use Moore's Algorithm for deadlines: drop the task with the longest completion time when you can't meet all deadlines. For task ordering, use "shortest processing time first" to minimize total completion time.

**Quick Take**: If you're running behind on multiple projects, sometimes dropping the longest task is better than finishing everything late.

### Bayes's Rule: Predicting with Uncertainty
**The Challenge**: How should we update our beliefs when faced with new information?

**The Solution**: Start with prior beliefs, then update them based on new evidence using Bayesian inference. The strength of your prior should depend on your existing knowledge.

> "More than 250 years ago, the question of making predictions from small data weighed heavily on the mind of the Reverend Thomas Bayes."

**Quick Take**: Don't overreact to small amounts of new information. Let strong prior beliefs moderate your reactions to limited evidence.

### Overfitting: The Perils of Too Much Complexity
**The Challenge**: When does collecting more data or creating more complex rules actually make things worse?

**The Solution**: Prefer simpler models and solutions. Adding complexity always improves fit to past data but often reduces future performance. Less is usually more.

**Quick Take**: If a theory or explanation seems too perfectly tailored to past events, it's probably overfit and won't predict the future well.

### Relaxation: The Power of Good Enough
**The Challenge**: Some problems are computationally intractable - finding the perfect solution would take forever.

**The Solution**: Relax constraints and accept "good enough" solutions. Use approximations, heuristics, and randomness to find workable answers quickly.

**Quick Take**: When facing impossible decisions, focus on finding a satisfactory solution rather than the optimal one.

### Randomness: When Order Fails
**The Challenge**: Sometimes structured approaches perform worse than random choices.

**The Solution**: Strategic randomness can outperform deterministic algorithms in certain situations, from sampling to optimization.

**Quick Take**: When stuck in decision-making paralysis, sometimes flipping a coin is genuinely the best approach.

### Networking: The Power of Connection
**The Challenge**: How do information and influence spread through networks?

**The Solution**: Understand that networks have emergent properties. Small changes in network structure can create massive changes in behavior and outcomes.

**Quick Take**: Your position in networks matters as much as your individual capabilities.

### Game Theory: When Others' Choices Matter
**The Challenge**: How should you act when your outcomes depend on others' decisions?

**The Solution**: Consider others' incentives and look for equilibrium points. Sometimes the best strategy involves cooperation rather than pure self-interest.

> "Even where perfect algorithms haven't been found, the battle between generations of computer scientists and the most intractable real-world problems has yielded a series of insights."

**Quick Take**: Think about what others want and how they think you'll act. The best move often accounts for others' best moves.

## Best Quotes
- "Living by the wisdom of computer science doesn't sound so bad after all. And unlike most advice, it's backed up by proofs."
- "The mistakes made by people often say more about the intrinsic difficulties of the problem than about the fallibility of human brains."
- "Every harried renter, driver, and suitor you see around you as you go through a typical week is essentially reinventing the wheel."
- "In the hard cases, the best algorithms are all about doing what makes the most sense in the least amount of time."
- "These aren't the concessions we make when we can't be rational. They're what being rational means."

## Action Items
- Apply the 37% Rule to your next significant search (job, apartment, relationship)
- Balance exploration and exploitation based on your time horizon
- Use "least recently used" to declutter your space and schedule
- Prioritize shorter tasks to reduce your total completion time
- Start with strong prior beliefs, but update them based on meaningful evidence
- Prefer simpler solutions over complex ones
- Use "good enough" solutions for intractable problems
- Be strategically random when stuck
- Consider your network position in decisions
- Think about others' incentives in strategic situations

## Questions to Consider
- In what areas of life are you over-exploring when you should be exploiting?
- Which problems are you trying to solve perfectly when "good enough" would suffice?
- How can you use the 37% Rule in your current decision-making?
- Where are you overfitting your models of people and situations?
- How can you apply computational kindness in your interactions?

## Conclusion
"Algorithms To Live By" is revolutionary not because it offers perfect solutions, but because it provides permission to be imperfectly rational. It reveals that many of our "decision-making failures" are actually appropriate responses to genuinely hard problems. The book's greatest insight is that rationality isn't about optimization—it's about using the right computational approach for each problem's inherent difficulty.

This is essential reading for anyone who feels paralyzed by choice or overwhelmed by complexity. You'll finish with practical tools for better decisions and, more importantly, with compassion for yourself when even the best algorithms don't guarantee success. The book demonstrates that the wisdom of computer science isn't cold or mechanical—it's profoundly humane in its acceptance of constraints and its focus on processes over outcomes.

Read this if you want to make better decisions with less stress. Skip it if you're looking for a magic formula that always yields perfect results—because as the authors demonstrate, such formulas don't exist in the complex problems that actually matter.
