## Core Insights

> "Hillbillies learn from an early age to deal with uncomfortable truths by avoiding them, or by pretending better truths exist."

> "The Marine Corps excised that feeling like a surgeon does a tumor."

**Quick Take**: Sometimes the most valuable gift you can give someone struggling is clear expectations and consistent structure.

### The Persistence of Childhood Trauma
Even after achieving professional success, Vance continues to battle the emotional patterns and responses learned during his difficult childhood, showing how early experiences shape us permanently.

> "For those of us lucky enough to live the American Dream, the demons of the life we left behind continue to chase us."
