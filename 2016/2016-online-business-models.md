## Core Insights

### 🔗 Affiliate Marketing
The most direct path to online income through promoting other people's products. You earn commissions by driving traffic and sales to businesses through specialized tracking links.

**How it works**: Join affiliate networks like Hydra Network, select products to promote, and use advertising platforms like Google AdWords to reach potential customers. You can earn through Pay Per Click (PPC) or Pay Per Sale (PPS) models.

**Quick Start**: Sign up for affiliate networks, choose products you genuinely understand, and start with small advertising budgets to test what converts.

### 🎯 Niche Content Sites
Build authority websites focused on specific interests or problems. The narrower your niche, the more targeted (and valuable) your audience becomes.

**Strategy**: Research profitable niches using Google Suggest, create at least 50 pages of quality content optimized with relevant keywords, then monetize through affiliate products or advertising.

> "The narrower you are making your niche, the lesser is the number of people you are getting for your site, but at the same time, these people are more focused and they will be more interested in doing business with you."

**Quick Start**: Choose a niche you're passionate about, research keyword demand, and create comprehensive content that solves specific problems for your target audience.
