# Now: The Physics of Time
**Authors**: Richard A. Muller | **Year**: 2016 | **Category**: Science & Nature

## Summary
Richard A. Muller, an experimental physicist who helped discover dark energy, tackles one of physics' deepest mysteries: What is "now" and why does time appear to flow? This revolutionary book argues that "now" is not just a psychological illusion but a physical reality—the continuously created forefront of time itself. Muller overturns century-old assumptions about entropy and time's arrow, presenting a bold 4D Big Bang theory that explains why we experience time's forward motion and how free will fits within physics.

This book is perfect for curious readers fascinated by time, physics enthusiasts, and anyone who has wondered about the nature of reality. You'll gain a profound new understanding of how time works, why the universe evolves forward, and what this means for human free will and consciousness.

## Core Insights

### The 4D Big Bang Creates Time Continuously
Muller's revolutionary theory reframes the Big Bang as a 4D explosion that continuously creates both space AND time. While we've long understood that space expands, Muller argues time is also being generated at the universe's frontier. The "now" we experience is literally the leading edge of this ongoing 4D expansion—the boundary between what has already happened and what is being newly created.

> "As the Big Bang creates new space, it also creates new time... and that new time is the key to now."

**Why This Matters**: This solves the ancient paradox of why "now" feels special and why time appears to flow. We're not just experiencing psychological time—we're experiencing the physical creation of new moments as the universe expands. The flow of time is real, not illusory.

### Time Flow Causes Entropy Increase (Not the Reverse)
Muller overturns the conventional wisdom from physicist Arthur Eddington (1928) that entropy increase drives time's arrow. Instead, he argues this is backward: the flow of time causes entropy to increase, not the other way around. This has profound implications for how we understand order, life, and civilization.

> "Take a cup of hot coffee and let it stand in a cool room. As heat leaves the coffee, the entropy of the coffee decreases, but the entropy of the room increases more than enough to make up for it. By just putting the coffee aside to cool, you are responsible for purposefully increasing the entropy of the universe, something that can never be undone."

**Why This Matters**: If entropy doesn't drive time, then we have more agency than previously believed. Life and civilization depend on local entropy decrease (organization, complexity, knowledge), not entropy increase. We can exercise meaningful control over entropy pathways to build and sustain civilization.

### Relativity Reveals Time's Flexible Nature
Einstein's relativity demonstrates that time is not absolute but flexible—stretching, slowing, and even reversing under different conditions. This mathematical framework provides essential structure for understanding how "now" can be both universal and relative, and how the 4D Big Bang creates time consistently across reference frames.

> "Live upstairs and your life will move ahead faster." Time flows faster at higher altitudes where gravity is weaker.

**Why This Matters**: Relativity shows time's behavior is stranger than intuition suggests, yet follows precise mathematical laws. GPS satellites must account for time dilation—they experience time differently than we do on Earth's surface. Understanding this helps grasp how the 4D Big Bang could consistently create time across the universe.

### Quantum Physics Breaks Determinism and Enables Free Will
Quantum mechanics, with its verified "spooky action at a distance" (entanglement), demonstrates that the future is not completely determined by the past. This breaks strict determinism and creates space for genuine free will to exist within physics.

> "A most liberating consequence of quantum physics is that the past no longer determines the future, at least not completely."

**Why This Matters**: Free will isn't incompatible with physics—it's enabled by it. The existence of free will could only be falsified if we discovered faster-than-light tachyons (which would allow perfect prediction and control). Since none have been found, free will remains scientifically viable and essential for understanding our role in the universe's evolution.

### "Now" Is the Moment of Choice and Influence
The continuously created "now" represents the moment when we can exercise free will to affect the future. While past moments are fixed, the new moment being created by the 4D Big Bang allows us to make choices that influence entropy flow and shape future states.

> "Free will is the ability to use nonphysics knowledge to make decisions... It doesn't stop the increase of entropy, but it can exercise control over accessible states, and that gives entropy direction."

**Why This Matters**: This bridges physics and human agency. We're not just passive observers of time's flow—we're active participants who can use knowledge (including empathy, ethics, and wisdom) to guide how entropy unfolds, potentially strengthening civilization rather than destroying it.

## Best Quotes
- "Now—that enigmatic and ephemeral moment that changes its meaning every instant—has confounded priests, philosophers, and physicists, and with good reason."
- "What does move, what does flow, is the meaning of now. Now is progressing, changing, advancing through time."
- "Physics is not simple and linear... This story can also be thought of as a mystery, with a gradual accumulation of clues leading to a remarkable resolution."
- "The existence of free will could be falsified if we found faster-than-light tachyons... I think that I have free will."
- "The denial of nonphysics, nonmath truths has been named physicalism by philosophers. Physicalism is faith based and has all the trappings of a religion itself."

## Key Takeaways
- **Time is real and flows**: The flow of time is not an illusion but the physical creation of new moments by the 4D Big Bang
- **"Now" is the frontier**: Your present moment is the leading edge of time being continuously created by the expanding universe
- **Free will is physics-compatible**: Quantum mechanics breaks strict determinism, creating space for genuine choice
- **We influence entropy**: Civilization depends on directing entropy flow toward organization and complexity, not just accepting inevitable disorder
- **Physics is incomplete**: Reality extends beyond physics and mathematics to include consciousness, values, and meaning

## Questions to Consider
- If "now" is continuously being created, what does this mean for the nature of consciousness and experience?
- How might understanding that time flow causes entropy (not vice versa) change how we approach problems and decisions?
- What are the ethical implications of having free will in a universe where we can influence entropy flow?
- If physics cannot describe all of reality, what other ways of knowing complement scientific understanding?
- How does the 4D Big Bang theory reshape our understanding of our place in the universe?

## Conclusion
**This book is absolutely worth your time** if you're fascinated by the deepest questions of reality, time, and consciousness. Muller's revolutionary 4D Big Bang theory provides the most compelling explanation yet for why time flows and what "now" actually means. The biggest reason to read this book is its profound synthesis: it brings together relativity, quantum mechanics, thermodynamics, and cosmology into a unified picture that makes sense of time's flow and human free will.

What makes this book exceptional is that it's written by an experimental physicist who helped discover dark energy—not by a philosopher speculating about physics. Muller combines cutting-edge scientific understanding with clear, accessible explanations and profound philosophical implications. By the end, you'll never think about "now" the same way again, and you'll have a scientifically grounded understanding of how your choices fit into the universe's evolution. This isn't just a book about physics—it's about what it means to be human in a universe where time is continuously being created.
