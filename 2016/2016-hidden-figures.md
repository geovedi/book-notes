# Hidden Figures
**Author**: Margot Lee Shetterly | **Year**: 2016 | **Category**: History & Biography

## Summary
Hidden Figures tells the remarkable true story of the African American female mathematicians who served as the "human computers" at NASA's Langley Research Center from the 1940s through the 1960s. These brilliant women—Dorothy Vaughan, Katherine Johnson, Mary Jackson, and their colleagues—were the mathematical brains behind America's greatest achievements in space, from John Glenn's orbital flight to the Apollo moon landing, all while navigating the harsh realities of segregation and gender discrimination in the Jim Crow South.

The book reveals how these women, armed with exceptional mathematical talent and unwavering determination, broke through racial and gender barriers to become indispensable contributors to the space race. Their story demonstrates how excellence can transcend prejudice, and how the "hidden figures" who worked behind the scenes were often the real heroes of America's technological triumphs.

**Who should read this**: Anyone interested in space exploration, civil rights history, women's achievements in STEM, or inspiring stories of unsung heroes will find this book captivating. Readers will gain a deeper appreciation for the diverse contributions that made America's space program possible and understand how perseverance against discrimination led to groundbreaking scientific achievements.

## Core Insights

### The Double Victory Campaign
The entry of black women into NASA's war effort was made possible by A. Philip Randolph's fight for economic equality alongside civil rights. Executive Order 8802, desegregating the defense industry, opened doors that had been closed since Reconstruction. These women weren't just fighting for personal advancement—they were fighting for a "double V" victory: victory against fascism abroad and racism at home.

> "Twenty years in the future, Randolph would address the multitudes at another March on Washington, then concede the stage to a young, charismatic minister from Atlanta named Martin Luther King Jr."

**Quick Take**: Economic opportunity and civil rights progress are often intertwined; opening professional doors to marginalized groups benefits everyone's goals.

### Excellence as the Ultimate Equalizer
At Langley, mathematical ability became the great leveler. Engineers who initially harbored prejudice came to respect and rely on these women for their indispensable calculations. The women's consistent accuracy and problem-solving skills earned them trust and gradually broke down racial barriers within the workplace.

> "Many of the engineers were Northerners, relatively agnostic on the racial issue but devout when it came to mathematical talent."

**Quick Take**: When competence is undeniable and essential to success, prejudice often gives way to respect and collaboration.

### The Power of Quiet Defiance
The small acts of resistance—like Miriam Mann repeatedly removing the "Colored Computers" sign from the cafeteria table—were catalysts for change. These everyday protests, though seemingly minor, challenged the system and paved the way for greater integration and equality.

> "Then they're just going to have to do it," she would retort when her husband warned she might be fired over the sign removal.

**Quick Take**: Small, consistent acts of courage can be more powerful than dramatic gestures; they chip away at unjust systems until they collapse.

### Community as Survival Strategy
The West Computers created their own support system through shared backgrounds at black colleges, Greek letter organizations, and church connections. This network provided emotional support, professional development, and collective strength that helped them thrive in a hostile environment.

> "By securing jobs in Langley's West Computing section, they now had pledged one of the most exclusive sororities in the world."

**Quick Take**: Building strong community networks is essential for navigating challenging environments and creating pathways for others to follow.

### The Mathematics of Freedom
These women understood that mathematical proficiency wasn't just a career—it was liberation. In an era when opportunities for black women were severely limited, mathematics offered a meritocratic field where their abilities could speak for themselves and provide economic independence.

> "In 1940, just 2 percent of all black women earned college degrees, and 60 percent of those women became teachers, mostly in public elementary and high schools. Exactly zero percent of those 1940 college graduates became engineers."

**Quick Take**: Technical skills and education can be powerful tools for economic freedom and social mobility, especially for marginalized groups.

## Best Quotes
- "They were answering the call of President Roosevelt, who had challenged Americans to build 'the arsenal of democracy' in the face of global fascism."
- "For most of its existence a small and contained operation, the NACA's flagship laboratory was now a many-layered bureaucracy flush with new faces."
- "This war is being fought in the laboratories as well as on the battlefields."
- "The front door to the laboratory was open, but many others remained closed."
- "There was no way that Randolph, or the men at the laboratory, or anyone else could have predicted that the hiring of a group of black female mathematicians at the Langley Memorial Aeronautical Laboratory would end at the Moon."

## Action Items
- **Recognize hidden talent**: Look beyond surface characteristics to identify exceptional ability in unexpected places
- **Create inclusive environments**: Actively remove barriers that prevent qualified people from contributing their full potential
- **Stand up against everyday discrimination**: Challenge small injustices before they become entrenched
- **Build support networks**: Foster communities that help marginalized individuals thrive
- **Value different perspectives**: Diverse teams often produce better solutions than homogenous ones

## Questions to Consider
- How many "hidden figures" are working in your organization today, whose contributions go unrecognized?
- What barriers still exist that prevent talented people from reaching their full potential?
- How can we ensure that merit, not background, determines success in STEM fields?
- What role did economic necessity play in breaking down racial barriers, and what does this teach us about creating opportunity?
- How can we honor the contributions of those who work behind the scenes to make great achievements possible?

## Conclusion
Hidden Figures is essential reading because it reminds us that America's greatest achievements were built on the contributions of diverse individuals who often worked in obscurity. The story of these remarkable women demonstrates that talent knows no color or gender, and that when given opportunity, brilliant minds can transform the world.

This book is worth your time because it does more than celebrate unsung heroes—it provides a powerful blueprint for how organizations and societies can unlock human potential by removing artificial barriers. In an era when we're still working to ensure equal access to STEM fields and combat workplace discrimination, the lessons from Langley's West Computing section are more relevant than ever.

The biggest reason to read this book is that it will change how you see history, technology, and possibility. You'll never again think about the space race without remembering the black women who made it possible, and you'll understand that the next great breakthroughs will come from recognizing and nurturing talent wherever it exists.
