# Optimize Your Productivity
**Authors**: Lisa Kardos, Ph.D. | **Year**: 2016 | **Category**: Self-Help & Personal Development

## Summary
"Optimize Your Productivity" presents a counterintuitive approach to productivity that applies simple engineering principles to personal effectiveness. Rather than forcing a one-size-fits-all system, Dr. Kardos introduces a framework that treats you as a system to optimize—accounting for your unique attributes, preferences, and circumstances. The book defines productivity as "personally accomplishing required (or desired) tasks; or ensuring that identified tasks get accomplished, even if not done personally—in the least amount of time possible."

This guide is perfect for busy professionals, students, and anyone feeling overwhelmed by traditional productivity systems. You'll learn to work with your natural tendencies instead of against them, creating a sustainable approach that increases your output while reducing stress.

## Core Insights

### The Engineering Framework
The book's unique approach treats productivity as an engineering system with seven key inputs that determine your output. Instead of focusing on willpower or forcing rigid systems, you optimize these inputs based on your personal traits and circumstances. This framework allows for customization while maintaining scientific reliability.

> "Productivity is more than the definition described in the introduction; it is also a feeling. If you feel productive, you feel that you're in control. Feeling in control is one of the keys to mastering your productivity."

**Quick Take**: Stop trying to force-fit others' productivity systems and instead optimize your personal productivity inputs.

### The Seven Productivity Inputs

#### 1. Driving Factor (Your "Why")
Your driving factor serves as both motivation and a fail-safe system when life gets difficult. Without a compelling reason to be productive, you'll revert to survival mode, especially during challenging times.

> "Having a strong driving factor for our lives gives us purpose, sustains us, and it serves as the foundation for our productivity in life and business."

**Quick Take**: Identify and regularly reconnect with your core motivation for wanting to be more productive.

#### 2. Energy Management
Energy is the foundation of productivity—if you're exhausted, you can't convert effort into results. The book emphasizes that many people underestimate how fatigue affects focus, clarity, and efficiency.

> "If we are completely exhausted, where we are suffering in our health and energy, then we're not in a position to convert that energy into productive 'work'."

**Quick Take**: Prioritize sleep, nutrition, and energy management as essential productivity components, not afterthoughts.

#### 3. Neuroscience Considerations
Working with your brain's natural rhythms rather than against them dramatically improves effectiveness. This includes understanding your optimal work times, attention spans, and mental energy patterns.

**Quick Take**: Schedule your most important tasks during your peak mental performance periods.

#### 4. Anticipatory Thinking
Strategic thinking about your time allows you to make progress on long-term goals through small, consistent actions rather than waiting for perfect conditions.

**Quick Take**: Use compound effect thinking—small actions today create significant results over time.

#### 5. Time and Efficiency Management
True time management is actually self-management. You can't control time, but you can control how efficiently you use it by managing yourself effectively.

**Quick Take**: Focus on managing your energy and attention rather than trying to manage time itself.

#### 6. Goal Setting
The book advocates a hybrid approach to goal setting that avoids the pitfalls of traditional methods while providing direction and focus for daily actions.

**Quick Take**: Use goals as guideposts rather than rigid mandates, allowing flexibility while maintaining direction.

#### 7. Prioritization
The order in which you conduct tasks significantly impacts productivity. Effective prioritization integrates all other inputs—energy, neuroscience, goals, and personal preferences.

**Quick Take**: Prioritize based on your unique combination of energy levels, mental clarity, and importance, not just urgency.

### Self-Awareness as the Key
The book emphasizes that self-awareness and self-compassion are crucial for productivity optimization. Understanding your personal patterns, energy cycles, and working style allows you to customize the framework effectively.

> "Knowing and accepting yourself is extremely important. Once you know yourself, you can figure out how to optimize your productivity given the factors we mentioned earlier."

**Quick Take**: Track your personal patterns to identify your optimal working conditions and customize accordingly.

## Best Quotes

- "Productivity optimization is not necessarily linear. There may be instances where we have to invest more of our time and energy upfront to reap the rewards later."
- "Feeling in control is one of the keys to mastering your productivity."
- "While many books often take the approach of offering many anecdotes to illustrate a point, I take a more streamlined approach in this book. The assumption is that you're looking to become more productive and efficient – and most likely need the time for other things in your life."
- "Each time you choose to work on something, you are not working on something else."
- "We can have the best of both worlds – a reliable system to improve your productivity, without sacrificing or 'shocking' your system, since drastic changes are often unsustainable in self-improvement."

## Action Items

- **Start pattern tracking**: Use the provided worksheets to track your energy, clarity, and efficiency patterns throughout the day

## Conclusion
"Optimize Your Productivity" is worth your time if you've struggled with traditional productivity systems or feel overwhelmed by one-size-fits-all approaches. The book's greatest strength is its engineering framework that treats you as a unique system to optimize rather than a problem to fix. By focusing on seven key inputs and encouraging self-awareness, it provides a sustainable path to increased productivity without the guilt or burnout common in other approaches.

The biggest reason to read this book is its emphasis on working with your natural tendencies rather than against them.
