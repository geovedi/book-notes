# Rise of the Rocket Girls
**Original Title**: Rise of the Rocket Girls: The Women Who Propelled Us, from Missiles to the Moon to Mars
**Authors**: Nathalia Holt | **Year**: 2016

## Summary
"Rise of the Rocket Girls" tells the fascinating untold story of the brilliant women mathematicians who formed the computational backbone of NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) from the 1940s through the Space Race era. These "human computers" performed complex mathematical calculations by hand that enabled America's first satellite launches, planetary explorations, and ultimately the moon landing. The book follows pioneers like Macie Roberts, Barbara Paulson, Helen Ling, and Sue Finley as they evolved from human calculators to becoming some of the first computer programmers and female engineers in rocket science.

This inspiring narrative reveals how JPL became an unlikely hub for women with exceptional math and science abilities during an era when their career options were typically limited to teaching, nursing, or secretarial work. Through perseverance, technical brilliance, and supportive mentorship, these women not only broke gender barriers but also made crucial contributions to landmark achievements including the Explorer satellite, the Deep Space Network, Voyager missions, and Mars exploration.

Perfect for history enthusiasts, science lovers, and anyone seeking inspiring stories of unsung heroes who shaped modern space exploration, this book offers a powerful reminder of the essential role women played in America's greatest technological triumphs.

## The Journey Through Time

### The Founding Years (1940s)
During World War II, JPL emerged from a group of Caltech students known as the "Suicide Squad" who experimented with dangerous rocket propulsion. Barby Canright became JPL's first female computer, joining the experimental team that developed America's first rocket-powered airplane. The military funding that kept JPL alive during wartime created the foundation for future space exploration.

**Key turning point**: When Macie Roberts became supervisor of the computer department and made the revolutionary decision to hire only women, creating a supportive female-driven environment that would nurture generations of talent.

### The Space Race Begins (1950s)
As the Cold War intensified, JPL shifted from missiles to space exploration. The launch of Sputnik in 1957 created urgent pressure to succeed. The women computers calculated trajectories for Jupiter-C rockets that could have beaten Sputnik to orbit, and ultimately determined the success of Explorer 1, America's first satellite, in January 1958.

**Memorable moment**: An anonymous female computer waited sixteen agonizing hours to confirm that Explorer 1 had successfully reached orbit, making her calculations the difference between triumph and disaster in the Space Race.

### Planetary Exploration (1960s-1970s)
JPL's ambitions expanded to the planets with the Ranger and Mariner missions. The women adapted to new IBM computers, learning FORTRAN programming while still performing crucial calculations that the machines couldn't handle. They balanced growing families and advancing careers despite being fired for pregnancy and facing daily gender discrimination.

**Technical breakthrough**: Helen Chow and her team developed trajectory calculations that enabled Voyager's Grand Tour, while Sue Finley became an expert at programming the Deep Space Network to track signals across billions of miles.

## Core Insights

### The Power of Women-Only Spaces
Macie Roberts' policy of hiring only women created an environment of mutual support and mentorship that enabled female mathematicians to thrive in a male-dominated field. This "sorority of scientists" provided both technical collaboration and emotional support that helped women overcome institutional barriers.

> "You're professional women."
> —Macie Roberts, reminding her team to take themselves seriously in the face of sexism

**Quick Take**: Sometimes the best way to break barriers is to create spaces where underrepresented groups can develop strength and confidence together.

### From Human to Machine Computing
The transition from manual calculations to computer programming didn't make these women obsolete—it made them invaluable. As the first to master early IBMs and FORTRAN programming, they became essential bridges between traditional mathematics and emerging computer science, a role many male engineers initially resisted.

> "Engineers make up the problems and we solve them."
> —Helen Chow, describing the computers' relationship with engineers

**Quick Take**: Adaptation to new technology is crucial for career longevity, especially when you can translate between old and new methods.

### Persistence Through Discrimination
These women faced constant sexism: being fired for pregnancy, passed over for promotions, and expected to quit after marriage. Yet many returned after having children, pursued advanced degrees, and eventually earned recognition as engineers. Their perseverance helped change JPL's culture over decades.

> "In this job you need to look like a girl, act like a lady, think like a man, and work like a dog."
> —Macie Roberts' advice to new hires

**Quick Take**: Success in hostile environments requires both exceptional performance and the courage to demand recognition for your contributions.

## Key Takeaways

- Women performed the essential mathematical calculations that enabled every major American space achievement from 1940s-1970s
- JPL's policy of hiring female computers created an unexpected pipeline of female engineering talent
- The transition from human to machine computers required adaptation but created new opportunities for women in technology
- Persistence in the face of discrimination gradually changed institutional culture and created opportunities for future generations
- Many barriers remain—today fewer women graduate with computer science degrees than in the 1980s

## Questions to Consider

How many other essential contributions to science and technology have been overlooked due to gender or racial bias? What "human computer" roles exist in today's AI and data science fields that might be historically significant? How can we create more environments like Macie Roberts' computer department that nurture underrepresented talent in STEM fields?

## Conclusion
"Rise of the Rocket Girls" is worth your time as a powerful reminder that history's greatest achievements often depended on unseen contributors working behind the scenes. The biggest reason to read it is to understand how institutional barriers can be overcome through persistence, mentorship, and exceptional talent. These women's story isn't just about space exploration—it's about how groups of dedicated individuals can change both technology and culture, creating opportunities that didn't exist before they proved what was possible. Their legacy continues at JPL today, where more women work than at any other NASA facility, still building on the foundation these remarkable women established.
