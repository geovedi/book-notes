Author: Angela Duckworth

## What Grit Is and Why It Matters

### Showing Up
- Rigorous Challenges of West Point and Beyond
  - The admissions process for the United States Military Academy at West Point is highly demanding, comparable to that of the most selective universities.
  - Applicants need top SAT/ACT scores, excellent high school grades, and nomination from a member of Congress or other high-ranking officials.
  - The intense Beast Barracks training program, designed to transition new cadets into soldiers, is both physically and emotionally challenging.
  - While many start, only a fraction, around 1,200 out of 14,000 applicants, graduate from West Point due to the strenuous demands.
  - Remarkably, one in five cadets drops out, with a substantial portion leaving during the rigorous initial summer training.
- The Concept of Grit and Its Importance
  - Grit, described as a combination of passion and perseverance, emerges as a crucial factor in determining success across various domains.
  - The Grit Scale, a test designed to measure grit, focuses on qualities like overcoming setbacks, finishing tasks, and enduring challenges.
  - Research conducted at West Point, in sales professions, and within education shows that grit reliably predicts who succeeds and who drops out.
  - Grittier individuals tend to persevere, consistently working hard and maintaining a strong sense of direction despite setbacks and challenges.
- Grit vs. Talent
  - Grit and talent are distinct qualities, with grit often prevailing over talent in determining success in demanding situations.
  - Angela's research revealed that at West Point, the highest Whole Candidate Scores did not ensure success, as both high and low scorers dropped out.
  - Grit was found to be an even more reliable predictor of success in comparison to other traits like intelligence, extroversion, emotional stability, and conscientiousness.
  - The concept of grit extends beyond West Point, affecting success in fields such as sales, education, and the military, as well as being present in various personal pursuits.

### Distracted by Talent
- The Paradox of Talent: McKinsey and the Pursuit of Excellence
  - McKinsey, a renowned consulting firm, prizes talent above all else and relies heavily on SAT scores for candidate selection.
  - A group of new hires with diverse academic backgrounds undergoes an intensive "mini-MBA" crash course to become problem-solving consultants.
  - McKinsey's approach emphasizes hiring the best and brightest, but this fixation on talent doesn't always translate to success, as exemplified by Enron's downfall.
- The Harm of Talent Obsession: The Case for Grit and Effort
  - Focusing solely on talent can undermine other crucial attributes like grit and determination.
  - Scott Barry Kaufman's journey from being labeled a slow learner to discovering his potential illustrates the power of effort and determination.
  - The negative consequences of segregating "gifted" and "non-gifted" individuals from an early age and relying solely on IQ scores are evident.
- Shifting the Focus: Talent vs. Effort
  - The stories of Scott and Angela's personal experiences demonstrate the flaws in measuring and valuing talent.
  - Tests of talent and grit, though imperfect, should not overshadow the significance of effort.
  - The need to reevaluate the emphasis on talent and acknowledge that effort plays a pivotal role in personal and professional growth.

### Effort Counts Twice
- The Illusion of Natural Talent
  - The prevalence of the term "talent" is evident in various areas, from sports to business and the arts, leading to a tendency to overemphasize talent and neglect other factors that contribute to success.
  - A study of competitive swimmers reveals that exceptional performance is an amalgamation of ordinary skills honed through consistent practice, and attributing it solely to talent oversimplifies the process.
  - The notion of talent persists because it provides a convenient explanation for exceptional achievements when we can't comprehend the underlying hard work and training.
- The Power of Effort and Mastery
  - The story of various accomplished individuals, like potter Warren MacKenzie, writer John Irving, and entertainer Will Smith, highlights the significance of effort in achieving greatness.
  - Mastery and skill are not solely reliant on innate talent but rather the result of sustained effort and dedicated practice, challenging the assumption that talent alone guarantees success.
  - George Vaillant's long-term study on the correlation between physical effort and psychological adjustment underscores the value of perseverance and grit in life achievements.
- Consistency, Commitment, and the Path to Success
  - The concept of consistently returning to the metaphorical treadmill—persistently working toward a goal—demonstrates genuine grit and determination to overcome challenges.
  - While natural talent can set the stage, true accomplishment arises from turning that potential into skill through relentless effort, resulting in a productive outcome.
  - The separation of talent and skill highlights the importance of hours spent honing one's craft; skill, in conjunction with effort, transforms into meaningful achievement, revealing that both innate talent and hard work are essential components of success.

### How Gritty Are You?
- The Importance of Grit and Goal Hierarchy
  - Grit, defined as perseverance and passion for long-term goals, is not about stubbornly pursuing every low-level goal at all costs. Instead, it involves organizing goals in a hierarchy and knowing when to abandon certain endeavors that don't contribute to higher objectives.
  - Rejection is a common part of the journey to achieving goals. For instance, renowned New Yorker cartoonist Roz Chast faced a high rejection rate of about 90%. Even successful cartoonists experienced rejection rates of over 96%. Flexibility at lower levels of goal hierarchy is crucial, allowing for adjustments and new strategies.
  - Cartoonist Bob Mankoff's journey illustrates the importance of adaptability and persistence. Initially unsure of his career path, Bob transitioned from philosophy to psychology and then to cartooning. He faced countless rejections, but he ultimately succeeded by analyzing and emulating the successful styles of New Yorker cartoons.
- Strategies for Achieving Goals and Perseverance
  - Rejections and setbacks are part of any pursuit. However, it's essential to differentiate between lower-level and higher-level goals. While lower-level goals can be adjusted or replaced for efficiency, higher-level goals demand greater stubbornness and determination.
  - Perseverance involves navigating detours and adapting, especially for mid-level goals. While giving up on lower-level goals can be necessary, the ultimate aim and life philosophy should remain steadfast. Failure at the lower level doesn't equate to failure in the grand scheme.
  - A study by psychologist Catharine Cox delved into the characteristics of high achievers, revealing that intellectual talent alone doesn't guarantee eminence. The key factors distinguishing successful individuals were a combination of moderate intelligence and a high degree of persistence, reflected in qualities like working toward a specific goal, not abandoning tasks, and maintaining determination.
- The Power of Passion and Perseverance in Achieving Eminence
  - Cox's research highlighted the limited role of high intelligence in distinguishing eminent individuals from the rest. Instead, a cluster of indicators related to persistence of motive, passion, and perseverance stood out.
  - These indicators, reflecting qualities of passion and determination, were crucial for achieving eminence and separating the most eminent figures from the merely eminent.
  - The conclusion is that a combination of high intelligence and persistence is more likely to lead to eminence than high intelligence alone. The Grit Scale provides a means to self-reflect on one's passion, perseverance, and alignment of goals, allowing for progress and growth towards achieving meaningful accomplishments.

### Grit Grows
- Nature and Nurture Influence Grit:
  - The question of whether grit is influenced by genetics or upbringing is fundamental, with parallels to traits like height and language skills.
  - Every human trait, including grit, is influenced by a combination of genes and experience.
  - Scientific studies involving identical and fraternal twins have shown that both genetic factors and environmental experiences contribute to traits like grit.
- Traits Evolve Over Time:
  - Personality traits, including grit, change and evolve over time due to a combination of biological factors and life experiences.
  - The "maturity principle" suggests that individuals become more conscientious, confident, caring, and calm as they age.
  - Life experiences, challenges, and new situations prompt adaptations and changes in personality, leading to maturation.
- Building Grit: Interest, Practice, Purpose, and Hope:
  - Grit can be developed and cultivated by nurturing four psychological assets: interest, practice, purpose, and hope.
  - Passion starts with intrinsic enjoyment and curiosity in an endeavor, leading to sustained interest.
  - Diligent and focused practice, driven by a desire for continuous improvement, is crucial for developing grit.
  - A sense of purpose, linking personal interest with the well-being of others, strengthens the motivation to persevere.
  - Hope, the ability to rise above difficulties and doubts, is an ongoing factor in building and maintaining grit.

## Growing Grit From the Inside Out

### Interest
- Discovering and Nurturing Passion:
  - Early experiences in a variety of activities help young individuals identify their preferred interests and develop well-rounded skills.
  - "Sampling" various pursuits aids in cross-training muscles and skills, essential for comprehensive growth and balanced training.

  - Experts' ability to perceive and appreciate nuances due to accumulated knowledge and experience.
  - The process of passion development involves discovery, triggered by asking questions and experimenting, followed by development and deepening.
  - Deepening interests requires finding enjoyment in nuances, allowing individuals to engage for more than a few years in their pursuits.

### Practice
- The Debate between Deliberate Practice and Flow
  - A debate arose between Csikszentmihalyi and Ericsson about the role of passion and performance.
  - The two men resemble each other and discussed their opposing views on "passion and world-class performance."
  - The debate lacked conflict, and both sides provided contrasting perspectives on deliberate practice and flow.
  - The question remains whether experts suffer during practice or experience joy in their performance.
- Grit, Deliberate Practice, and Flow
  - Gritty individuals engage in more deliberate practice and experience more flow.
  - Grit and flow are not contradictory; deliberate practice involves behavior, while flow pertains to an experience.
  - Deliberate practice focuses on preparation, setting challenges to exceed current skills, and seeking improvement.
  - Flow, on the other hand, is a pleasurable state where skill and challenge match, resulting in effortless performance.
- Balancing Effortful Practice and Effortless Flow
  - Elite performers engage in extensive deliberate practice, resulting in moments of challenge-meeting-skill flow.
  - Swimmer Rowdy Gaines swam vast distances to win a 49-second race, highlighting the years of practice required.
  - Gritty performers emphasize hard work and passion for competition, which makes the practice worthwhile.
  - Grittier individuals often find deliberate practice both enjoyable and effortful, as it contributes to their progress.
  - The concept of changing the experience of deliberate practice suggests embracing challenge without shame, similar to how young children learn from mistakes.

### Purpose
- Discovering Purpose Through Experiences
  - Angela recalls their transformative experience in college when they stumbled upon a program called Summerbridge that aimed to teach middle school students from disadvantaged backgrounds during summer.
  - Initially, Angela's involvement seemed like a simple teaching opportunity, but it turned out to be a life-changing encounter that highlighted the potential impact of a teacher-student connection.
  - Reflecting on the summer, Angela realized that their purpose was not just to teach, but to make a significant difference in the lives of young learners.
  - The story emphasizes how Angela and a colleague's dedication to starting the Summerbridge program was fueled by their deep sense of purpose, despite initial challenges and lack of resources.
- The Intersection of Self-Oriented and Other-Oriented Motivations
  - The concept of "grit" and "purpose" is explored in relation to personal and prosocial motivations.
  - Grit, defined as perseverance and passion for long-term goals, is not necessarily opposed to caring for others.
  - The story of firefighters and fund-raisers illustrates that individuals driven by both self-oriented and other-oriented motives tend to exhibit higher levels of effort and commitment.
  - Young adolescents who identified with both self- and other-oriented goals demonstrated a greater sense of personal meaning and engagement in their schoolwork.
- Cultivating Purpose and Making a Difference
  - The story of entrepreneurs Aurora and Franco Fonte highlights their journey from starting a cleaning business to building a multimillion-dollar company with a sense of purpose.
  - Purpose, as described by developmental psychologist Bill Damon, begins with a spark of interest and evolves through exposure to purposeful role models who demonstrate the possibility of making a difference.
  - Kat Cole's story showcases how her mother's selfless nature inspired Kat to be helpful and seek purpose in her career.
  - Purpose can be cultivated at any age by reflecting on how one's work can contribute positively to society, engaging in "job crafting" to align work with values, and finding inspiration in purposeful role models.

### Hope
- Understanding Growth Mindset and Grit
  - Growth mindset and grit are essential factors for success and resilience in various aspects of life.
  - A growth mindset involves believing that abilities and talents can be developed through effort and learning.
  - On the contrary, a fixed mindset assumes that abilities are innate and unchangeable, which leads to pessimism in the face of challenges.
  - Grit refers to the combination of passion and perseverance, driving individuals to achieve long-term goals despite setbacks.
  - Researchers like Carol Dweck and Angela Duckworth have extensively studied and promoted the significance of these mindsets.
- Nurturing Growth Mindset and Grit in Various Settings

  - Optimistic self-talk, similar to cognitive behavioral therapy, can help reshape negative thought patterns and build resilience.
  - Seeking help and mentorship from individuals who inspire and support personal growth can significantly contribute to developing grit.
  - Both adversity and mastery experiences during adolescence contribute to forming a resilient brain circuitry, enhancing the ability to navigate challenges later in life.

## Growing Grit From the Outside In

### Parenting for Grit
- Wise Parenting and Its Impact
  - Wise parenting, also known as authoritative parenting, is characterized by understanding children's psychological needs and providing them with love, limits, and freedom to reach their potential.
  - This style is based on knowledge and wisdom, fostering a supportive, respectful, and demanding environment for children.
  - Neglectful, authoritarian, and permissive parenting styles are less effective and lack the positive outcomes seen in wise parenting.
  - Psychological research consistently shows that children of psychologically wise parents excel in school, exhibit self-reliance, and experience less anxiety and delinquent behavior.
  - The concept of imitation versus emulation is highlighted, emphasizing that wise parenting not only leads to imitation but also fosters children's eagerness to emulate their parents' behaviors and values.
- Encouraging Grit through Wise Parenting
  - Wise parenting cultivates grit in children by promoting their emulation of parents' characteristics and behaviors.
  - Parents who exemplify passion and perseverance in their own life goals inspire their children to adopt similar qualities.
  - Role models beyond parents, like mentors and teachers, play a significant role in shaping children's aspirations and attitudes.
  - Examples from individuals like Tobi Lütke and Cody Coleman highlight the influence of mentors and supportive adults in nurturing grit and determination.
  - Ron Ferguson's research demonstrates how teachers who are demanding and respectful contribute to students' academic skills, well-being, and engagement.
