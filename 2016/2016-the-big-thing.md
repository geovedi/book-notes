# The Big Thing: How to Complete Your Creative Project Even if You're a Lazy, Self-Doubting Procrastinator Like Me
**Authors**: Phyllis Korkki | **Year**: 2016 | **Category**: Self-Help & Personal Development

## Summary
"The Big Thing" is a practical guide to overcoming procrastination and completing meaningful creative projects. Written by a New York Times editor who describes herself as "possessed of a fine natural indolence," the book combines personal experience with extensive research into psychology, neuroscience, and creative processes. Korkki documents her own journey of writing this very book while exploring why so many people abandon their "Big Things"—those personally meaningful creative projects that require sustained effort but have no external deadlines or structure. The book argues that creative completion is less about innate genius or iron willpower and more about developing the right systems, habits, and mindset to work with our natural tendencies rather than against them.

This book is essential for anyone who has ever started a creative project only to abandon it halfway through—whether it's writing a novel, starting a business, creating art, or pursuing any long-term personal endeavor. Readers will learn practical strategies for managing procrastination, building sustainable routines, and maintaining motivation through the inevitable struggles of creative work.

## Core Insights

### The Nature of Creative Commitment
Big Things are fundamentally different from regular work because they come from within us rather than external demands. They reflect our personal talents, values, and points of view, making them deeply meaningful but also easy to postpone since no one else is expecting them. The book emphasizes that creative projects serve as a way to "order our experience and connect and amplify the moments of our lives" in a world of constant distraction. Unlike the fragmented attention we give to social media, news, and work tasks, Big Things require sustained concentration and provide structure for both our minds and daily lives.

> "Big Things aren't decided by employers or clients. They come from deep inside us, and reflect our personal talents, values, and points of view. They are a way for us to order our experience, and to connect and amplify the moments of our lives."

**Quick Take**: Your Big Thing deserves the same structural support you give your job—create deadlines, accountability systems, and routines that treat your creative work with the seriousness it deserves.

### Understanding Procrastination as Self-Betrayal
Korkki reveals that procrastination isn't just laziness—it's a profound betrayal of our future selves. Citing philosopher Christine Tappolet, she explains that procrastination reflects "a lack of concern for our future selves, to the point that we are willing to harm them in favor of our present selves." This insight transforms procrastination from a character flaw into a relationship problem: we treat our future creative selves as strangers we can burden with incomplete work and abandoned dreams. The solution is to build empathy and connection with our future selves through daily practices that honor their needs.

> "Future selves are considered to be strangers, to whom one can pass the buck and impose a heavy and uncompensated burden."

**Quick Take**: Start building a relationship with your future creative self today—each small action you take is a promise to the person you're becoming.

### The Half-Page Rule and Baby Steps
One of the book's most practical insights is that massive creative projects are completed through tiny, consistent actions rather than heroic efforts. Korkki's personal breakthrough came when she committed to writing just half a page per day, attached to her morning coffee ritual. This approach, inspired by ergonomics professor Alan Hedge's advice that success comes from "baby steps and routine," makes creative work sustainable by reducing the activation energy required to begin. The principle of inertia applies to creative work: once you start moving, you're more likely to continue moving, but the hardest part is always starting.

> "A hundred words here and a hundred there will add up over time."

**Quick Take**: Create a trigger-based habit (like coffee at your desk) that requires only minimal creative output—success comes from consistency, not intensity.

### Physical Foundation for Creative Success
The book makes a compelling case that creative work is fundamentally physical, and our mind-body connection directly impacts our ability to create. Korkki undertook lessons in posture, breathing, and movement to support her writing, discovering that physical alignment creates mental clarity. She learned horizontal diaphragmatic breathing to increase oxygen flow to the brain, studied Alexander Technique to release physical tension, and ensured proper sleep and nutrition. The research she cites shows that sleep deprivation impairs creativity by as much as threefold, while good sleep enhances creative problem-solving. Your body isn't just a vehicle for your mind—it's an integral part of your creative process.

> "The creative process is a physical experience. When we outsource our memory to our phones, we lose creative ballast."

**Quick Take**: Treat your body like a creative instrument—invest in proper breathing, posture, sleep, and nutrition to support your best creative work.

### The Power of External Accountability
Since Big Things lack natural deadlines and external pressures, successful creators must manufacture accountability. Korkki experimented with multiple accountability strategies, including hiring someone through Craigslist to call her every morning, finding accountability partners, and making public commitments. The book explains that we're more likely to follow through when others are watching and when there are social consequences for failure. This isn't about shame—it's about understanding human psychology and designing systems that work with our natural tendency to respond to social pressure and expectations.

> "I completed it on time because I would have let my coworkers down and endangered my reputation if I hadn't."

**Quick Take**: Create artificial accountability for your Big Thing—find a partner, make public commitments, or even hire someone to check in on your progress.

## Best Quotes

- "The hardest part is to start. The project is at its most amorphous at the very beginning, and the more vague it is the more anxiety it causes."

- "Two souls abide, alas, within my breast, And each one seeks for riddance from the other." (Goethe, on the struggle between repose and exertion)

- "We need to place more value on unitasking: working steadily toward the creation of one thing. Unitasking is more important than ever in our spliced-up world."

- "When I actively avoid working on my Big Thing, food tastes better and movies on the Lifetime channel seem unusually compelling."

- "The Big Thing is an accumulation of the moments where you brought yourself back to the thing you decided to create because it was meaningful to you."

## Action Items

- **Create a trigger-based habit**: Link your creative work to an existing daily routine (like morning coffee) and require only minimal output (half a page, 15 minutes, etc.)

- **Build physical foundations**: Practice proper breathing, ensure adequate sleep, and create an ergonomic workspace that supports sustained creative effort

- **Establish accountability systems**: Find a creative partner, join a writing group, or create deadlines with real consequences

- **Practice self-compassion**: Understand that procrastination is normal and focus on returning to the work rather than berating yourself

- **Start ridiculously small**: Break down your Big Thing into daily actions so small they're almost impossible to refuse

## Questions to Consider

- What stories have you been telling yourself about why you haven't completed your Big Thing, and how might those stories be protecting you from vulnerability?

- How would your relationship with your future self change if you treated them as a friend rather than a stranger to burden?

- What physical habits or limitations might be sabotaging your creative work, and what small changes could create immediate improvements?

- What accountability structures could you create that would make it more uncomfortable to abandon your project than to continue?

- What would it look like to reframe your Big Thing not as a burden to complete but as a structure that brings meaning to your daily life?

## Conclusion
"The Big Thing" is a refreshingly honest and practical guide that bypasses the usual creative cheerleading to deliver real strategies for completing meaningful work. Korkki's greatest strength is her willingness to document her own struggles and imperfections throughout the writing process, making her advice both credible and relatable. The book recognizes that most creative people aren't driven by obsessive passion or iron discipline, but by a deeper desire to express something meaningful while managing very human tendencies toward procrastination and distraction.

The biggest reason to read this book is its emphasis on sustainable, realistic approaches rather than heroic measures. Korkki shows that creative completion isn't about suddenly transforming into a different kind of person, but about understanding your tendencies and building systems that work with them. Her combination of scientific research, historical examples, and personal experimentation provides multiple pathways for finding what works for your specific situation and personality.

This book is worth your time if you're tired of creative self-help that assumes you need to completely overhaul your personality to succeed. Instead, it offers a compassionate but firm approach to building the habits, structures, and mindset needed to bring your Big Thing to completion—one half page at a time.
