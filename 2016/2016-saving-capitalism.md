# Saving Capitalism
**Authors**: Robert Reich | **Year**: 2016

## Summary
Robert Reich's "Saving Capitalism" argues that the "free market" is a myth - markets don't exist in nature but are created by governments through rules. Since the 1980s, large corporations, Wall Street, and the wealthy have gained disproportionate influence over these rules, reshaping them to channel wealth upward. This creates what Reich calls "predistribution" - an invisible upward redistribution embedded within market mechanisms themselves. The book challenges the prevailing debate between "free market" versus "government" as fundamentally false, arguing that the real question is who makes the rules and whom they serve.

This book is essential for anyone concerned about economic inequality, political corruption, or the future of American democracy. Readers will gain a clear understanding of how the economic system has been rigged and what can be done to restore capitalism to serve the many rather than the few.

## Core Insights

### The Free Market is a Myth
The central argument is that there's no such thing as a "free market" existing independently of government. Markets require rules governing property, monopoly, contracts, bankruptcy, and enforcement - all created by governments. The debate over "market vs. government" is therefore meaningless; governments create markets through the rules they establish.

> "Government doesn't 'intrude' on the 'free market.' It creates the market."

**Quick Take**: When politicians argue for "less government," they're really arguing for different rules that typically favor them or their patrons.

### The Five Building Blocks of Market Rules
Reich identifies five fundamental areas where rules determine market outcomes: property (what can be owned), monopoly (what market power is allowed), contracts (exchange terms), bankruptcy (what happens when people can't pay), and enforcement (how rules are upheld). These rules have been systematically reshaped since the 1980s to benefit corporations and the wealthy.

> "The rules are neither neutral nor universal, and they are not permanent. Different societies at different times have adopted different versions."

**Quick Take**: Understanding these five areas reveals where power operates to shape economic outcomes in favor of the wealthy.

### Predistribution: The Hidden Upward Transfer
While most people focus on government redistribution through taxes and transfers, Reich reveals that most redistribution happens upward within the market itself. This "predistribution" occurs through rules that systematically advantage the rich before government redistribution even begins.

> "Most redistribution in recent years has been in the other direction—upward from consumers, workers, small businesses, and small investors to top corporate and financial executives."

**Quick Take**: The real redistribution isn't taxes on the rich or benefits for the poor - it's the rules that channel wealth upward from the start.

### The Meritocratic Myth
The book demolishes the idea that people are paid what they're "worth." Reich shows how factors beyond individual merit - inheritance, connections, luck, and especially the rules shaped by powerful interests - determine earnings. The belief that pay reflects merit serves to justify extreme inequality.

> "People are 'worth' what they're paid in the market in the trivial sense that if the market rewards them a certain amount of money they must be. Some confuse this tautology for a moral claim that people deserve what they are paid."

**Quick Take**: If hedge fund managers make billions through insider trading and teachers create $250,000 of value per student but earn modest salaries, the system isn't based on merit.

### The Loss of Countervailing Power
Reich argues that the core problem isn't that corporations and the wealthy have too much power, but that ordinary people have too little countervailing power. When unions were strong and the middle class had political influence, the rules balanced different interests. Now, with only one side having power, the rules inevitably favor that side.

> "There is no longer any significant countervailing power, no force to constrain or balance the growing political strength of large corporations, Wall Street, and the very wealthy."

**Quick Take**: The solution isn't to eliminate the power of corporations and the wealthy, but to restore power to ordinary citizens.

## Best Quotes
- "The 'free market' is a myth that prevents us from examining these rule changes and asking whom they serve."
- "There are two modes of invading private property; the first, by which the poor plunder the rich … sudden and violent; the second, by which the rich plunder the poor, slow and legal."
- "If we are very generous with ourselves, I suppose we might claim that we 'earned' as much as one fifth of our income. The rest is the patrimony associated with being a member of an enormously productive social system."

## Action Items
- Examine economic debates for who benefits from proposed rule changes
- Support stronger antitrust enforcement and breaking up monopolies
- Advocate for policies that strengthen worker bargaining power
- Support campaign finance reform to reduce corporate political influence
- Promote policies that make the rules of the market more transparent

## Questions to Consider
- If markets require rules, who should make those rules and whose interests should they serve?
- How can ordinary citizens regain countervailing power in a system dominated by money and influence?
- What would a market system look like if rules were designed to serve broad prosperity rather than concentrating wealth?
- Is the current level of economic inequality compatible with a functioning democracy?

## Conclusion
"Saving Capitalism" is essential reading for understanding how the American economy has been systematically rigged to benefit the wealthy at the expense of everyone else. Reich's genius lies in revealing that the problem isn't capitalism itself, but who makes the rules that govern markets. By debunking the myth of the "free market," he shows that the current system is the result of political choices that can be changed. The book is worth your time because it provides a clear framework for understanding economic power and offers hope that capitalism can indeed work for the many, not just the few - but only if ordinary citizens regain the power to shape the rules.
