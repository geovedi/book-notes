**Authors**: Don Tapscott, Anthony D. Williams | **Year**: 2006 (Expanded Edition 2008)

## Summary
Wikinomics explores how mass collaboration is revolutionizing business, innovation, and wealth creation in the digital age. The book argues that traditional hierarchical corporate structures are being replaced by new models based on community, collaboration, and self-organization. Thanks to Web 2.0 technologies, companies can now source ideas, innovations, and talent from a vast global pool, transforming how products and services are conceived, developed, and distributed.

The book is essential reading for business leaders, entrepreneurs, and anyone interested in understanding how the internet is fundamentally changing economic structures. Readers will gain actionable insights into harnessing collective intelligence, opening up their organizations, and thriving in an era of unprecedented collaboration.

## Core Insights

### The Four Principles of Wikinomics
The new art and science of mass collaboration rests on four powerful ideas that are replacing old business tenets:

**Openness**: Traditional secrecy is giving way to transparent business practices where companies share proprietary data, intellectual property, and internal processes with external partners and even competitors. This openness accelerates innovation by tapping into global expertise and perspectives that would otherwise remain outside organizational boundaries.

> "The new art and science of wikinomics is based on four powerful new ideas: openness, peering, sharing, and acting globally. These new principles are replacing some of the old tenets of business."

**Quick Take**: Opening your organization isn't just about transparency—it's about accessing intelligence and capabilities that exist beyond your corporate walls.

**Peering**: Hierarchical structures are being replaced by peer-to-peer networks where participants collaborate as equals rather than as superior-subordinate relationships. This horizontal organization enables more rapid innovation and problem-solving by eliminating bottlenecks in traditional command-and-control systems.

**Sharing**: The book demonstrates how sharing intellectual property, research, and resources can create win-win scenarios that expand markets and opportunities for all participants. Counterintuitively, sharing often leads to greater competitive advantage rather than diminished returns.

> "Just as it's true that a rising tide lifts all boats, we genuinely believe that radical sharing is a win-win for everyone. Expanding markets create new opportunities."

**Quick Take**: Sharing isn't zero-sum—it's about expanding the pie rather than just competing for existing slices.

**Acting Globally**: Companies must move beyond being merely multinational to becoming truly global, seamlessly integrating capabilities and talent across borders. This requires overcoming legacy systems and processes that hinder global collaboration.

### The Goldcorp Challenge: A Case Study in Openness
The book opens with the remarkable story of Goldcorp Inc., a struggling gold mining company whose CEO, Rob McEwen, faced dwindling production and skeptical internal geologists. In an unprecedented move, McEwen decided to publish all of the company's proprietary geological data online and offer $575,000 in prize money to anyone who could identify new gold deposits.

The "Goldcorp Challenge" attracted over 1,000 virtual prospectors from 50 countries, who identified targets worth billions of dollars. Participants using techniques completely foreign to the traditional mining industry discovered gold deposits that the company's own geologists had missed for decades.

> "McEwen had an epiphany and sat back in his chair to contemplate. If Goldcorp employees couldn't find the Red Lake gold, maybe someone else could. And maybe the key to finding those people was to open up the exploration process in the same way Torvalds 'open sourced' Linux."

**Quick Take**: Sometimes the best expertise for your problems exists outside your organization—you just need to be open enough to access it.

### The Wiki Workplace
Traditional workplaces are transforming into "wiki workplaces" where employees collaborate across organizational boundaries to drive performance. Internal hierarchies are becoming less important than an employee's ability to contribute to collaborative networks and access collective intelligence.

This shift is enabled by new collaboration technologies but also driven by generational change. The Net Generation (digital natives) brings expectations of openness, participation, and interactivity into workplaces, pushing organizations to become more collaborative and less hierarchical.

### Customers as Prosumers
The line between producers and consumers is blurring as customers become "prosumers" who co-create goods and services rather than simply consuming finished products. Companies that successfully engage customers as partners in innovation and value creation gain significant competitive advantages.

This transformation is visible across industries, from open-source software where users contribute code, to consumer products where customers help design features, to media where audiences generate content alongside professional creators.

- **Create sharing mechanisms**: Develop platforms and processes for sharing knowledge and resources with partners, customers, and even competitors
- **Build global collaboration capabilities**: Invest in technologies and processes that enable seamless global teamwork across time zones and cultures
- **Engage customers as co-creators**: Create channels for customers to participate in product development, improvement, and innovation

## Questions to Consider

- What proprietary information could your organization share to gain access to external expertise?
- How might your industry be transformed if competitors began collaborating on shared challenges?
- Which organizational processes could benefit from peer-based rather than hierarchical structures?
