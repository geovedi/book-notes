# Saints Behaving Badly
**Authors**: Thomas J. Craughwell | **Year**: 2006

## Summary
"Saints Behaving Badly" shatters the conventional image of saints as perpetually pious, otherworldly figures. Through compelling biographical accounts of notorious sinners who transformed into revered saints, Craughwell demonstrates that sanctity is not about innate perfection but about radical transformation through divine grace. The book presents a provocative collection of historical figures—including extortionists, murderers, con artists, and promiscuous actors—who abandoned lives of crime and corruption to become some of Christianity's most revered saints.

This book is perfect for skeptics who find traditional saints' stories unrealistic, believers seeking encouragement about redemption, and history buffs fascinated by the messy, human side of religious transformation. Readers will discover that the path to holiness is often paved with serious mistakes, moral failures, and dramatic conversions that prove no one is beyond redemption's reach.

## Core Insights

### 1. Saintliness Is Not Perfection—It's Transformation
The central thesis of the book is that saints aren't born; they're made through dramatic conversion experiences. Traditional hagiography often sanitizes saints' early lives with vague phrases like "once a great sinner," but the early Church was refreshingly candid about saints' scandalous pasts. This honesty serves a crucial purpose: it demonstrates that God's grace can reach anyone, regardless of how depraved their former life might be.

> "Every day, all day long, God pours out his grace upon us, urging us, coaxing us, to turn away from everything that is base and cheap and unsatisfying, and turn toward the only thing that is eternal, perfect, and true—that is, himself."

**Quick Take**: Your past doesn't disqualify you from a future of grace; it's actually part of the evidence of transformation.

### 2. The Conversion Process Is Brutally Hard
The book emphasizes that conversion isn't magic—it's just the beginning of a lifelong struggle against deeply ingrained sinful habits. Each saint's story reveals the difficulty of shedding old patterns, the resistance from former associates, and the internal battles that rage long after the initial conversion moment. Saint Francis of Assisi, for instance, kept falling back into his wastrel ways even after his dramatic encounter with the crucifix at San Damiano.

> "A conversion experience is not magic; it is only the first step in a lifetime of striving to avoid the old sins, grow in virtue, and conform one's unruly, rebellious will to the will of God."

**Quick Take**: Real transformation requires sustained effort, not just a single dramatic moment.

### 3. Criminal Past Becomes Spiritual Assets
Many saints' former lives uniquely prepared them for their ministries. Matthew's experience as a tax collector made him ideal for reaching out to other social outcasts. Moses the Ethiopian's background as a gang leader gave him credibility when ministering to violent criminals. Saint John of God's gambling addiction helped him understand and rescue other compulsive gamblers. Their "sinful expertise" became divine tools for reaching others trapped in similar lifestyles.

**Quick Take**: Your darkest experiences might be preparing you for your greatest purpose.

### 4. The More Scandalous, The More Hopeful
The book's most striking insight is that the worse the saint's former life, the more hope their stories offer to ordinary sinners. Saint Olga, who murdered thousands in revenge for her husband's assassination, became a model of mercy. Saint Vladimir, who practiced human sacrifice and committed fratricide, transformed Russia into a Christian nation. These extreme examples suggest that if grace can reach even the most depraved, there's hope for everyone.

**Quick Take**: The depth of someone's fall often becomes the measure of their testimony's power.

### 5. Sanctity Requires Social Rebellion
Many saints had to rebel against their social circles, family expectations, and cultural norms to pursue holiness. Saint Francis rejected his wealthy father's expectations and faced public humiliation. Saint Margaret of Cortona abandoned her life as a rich man's mistress and faced scorn from society. Their courage shows that authentic transformation often requires breaking free from the relationships and systems that enable sin.

**Quick Take**: Sometimes becoming holy means becoming unpopular with the people who benefit from your old self.

## Best Quotes

- "Where is Mary Magdalene? I can see the reviewers' complaints now. How can you write a book about saints who started out as notorious sinners and omit the most famous converted sinner of all? The short answer is 'Mary Magdalene was not a notorious sinner.'"

- "I came not to call the just, but sinners." — Jesus Christ (as quoted in Matthew's story)

- "The point of reading these stories is not to experience some tabloid thrill, but to understand how grace works in the world."

- "Most of us will never know a saint. Saints need not be infallibly perfect all the time. As I mentioned earlier, for the 2000 years of the Church's history, hagiographers gloried in the lives of great sinners who became great saints. Their message is reassuring: if these people can be saved, then so can you!"

## Key Examples from the Book

### Saint Matthew: The Corrupt Tax Collector
As a tax collector in Capernaum, Matthew collaborated with Roman oppressors and extorted his fellow Jews. When Jesus called him with "Follow me," Matthew left his money table immediately, abandoning a life of government-sanctioned theft. His financial expertise later helped him organize the Christian community and write one of the four Gospels.

### Saint Olga: The Vengeful Mass Murderer
After her husband was assassinated, Olga orchestrated elaborate revenge schemes that killed thousands. She buried alive the messengers who delivered the death news, burned hundreds alive in bathhouses, and destroyed entire villages. Later, after converting to Christianity, she became known for mercy and established churches throughout Russia.

### Saint Francis: The Wealthy Wastrel
Born to a wealthy merchant, Francis squandered his fortune on parties, expensive clothes, and entertaining the worst elements of Assisi society. After his conversion, he embraced radical poverty and founded the Franciscan order, becoming one of Christianity's most beloved saints.

### Saint Augustine: The Heretic Playboy
For seventeen years, Augustine lived with a mistress, rejected his mother's Catholic faith, and pursued heretical philosophies. After his dramatic conversion, he became a bishop, theologian, and wrote one of Christianity's most influential works, "Confessions."

### Saint Camillus de Lellis: The Cardsharp Con Man
A gambling addict and con artist who wasted his inheritance and resorted to cheating and violence, Camillus hit rock bottom before experiencing conversion. He founded an order dedicated to caring for the sick and became the patron saint of hospital workers.

## Conclusion

"Saints Behaving Badly" is worth reading because it demolishes the myth that holiness requires perfection. Instead, it presents a radical vision of Christianity where grace meets sinners exactly where they are—in the mess of real life. The book's power lies in its historical accuracy and narrative skill, bringing to life figures who were more scandalous in their time than most modern "bad boys" could imagine.

The biggest reason to read this book is its message of hope. If tax collectors, murderers, con artists, and promiscuous actors could become saints, then there's hope for everyone—regardless of their past. This isn't just inspirational fluff; it's documented history that challenges both religious and secular assumptions about human potential and divine grace.

For anyone who's ever felt "too far gone" for redemption, or anyone who's skeptical about religious transformation, this book offers compelling evidence that nobody is beyond the reach of grace—and that's a message worth remembering in any age.
