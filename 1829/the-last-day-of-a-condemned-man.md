***

"The Last Day of a Condemned Man" by Victor Hugo is a powerful novella published in 1829. Set in 19th-century France, the story revolves around an unnamed man who has been condemned to die by the guillotine. Written as a series of intimate and haunting reflections, the narrative captures the condemned man's thoughts, emotions, and fears while he awaits his execution in the prison of Bicêtre.

Victor Hugo penned this work as a plea for the abolition of the death penalty, fueled by his own anger and dismay at witnessing the gruesome spectacle of public executions. The novella was inspired by an encounter with an executioner preparing the guillotine on the Place de l'Hotel de Ville.

The condemned man's writing delves into his evolving psyche throughout his imprisonment. He describes his life in prison, the bleak conditions, and the personalities of the people he encounters, including the prison priest. While he hints at having killed someone, he keeps the details vague, leaving the victim's identity unknown.

The novella also reveals a connection to Hugo's later work, "Les Misérables," as the condemned man meets another prisoner who shares a similar backstory to Jean Valjean. This connection emphasizes the recurring theme of social injustice in Hugo's writings.

In a desperate bid to escape, the condemned man attempts to deceive a superstitious guard to exchange clothes, but his plan fails, intensifying his sense of hopelessness. As his execution day approaches, he catches a final glimpse of his three-year-old daughter, who no longer recognizes him, devastating the already anguished man.

The story culminates on the day of the execution, where the condemned man pleads for pardon in a moment of desperation. The novella leaves readers with an uncertain ending, amplifying the emotional impact and leaving them to grapple with the profound themes of life, death, and societal cruelty.

Despite being lesser-known compared to some of Hugo's other works, "The Last Day of a Condemned Man" earned praise from Fyodor Dostoevsky, who considered it incredibly authentic and truthful. Dostoevsky's own experiences with a mock execution and the impending threat of death added depth to his appreciation of the novella.

Hugo's insightful and empathetic portrayal of the condemned man's inner turmoil, coupled with his vehement denunciation of the death penalty, makes "The Last Day of a Condemned Man" a thought-provoking and poignant literary work that continues to resonate with readers, sparking discussions about justice, humanity, and the value of life.
