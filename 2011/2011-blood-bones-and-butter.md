### Food as Family Language
Growing up with a French mother who understood life through food, Hamilton learned that cooking wasn't just about sustenance—it was about love, culture, and communication. Her mother taught her to forage for mushrooms, identify edible plants, and appreciate the ritual of meals, creating a foundation that would later become her professional language.
