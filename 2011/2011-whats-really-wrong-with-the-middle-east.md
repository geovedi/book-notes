# What's Really Wrong With the Middle East
**Authors**: Brian Whitaker | **Year**: 2011

## Summary
Brian Whitaker, former Middle East editor at the Guardian, delivers a provocative analysis of the Arab world's fundamental problems that goes beyond surface-level political explanations. Written during the early Arab Spring uprisings, the book argues that the region's issues stem not just from authoritarian rulers but from deep-seated social, cultural, and educational factors that permeate Arab societies.

Whitaker challenges Western misconceptions while simultaneously urging Arabs to confront uncomfortable truths about their own societies. He contends that real change requires more than regime change—it demands transformation of societal attitudes, family structures, education systems, and religious interpretations that have long held back progress.

This book is essential for anyone seeking to understand the Middle East beyond headlines and political rhetoric. It offers valuable insights for policymakers, journalists, and general readers who want to grasp the complex social dynamics shaping the Arab world today.

## Core Insights

### 1. Thinking Inside the Box: The Education Crisis
The Arab education system stifles critical thinking and creativity through rote memorization and authoritarian teaching methods. Students learn to reproduce "the doctor's opinion" rather than develop independent analytical skills. This educational approach creates graduates who can follow instructions but cannot innovate or question authority.

> "Communication in education is didactic, supported by set books containing indisputable texts in which knowledge is objectified so as to hold incontestable facts, and by an examination process that only tests memorisation and factual recall."

**Quick Take**: Without educational reform that encourages critical thinking, the Arab world cannot develop the human capital needed for modern economies and democratic governance.

### 2. The Gilded Cage: Family and Social Control
The traditional family structure in Arab societies operates as both a source of security and a mechanism of social control. Families restrict individual freedom, especially for women, creating what Whitaker calls "gilded cages" that limit personal autonomy and social mobility.

> "Arab society is the family generalised or enlarged, and the family is society in miniature."

**Quick Take**: The family as a microcosm of the state explains why authoritarian patterns persist—from the household to national government.

### 3. States Without Citizens: Lack of Civic Engagement
Arab states have failed to develop genuine citizenship where rights and responsibilities flow between government and governed. Instead, subjects receive benefits and services in exchange for loyalty, creating dependency rather than empowerment.

**Quick Take**: Without a concept of citizenship, there's no foundation for democratic participation or accountability.

### 4. The Politics of God: Religion and Authority
The instrumentalization of religion for political purposes has created an environment where questioning religious authority becomes equated with challenging the state. This fusion of religious and political power stifles reform and innovation.

**Quick Take**: When religious dogma becomes political dogma, both faith and governance suffer.

### 5. Vitamin W: The System of Wasta
"Wasta" (connections/influence) operates as an alternative system of justice and opportunity, undermining merit-based advancement and rule of law. This system of favoritism and patronage affects everything from employment to legal proceedings.

**Quick Take**: Until merit replaces connections as the primary path to success, corruption and inefficiency will persist.

### 6. The Urge to Control: Media and Information Censorship
Arab governments maintain tight control over media and information flow, preventing the development of a truly independent press that could hold power accountable. Self-censorship is often as effective as official censorship.

**Quick Take**: Without free media, there's no mechanism for exposing corruption or facilitating informed public debate.

### 7. A Sea of Victims: Discrimination and Racism
Deep-seated discrimination based on ethnicity, race, and gender remains widespread in Arab societies. Colorism and racial hierarchies persist despite Islamic teachings against racism.

> "In fact, it was so common that I had no awareness of its negative connotations until well into my teenage years."

**Quick Take**: Until societies confront internal discrimination, they cannot build truly inclusive and progressive nations.

### 8. Alien Tomatoes: Economic Mismanagement
Arab economies remain dependent on oil, foreign aid, and imported goods rather than developing productive domestic industries. This economic dependency perpetuates political vulnerability and limits sovereignty.

**Quick Take**: Economic diversification is essential for political independence and sustainable development.

### 9. Escape from History: The Burden of the Past
The Arab world remains trapped between nostalgia for a golden Islamic past and resentment of Western imperialism. This historical baggage prevents objective assessment of contemporary challenges and opportunities.

**Quick Take**: Progress requires engaging with the present rather than dwelling on past glories or grievances.

## Best Quotes

- "Egypt has a million Mubaraks. In other words, the Mubarak way of doing things is not confined to the country's president; it is found throughout Egyptian society, in business and even within families."

- "Social discrimination is the greatest of all ailments facing Arab societies today. It creates government in its own image but it also poisons the mentality for reform and definitely for democracy."

- "Education in the Arab countries is where the paternalism of the traditional family structure, the authoritarianism of the state and the dogmatism of religion all meet, discouraging critical thought and analysis, stifling creativity and instilling submissiveness."

- "If a person cannot walk into the middle of the town square and express his or her views without fear of arrest, imprisonment, or physical harm, then that person is living in a fear society, not a free society."

- "Arab society is the family generalised or enlarged, and the family is society in miniature."

## Questions to Consider

1. How can traditional family values coexist with individual freedom and gender equality?
2. What role should religion play in modern Arab governance and society?
3. How can Arab economies transition from dependency to genuine independence?
4. Is democracy compatible with Arab cultural and religious traditions?
5. What responsibility do Western countries bear for Arab problems, and what responsibility lies within Arab societies themselves?

## Conclusion
"What's Really Wrong With the Middle East" is a courageous and necessary book that challenges both Western misconceptions and Arab self-deception. Whitaker's analysis demonstrates that the Arab Spring uprisings, while historically significant, only addressed the surface symptoms of deeper societal problems.

The book's greatest strength is its comprehensive approach—connecting education, family structure, religion, economics, and politics into a coherent analysis of why Arab societies have struggled to modernize and democratize. Whitaker avoids both Western paternalism and Arab defensiveness, instead offering constructive criticism aimed at fostering genuine progress.

This is essential reading for anyone who wants to understand the Middle East beyond superficial headlines. While some may find Whitaker's analysis uncomfortable, his arguments are well-supported and his insights valuable. The book doesn't offer easy solutions, but it correctly identifies the problems that must be addressed for real change to occur.

For readers seeking to understand why the Arab Spring's initial promise has largely faded, and what deeper changes are needed for the region to progress, this book provides indispensable insights that remain relevant years after its publication.
