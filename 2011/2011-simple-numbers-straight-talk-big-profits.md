# Simple Numbers, Straight Talk, Big Profits!
**Authors**: Greg Crabtree, Beverly Blair Harzog | **Year**: 2011 | **Category**: Business & Finance

## Summary
This book reveals the four essential keys to business success that most entrepreneurs miss entirely. Crabtree, a CPA who works exclusively with entrepreneurs, discovered that business owners consistently make the same critical mistakes—particularly around owner compensation and profit metrics. The book provides a straightforward framework for understanding the true financial health of your business using simple, actionable numbers rather than complex accounting jargon.

Perfect for business owners from startup to $5 million in revenue, this guide transforms how you view your business finances. You'll learn to see beyond distorted revenue figures to understand what really drives profitability and sustainable growth. The concepts are so fundamental yet overlooked that they apply to businesses of any size, though they're most crucial during the vulnerable growth phase between $1-5 million.

## Core Insights

### The Market-Based Wage Foundation
You get paid a salary for what you DO, and you get a return on what you OWN. This fundamental distinction is the most violated principle in small business. Until you pay yourself a market-based wage and plug that number into your financials, your profit numbers are lying to you.

> "Sales are for show, profits are for dough!"

Most entrepreneurs think they're overpaying themselves, but at least 90% are underpaying themselves—typically around the "magic" $30,000 that IRS auditors flag immediately. This distortion makes your financial data worthless, like having a compass that's five degrees off in every direction. Your number one key performance indicator isn't revenue or even profit—it's how big a check you write to the IRS this year.

**Quick Take**: If you can't afford to pay yourself a market-based wage, you're operating at a loss. Track this "sweat equity" separately and create a plan to reach profitability quickly.

### The New Breakeven: 10% is the Floor
Forget traditional breakeven analysis—it's fatally flawed. When your pretax profit hits 5% of revenue, your business is on life support. Here's the reality:

- **5% or less**: Business is on life support
- **10%**: You have a good business
- **15% or more**: You have a great business

Focus on pretax profit (not EBITDA) and gross profit rather than revenue. Revenue means nothing; it's just a vanity metric. Your gross profit is what matters—it's the true economic engine of your business. Every dollar of revenue isn't equal, but every dollar of gross profit is.

**Quick Take**: Aim for 10% pretax profit minimum. The gap between 5% and 10% is the difference between survival and building a sustainable business.

### Navigating the Black Hole ($1-5 Million)
The most dangerous phase is between $1-5 million in revenue—what Crabtree calls "the black hole." This is when you must add staffing and infrastructure before you can really afford it, potentially destroying your profitability.

The key is understanding your **salary cap**—the total amount you can spend on all labor (including your market-based wage) while maintaining target profitability. For a $1 million business aiming for 10% pretax profit:
- Revenue: $1,000,000
- Target profit: $100,000
- Available for expenses: $900,000
- Minus nonsalary costs: -$400,000
- **Salary cap: $500,000**

Every business operates under a salary cap, just like NFL teams. The Patriots won Super Bowls not by spending more, but by getting maximum productivity per dollar spent on labor.

**Quick Take**: Maintain minimum 10% pretax profit as you grow. Your salary cap includes your own market-based wage and tells you exactly how much you can spend on total labor costs.

### The Four Forces of Cash Flow
Most entrepreneurs don't understand where their profits go. Crabtree identifies four forces that control your cash flow—in order of priority:

1. **Taxes**: First and always. Set aside quarterly in a separate account.
2. **Debt repayment**: You can't build wealth until you're debt-free. Lines of credit are "crack cocaine" for businesses.
3. **Core capital target**: Two months of operating expenses in cash with zero drawn on credit lines.
4. **Distributions**: Last priority, after all others are satisfied.

This framework prevents "cash cow disease"—killing your healthy business by taking too much out too soon. Remember: a business is like a cow. You can keep it healthy and milk it every day, or you can have one barbecue.

**Quick Take**: Use profits to first pay taxes, then eliminate debt, then build cash reserves, and only then take distributions for personal wealth building.

## Best Quotes

- "Revenue is for show, profits are for dough!"
- "A business is like a cow. Until you pay yourself a market-based wage and make a profit on top of that, you have a sick cow on your hands."
- "Every business has a salary cap. Even an NFL team."
- "If you're not paying taxes, there are only two possibilities: You didn't make any income or you're cheating."
- "I can only dream as far as I can see... And when I get there, I can always see farther."

## Action Items

- **Calculate your market-based wage**: What would it cost to replace you? Use salary surveys like Salary.com or ERI's Salary Survey Assessor.
- **Determine your true pretax profit**: Add your market-based wage to expenses, then calculate what's left after all costs.
- **Establish your salary cap**: Based on target 10% pretax profit, calculate maximum total labor costs including your wage.
- **Build your core capital reserve**: Save until you have two months of operating expenses in cash with zero debt.
- **Review your financials monthly**: Focus on gross profit margins, pretax profit percentage, and labor productivity metrics.

## Questions to Consider

- Are you paying yourself what you're really worth, or are you building sweat equity that needs to be tracked?
- Is your business actually profitable when you include a market-based owner salary?
- Which stage of the black hole are you in, and do you have the capital reserves to survive it?
- Are you living off your business profits or your market-based wage?
- If you sold your business tomorrow, would the financials stand up to serious scrutiny?

## Conclusion

This is worth your time because it reveals the fundamental mistakes that kill most businesses between $1-5 million in revenue. Crabtree's framework is brutally simple yet transformative: pay yourself properly, maintain 10%+ pretax profit, understand your salary cap, and manage cash flow using the four forces.

The biggest reason to read it? You'll finally understand why your profitable business never has cash. Most entrepreneurs think they're doing well because revenue is growing, but they're actually building a house of cards on distorted numbers. This book gives you the metrics that matter and the courage to make the hard decisions that separate businesses that survive from those that thrive.

The concepts are so straightforward that you can implement them immediately, and they'll change how you view every business decision forever. It's not about complex accounting—it's about seeing the simple numbers that tell the real story of your business.
