# Killing Lincoln: The Shocking Assassination that Changed America Forever
**Authors**: Bill O'Reilly, Martin Dugard | **Year**: 2011

## Summary
"Killing Lincoln" is a gripping historical narrative that chronicles the final days of the Civil War and the shocking assassination of Abraham Lincoln. The book masterfully weaves together multiple storylines: Lincoln's hopeful vision for reunification as the war winds down, Robert E. Lee's desperate retreat with his starving Confederate army, Ulysses S. Grant's relentless pursuit, and John Wilkes Booth's transformation from Confederate sympathizer to assassin. Set against the backdrop of a nation transitioning from war to peace, the narrative builds tension through alternating perspectives that converge on that fateful Good Friday at Ford's Theatre.

This book is perfect for history enthusiasts who prefer narrative non-fiction over dry academic texts, as well as readers who enjoy political thrillers and character-driven stories. Those fascinated by the Civil War era, presidential history, or true crime will find themselves completely absorbed. The authors' fast-paced, almost cinematic storytelling makes complex historical events accessible and engaging, while still maintaining historical accuracy and depth.

## Core Insights
**Essential plot**: The story begins in April 1865, with Lincoln aboard the River Queen, watching Grant's forces break through Confederate lines at Petersburg. As Lee's army begins its desperate retreat toward the Carolinas, Lincoln visits conquered Richmond and delivers a speech advocating forgiveness rather than punishment for the South. Meanwhile, John Wilkes Booth, a famous actor and Confederate zealot, sees the South's defeat and Lincoln's progressive policies (including potential voting rights for educated African Americans) as an existential threat. The narrative shifts between Lincoln's hopeful leadership and Booth's plotting, culminating in the assassination at Ford's Theatre on April 14, 1865.

**Key turning points**: The fall of Petersburg and Richmond; Lee's surrender at Appomattox; Lincoln's speech advocating for lenient Reconstruction terms; Booth hearing Lincoln speak about extending voting rights to African Americans; Lincoln choosing to attend Ford's Theatre instead of staying home despite warnings; Booth's meticulous planning of the assassination and escape routes.

**Main characters**:
- Abraham Lincoln: The tall, melancholic president burdened by war but filled with hopeful vision for reunification
- John Wilkes Booth: The handsome, charismatic actor consumed by racist hatred and desperate for lasting fame
- Ulysses S. Grant: Lincoln's quiet, determined general who relentlessly pursues Lee's army
- Robert E. Lee: The proud, beleaguered Confederate commander facing the inevitable defeat
- Mary Todd Lincoln: The emotionally fragile first lady who persuades Lincoln to attend the theater

**Emotional core**: The book's power comes from the stark contrast between Lincoln's generous, forward-looking vision for America's future and Booth's violent, backward-looking hatred. The narrative creates almost unbearable tension as we watch Lincoln move through his final days, unaware of the detailed assassination plot unfolding around him, while Booth transforms from kidnapper to murderer.

**The ending**: Lincoln is assassinated at Ford's Theatre while watching "Our American Cousin." Booth escapes but is later shot dead after a 12-day manhunt. The book explores how Lincoln's death ironically led to harsher Reconstruction policies than he had advocated, potentially setting back racial equality for generations. The conspirators are captured and executed, while Secretary of War Stanton potentially benefits from Lincoln's death.
