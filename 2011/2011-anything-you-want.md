## Summary
"Anything You Want" is the unconventional entrepreneurship memoir of Derek Sivers, who accidentally built CD Baby from a simple favor for friends into a $22 million company.

Readers will discover how to build a meaningful business without sacrificing personal values, why growth isn't always the goal, and how to create a company that serves both customers and the founder's happiness.

## Core Insights

### Business Is About Making Dreams Come True
Sivers started CD Baby not to make money, but to solve a personal problem: selling his own CD online. His mission was to create the perfect distribution deal he'd want as a musician—weekly payments, full customer information, never getting dropped for low sales, and no paid placement. When you build something that makes your own dreams come true, it will likely help others achieve their dreams too.

> "When you make a company, you make a utopia. It's where you design your perfect world."

**Quick Take**: Start by solving your own problem. Your personal frustration is often the seed of a great business idea.

### Success Comes From Improving, Not Promoting
Sivers learned that persistence should be focused on improving and inventing, not pushing what isn't working. Like a songwriter writing hundreds of songs until one becomes a hit, entrepreneurs should keep iterating until something resonates deeply with customers. If you're not getting an enthusiastic "HELL YEAH!" response, it's time to try something new.

> "Success comes from persistently improving and inventing, not from persistently promoting what's not working."

**Quick Take**: Don't waste years fighting uphill battles. Keep creating new things until customers can't live without them.

### You Don't Need Money to Start
Having no funding was actually an advantage for CD Baby. Without investors to please, Sivers could focus entirely on customers. He learned programming himself, built desks from cinder blocks, and kept expenses minimal. Starting small forces you to solve real problems for real people rather than building infrastructure nobody needs.

> "By not having any money to waste, you never waste money."

**Quick Take**: Start now with what you have. A useful prototype beats a perfect business plan every time.

### Care About Customers More Than Yourself
When asked how he'd compete if musicians set up their own stores, Sivers replied he didn't care about CD Baby's survival—only about helping musicians. This customer-first approach built trust and loyalty. Your business should be willing to die for your customers' success.

> "Care about your customers more than about yourself, and you'll do well."

**Quick Take**: Focus obsessively on serving your customers, even if it means making your own business obsolete someday.

### Little Things Make All The Difference
CD Baby became beloved through tiny human touches: a humorous shipping confirmation email about a "private CD Baby jet," answering phones within two rings, personalizing email fields to say "CD Baby loves [customer name]," and fulfilling special requests like including rubber squids in packages. These small details created more word-of-mouth marketing than any advertising campaign could.

> "When you find even the smallest way to make people smile, they'll remember you more for that smile than for all your other fancy business-model stuff."

**Quick Take**: Invest in delightful small details that make customers feel seen and valued.
