## Mind: The Gap
- Unconscious Brain Processes and Decision Making:
  - Unconscious processes simulate past events and use physical feelings to navigate decisions.
  - Feelings from events influence subsequent choices - bad feelings discourage, good feelings encourage.
  - Unconscious hunches often lead to correct decisions due to quicker processing.
  - Prosopagnosia illustrates unconscious recognition of familiar faces despite conscious inability.
- Conscious Mind's Role in Training and Planning:
  - Conscious mind trains and sets goals for unconscious neural machinery.
  - Consciousness acts as a long-term planner, guiding neural circuits to meet goals.

  - Unconscious biases might not be suitable as legal evidence due to complex decision-making.
  - Biases may not always directly influence final behavior due to socialized mechanisms.

## The Kinds of Thoughts That Are Thinkable

  - Unconscious software and programs are deeply ingrained in human behavior, forming instincts.
  - These instincts are encoded in DNA through natural selection.
  - Hardwired cognitive programs are inaccessible to conscious awareness.
  - "Instinct blindness" refers to the lack of awareness of instincts that drive behavior.
  - William James proposed coaxing instincts to light by questioning their reasons.
  - Instincts are inaccessible but critical, not open to conscious improvement.
- Beauty and Attraction:
  - Human beauty judgments are deeply ingrained and have evolutionary significance.
  - Beauty is determined by traits reflecting fertility and health.
  - Symmetry, waist-to-hip ratio, and specific physical traits signal fertility.
  - Attraction is guided by neural programs that drive behavior.
  - Even when judgments seem natural, they are neurally complex.
  - Pheromones play a role in attraction, influencing behavior below conscious awareness.
  - Vasopressin and genetic factors impact monogamy and pair-bonding.
  - Evolutionary perspective on love: intense infatuation peaks for about three years.
  - Divorce patterns align with this infatuation decline around four years.
- Parental Bonding and Infant Care:
  - Chemical signaling systems underlie social attachment.
  - Mice pups without specific receptors lose attachment to mothers.
  - Prairie voles' monogamous behavior linked to vasopressin and receptors.
  - Genetic variations in the vasopressin receptor affect pair-bonding in humans.
  - Evolutionarily, love and attachment serve reproduction and survival.
- Evolution of Traits:
  - Traits like large eyes and round faces in babies trigger caregiving responses.
  - Cuteness in infants enhances their survival by eliciting care.
- Consciousness and Self:
  - Conscious awareness is a small part of brain activity.

  - Exploring beyond one's "umwelt" reveals deeper layers of the brain.
  - Awareness of the complexity of the brain leads to a sense of awe.

## Why Blameworthiness Is The Wrong Question
- Neuroscientific Perspective on Behavior:
  - The notion of free will is challenged by growing understanding of brain mechanisms.
  - Decision-making processes and behaviors are strongly influenced by biological factors.
  - The brain's unconscious processes play a significant role in determining actions.
  - The conscious mind often rationalizes actions after they are already initiated by the unconscious.
- Criminal Behavior and Brain Abnormality:
  - There is a shift towards understanding the connection between biology and decision making.
  - Criminal behavior is seen as linked to brain abnormalities and not solely volitional choices.
  - Actions of criminals can be considered evidence of brain abnormality, even when details are unknown.
- Rethinking Punishment and Culpability:
  - The concept of culpability is questioned in light of brain science.
  - A forward-looking legal system is suggested, focusing on societal protection and rehabilitation.
  - Sentencing should be based on the risk of reoffending and individual modifiability.
  - Actuarial approaches, incorporating various factors, are more predictive than intuition in determining reoffense risk.
- Prefrontal Workout and Rehabilitation:
  - The prefrontal workout aims to enhance impulse control and decision making.
  - Brain plasticity allows individuals to develop better long-term decision-making abilities.
  - Rehabilitation focuses on promoting reflection and socialization, rather than just punishment.
  - The approach leverages neuroplasticity to enhance control over impulsive thoughts and behaviors.
- Modifiability and Sentencing:
  - Sentencing should align with an individual's modifiability, focusing on rehabilitation.
  - Different individuals have varying capacities for change and impulse control.
  - A fair approach is to provide punishment for those who can be modified and incapacitation for those who can't.
- Replacing Blameworthiness with Modifiability:
  - Blameworthiness is seen as an inadequate concept in legal systems.
  - Modifiability becomes a forward-looking term to assess rehabilitation potential.
  - A focus on evidence-based, neurally compatible social policy is proposed.
  - The ultimate goal is to shape legal theory based on scientific understanding of behavior.
- Ethical Considerations:
  - The ethical concern about scientific sentencing is countered by the question of alternatives.
  - Psychoactive drugs replaced lobotomy as a more expedient approach to mental health issues.
