**Author**: Tony Perrottet | **Year**: 2011 | **Category**: History & Biography

## Summary
"The Sinner's Grand Tour" is a hilarious and eye-opening journey through Europe's hidden sexual history, as Australian historian Tony Perrottet drags his family across the continent to uncover the raunchy relics that polite society has tried to forget. What begins as a scholarly quest to visit the British Museum's secret erotica collection evolves into a three-month European adventure hunting down historical sex clubs, Vatican pornographic bathrooms, and ancient Roman brothels—all while managing two young children and a bemused wife.

This book perfectly balances meticulous historical research with laugh-out-loud family travel mishaps, revealing that our ancestors were far more sexually adventurous than we ever imagined. Perrottet's journey demonstrates that the gap between historical respectability and historical reality is often filled with phallus-shaped charms, orgiastic clubs, and popes who commissioned erotic art.

Perfect for history buffs who want their education served with a heavy dose of humor, travelers who enjoy the bizarre side of cultural exploration, and anyone who suspects that "the good old days" weren't nearly as good as we've been led to believe.

## Core Insights

### The Victorian Censorship Machine Created the Forbidden History We Crave
The Victorian era's obsessive censorship ironically created the very "secret histories" that fascinate us today. The British Museum's Secretum, established in 1866 to protect the public from historical "obscenity," became a pilgrimage site for discerning gentlemen wanting to peek at 1,100+ "wicked objects" including Greco-Roman erotic art, medieval chastity belts, and Renaissance pornography. When moral panics suppress natural human behavior, they don't eliminate it—they just drive it underground and make it more intriguing.

> "Today, the entire continent is still littered with secret boudoirs, perverse relics, and ancient dungeons, many of which, I was convinced, could be found."

**Quick Take**: Censorship always backfires, creating forbidden knowledge that becomes more valuable precisely because it's suppressed.

### The Enlightenment Made Sex Clubs Sophisticated
The 18th century wasn't just about philosophy and revolution—it was Europe's golden age of organized debauchery. Hellfire clubs proliferated across Britain, attracting the era's finest intellectuals alongside its most profligate rakes. These weren't crude gatherings but sophisticated societies with their own rituals, special regalia, and elaborate ceremonies. Members voted using wooden boxes modeled on inverted human torsos (with votes deposited in appropriate orifices) and enjoyed "posture molls" who were the Georgian version of lap dancers. The clubs reflected Enlightenment ideals that sex could be pursued for pleasure rather than procreation, combined with newfound scientific curiosity and interest in world religions.

> "There was a gusto about 18th century vice unmatched before or since."

**Quick Take**: When societies intellectualize natural human desires, they create elaborate social structures that normalize and elevate rather than eliminate them.

### The Vatican Hides More Interesting History Than It Suppresses
The Renaissance Papacy was anything but the pious institution we imagine today. Renaissance popes were princes first, men of God second, living in Babylonian opulence with courtesans, siring children, and dying more often from syphilis than natural causes. The Vatican's most famous secret room is Raphael's Stufetta del Bibbiena—a bathroom covered with erotic frescoes commissioned by Cardinal Bibbiena in 1516, featuring entangled lovers, priapic satyrs, and curvaceous goddesses. The Church's later attempts to suppress this history created the very mysteries that fuel conspiracy theories and sensationalist fiction.

> "In the heart of the pope's private residence, a bathroom was covered with erotic paintings by Raphael."

**Quick Take**: Institutions that try to rewrite their history inevitably make their past more interesting than their present.

### Capri Has Been Europe's Hedonistic Playground for 2,000 Years
The island of Capri has served as Europe's premier escape for sexual libertarians since Emperor Tiberius retired there in 27 AD. What began as Tiberius's alleged "perverted bacchanals with experts in unnatural acts" evolved through the centuries into a haven for expatriate artists, exiled revolutionaries, and Europe's first openly gay community after Oscar Wilde's 1895 trial. The island's tradition of "la courtoisie" (the courtesy) meant shocking proposals were met with a shrug, creating a paradise where pagan values consistently trumped Christian morality under the warm Mediterranean sun.

> "Every sexual libertarian in the West made his or her way to its shores, where paganism soundly trumped austere Christian morality."

**Quick Take**: Geography often shapes culture more than ideology—beautiful islands create their own moral universes.

### Ancient Romans Were More Sexually Progressive Than Modern Americans
The archaeological discoveries at Pompeii and Herculaneum revealed a culture comfortable with sexuality in ways that would shock many modern Western societies. Romans displayed graphic erotic art in their homes, considered giant phalluses comic rather than offensive, and had organized prostitution that included numbered cubicles with visual menus of sexual positions. While Roman sexuality was complicated by social status issues (the "He-Who-Must-Insert Rule"), their acceptance of diverse sexual expressions and use of phallic imagery as protection against the evil eye suggests a sophistication we've yet to fully reclaim.

> "Here I fucked many girls" (actual graffiti found in Pompeii)

**Quick Take**: Progressive ideas about sexuality aren't modern inventions—they're rediscoveries of attitudes our ancestors took for granted.

## Best Quotes

- "I had been fondling another woman's pubic hair. Her eyes lit up. 'Cool,' she said. 'Whose?'"

## Action Items
- **Visit historical sites with an open mind**: Look beyond the official plaques and sanitized descriptions to imagine the real human dramas that unfolded there
- **Question the "official" version of history**: Remember that what's been preserved and promoted often reflects the values of censors rather than the reality of daily life
- **Embrace the messy reality of human nature**: Understand that human beings have always been complicated creatures capable of both high-minded philosophy and base desires—often simultaneously
- **Travel with curiosity about the forbidden**: The most interesting historical insights often lie in what societies tried to hide rather than what they chose to display

## Questions to Consider
- If future historians judged our era by what we censor rather than what we celebrate, what would they conclude about us?
- How much of what we consider "traditional values" are actually relatively recent inventions designed to suppress natural human behavior?
- What aspects of contemporary life will future generations find hilariously repressed about our current attitudes toward sexuality and morality?

## Conclusion
"The Sinner's Grand Tour" is that rare book that's simultaneously educational, hilarious, and genuinely thought-provoking. Perrottet manages the impressive feat of making serious historical scholarship feel like a raucous adventure with your funniest friend. The book's greatest strength isn't just its wealth of fascinating historical details, but its central thesis: human nature hasn't changed nearly as much as our public morality would suggest.

What makes this book essential reading is its ability to shatter our sanitized view of the past while making us laugh at the absurdity of historical censorship. By dragging his family through Europe's ribald relics, Perrottet reminds us that the gap between public respectability and private behavior has always been enormous—and probably always will be.

This is absolutely worth your time if you enjoy history with attitude, travel writing with substance, or simply want to feel better about humanity's enduring capacity for hypocrisy and humor. The biggest reason to read it? It's the rare history book that will make you both smarter and more amused about the human condition.
