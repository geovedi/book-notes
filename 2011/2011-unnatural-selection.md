# Unnatural Selection: Choosing Boys Over Girls, and the Consequences of a World Full of Men
**Author**: Mara Hvistendahl | **Year**: 2011 | **Category**: Health & Medicine

## Summary
Unnatural Selection reveals how Western population control programs and medical technologies led to the disappearance of an estimated 160 million females, primarily in Asia and Eastern Europe. Hvistendahl traces the origins of sex selection from 1960s American population control advocates who promoted sex determination as a tool for reducing birth rates, to the modern consequences of societies overwhelmed with men. The book exposes how well-intentioned efforts to combat overpopulation resulted in a gender imbalance that threatens social stability across multiple continents.

This meticulously researched investigation is essential for readers interested in public health, human rights, demographics, and the unintended consequences of technological and policy interventions. It reveals how decisions made in Western laboratories and policy circles decades ago continue to shape lives and societies today.

## Core Insights

### The Western Origins of Sex Selection
Sex selection technology wasn't adopted from traditional practices—it was exported to the developing world by Western population control programs. In the 1960s and 70s, influential American scientists and organizations, including Planned Parenthood and the Population Council, actively promoted and funded sex determination research as a solution to overpopulation. Paul Ehrlich, author of "The Population Bomb," suggested that if parents could guarantee male births first, "population control problems in many areas would be somewhat eased."

> "If a simple method could be found to guarantee that first-born children were males, then population control problems in many areas would be somewhat eased." — Paul Ehrlich, The Population Bomb

**Quick Take**: Technology developed to help families avoid sex-linked diseases was repurposed for population control, with devastating consequences.

### The Technology Transfer
The transfer of sex determination technology to Asia was deliberate and well-funded. American organizations like the Population Council and Ford Foundation sponsored research and training programs that introduced amniocentesis and ultrasound to countries like India, China, and South Korea. These technologies were presented as modern family planning tools, but their primary use became identifying and aborting female fetuses. By the 1980s, sex-selective abortion clinics were common across Asia, often operating openly.

> "In India the connection was especially stark, as Western aid money helped launch the very technology that would eventually lead to the abortion of millions of girls."

**Quick Take**: International development aid accelerated the gender imbalance by funding technologies without considering their social implications.

### The Scale of Loss
An estimated 160 million females are "missing" from the world population due to sex selection—more than all the women killed in all wars in the 20th century. This represents 4.4% of the world's female population. In some regions, the sex ratio at birth has reached alarming levels: 120 boys per 100 girls in parts of China, 125 in parts of India, and even higher in specific provinces. The imbalance is most severe among educated, urban middle and upper classes who have best access to technology.

> "Nature dictates that slightly more males than females are born... The natural human sex ratio at birth is 105 boys to 100 girls. But by the early 2000s the ratio in China had climbed to 120 boys per 100 girls."

**Quick Take**: The gender imbalance is largest among the most privileged classes, contradicting explanations based solely on poverty or lack of education.

### Social Consequences
The surplus of men has created profound social instability across affected regions. Consequences include increased human trafficking (women bought and sold as brides), rising rates of prostitution and sexual violence, and the emergence of "bare branches"—men who will never marry due to lack of available women. Research shows that societies with excess men experience higher rates of crime and social unrest. China and India now face a "marriage squeeze" that affects millions of men.

> "You can buy a Vietnamese bride for $11,000, a North Korean for $8,000. These women are not just purchased—they are often resold, trapped in cycles of exploitation."

**Quick Take**: Gender imbalance creates social instability that affects everyone, not just those directly involved in sex selection.

### The Return to the West
Having exported sex selection technology, Western societies are now embracing it through different means. While Americans generally claim to prefer girls (80% of sex selection patients request female embryos), the underlying dynamic remains the same—treating children as commodities to be designed to parental specifications. Technologies like PGD (Preimplantation Genetic Diagnosis) and MicroSort now allow parents to select for sex without abortion, often at costs of $12,000-18,000 per cycle.

> "Decades after America's elite pushed sex selection on the developing world, they have taken it up themselves."

**Quick Take**: The same technological imperative that led to sex selection in Asia is now operating in Western fertility clinics, despite different gender preferences.

### The Ethical Failure
The book documents a comprehensive failure of ethical oversight from scientists, population control advocates, and policymakers. Many researchers focused narrowly on technical capabilities without considering societal impacts. Population control advocates prioritized demographic targets over individual rights and social stability. Even critics who warned about consequences were often ignored or silenced. This ethical vacuum allowed destructive technologies to spread without adequate safeguards.

> "Time and again the scientists I interviewed blamed society for misuse of their inventions, never considering that they, as inventors, might bear some responsibility."

**Quick Take**: Technological innovation without ethical consideration creates predictable but preventable harm.

## Best Quotes

- "160 million females are missing from Asia's population—more than all the women killed in all the wars in the 20th century."

- "The problem with sex selection is not just that it eliminates girls; it's that it changes the value of everyone, including the boys who are born."

- "Americans, like Asians and Eastern Europeans, have a particular preference in babies. And when doctors justify sex selection they point to that preference: what happens in America is different because it is not driven by patriarchy—in America, we want girls."

- "You can choose whether to be a parent. But once you choose to be a parent you cannot choose whether it's a boy or girl, black or white, tall or short." — Dr. Puneet Bedi

- "The traditional order has only been upended in the United States, where a shift in gender preferences barely makes a dent in the global imbalance."

## Key Takeaways

- **Question technological interventions** in human reproduction that treat children as products to be designed rather than humans to be welcomed

- **Recognize global interconnections**—technologies and policies developed in one country can have devastating effects elsewhere

- **Support ethical oversight** of scientific research that considers social implications, not just technical capabilities

- **Advocate for girls' education and rights** as the most effective solution to son preference and gender discrimination

- **Challenge commodification** of children through assisted reproductive technologies that select for non-medical traits

- **Support organizations** working against human trafficking and marriage exploitation in affected regions

- **Promote policies** that value all children regardless of gender, both domestically and internationally

## Questions to Consider

1. How do Western societies bear responsibility for the gender imbalance in Asia given their role in developing and promoting sex selection technologies?

2. What are the ethical obligations of scientists when their inventions have predictable social consequences?

3. How might the global gender imbalance affect international relations, migration patterns, and economic development in coming decades?

4. Can the preference for "designer babies" in Western fertility clinics be ethically distinguished from sex selection practices in Asia?

5. What role should international organizations play in regulating reproductive technologies that affect demographic balance?

6. How might the "marriage squeeze" in China and India reshape family structures and social stability in coming generations?

7. What parallels exist between historical population control policies and current approaches to climate change and resource management?

## Conclusion

Unnatural Selection is a powerful exposé of how well-intentioned population control policies, combined with unchecked scientific innovation, led to one of the most significant demographic shifts in human history. Hvistendahl's meticulous research demonstrates that the gender imbalance sweeping through Asia and Eastern Europe is not a traditional practice or cultural accident, but the direct result of Western technological and policy interventions.

The book serves as both a historical account and a cautionary tale about the dangers of treating human reproduction as an engineering problem to be solved rather than a complex social reality to be respected. As new reproductive technologies continue to emerge, the lessons from sex selection become increasingly relevant: scientific capabilities without ethical wisdom can create harm that extends across generations and continents.

This is essential reading for anyone concerned with human rights, public health, demographic policy, or the ethical implications of reproductive technologies. It challenges us to consider how our desire for control over nature can have unintended consequences that reshape societies in profound and troubling ways. The disappearance of 160 million women is not just a statistic—it's a warning about the future we create when we treat human life as a problem to be managed rather than a gift to be cherished.
