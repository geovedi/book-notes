# Unfamiliar Fishes
**Author**: Sarah Vowell | **Year**: 2011

## Summary
Sarah Vowell's "Unfamiliar Fishes" is a witty, deeply researched exploration of how Hawaii transformed from an independent kingdom into America's 50th state. Spanning the 78 years between the arrival of New England missionaries in 1820 and formal annexation in 1898, Vowell uncovers the complex story of Americanization through her signature blend of historical rigor and personal commentary.

The book illuminates how "soft power"—cultural, religious, and economic influence—paved the way for eventual political takeover. Vowell traces how Protestant missionaries, their children (the "missionary boys"), and American sugar planters gradually transformed Hawaiian society, introducing Christianity, capitalism, and constitutional government while the native Hawaiian population was devastated by disease and cultural disruption.

Readers interested in American history, colonialism, and cultural identity will discover how Hawaii's story reflects broader American contradictions—a nation built on both destruction of indigenous peoples and immigrant opportunity, where a "plate lunch" of cultures can both enrich and erase. Vowell's personal connections (Cherokee ancestry) and contemporary parallels (Iraq invasion) make this historical narrative urgently relevant.

## Core Insights

### The Missionary Project and Its Unexpected Consequences
The first New England missionaries arrived in 1819 with sincere intentions to Christianize Hawaiians, but their influence extended far beyond religion. They created a written Hawaiian language, translated the Bible, and introduced Western education. However, their children—the "missionary boys"—would abandon evangelism for commerce, becoming sugar planters and businessmen who ultimately orchestrated the overthrow of the Hawaiian monarchy. Vowell shows how the missionaries' cultural "soft power" created the foundation for later economic and political domination.

> "This book tells the story of how Americans and their children spent the seventy-eight years between the arrival of Protestant missionaries in 1820 and the American annexation in 1898 Americanizing Hawaii, importing our favorite religion, capitalism, and our second-favorite religion, Christianity."

**Quick Take**: Cultural influence often precedes political control—today's soft power becomes tomorrow's hard power.

### The Sugar Plantation Economy and Demographic Transformation
The sugar industry, founded by missionary descendants, fundamentally reshaped Hawaii's population and culture. Needing labor for plantations, plantation owners imported workers from China, Japan, Korea, Portugal, and the Philippines, transforming Hawaii from a predominantly native Hawaiian society into a multiethnic mosaic where every group became a minority. This created the famous "plate lunch" culture—a metaphor for Hawaii's complex identity where Japanese rice, macaroni salad, and Hawaiian kalua pig coexist.

> "Sugar plantation workers used to share food at lunchtime, swapping tofu and Chinese noodles for Korean spareribs and Portuguese bread. That habit of hodgepodge got passed down, evolving into the plate lunch now served at diners, drive-ins, and lunch trucks throughout the Hawaiian archipelago."

**Quick Take**: Economic systems create demographic realities that persist long after the original economic rationale disappears.

### The Overthrow and Annexation as "Regime Change"
Vowell draws chilling parallels between the 1893 overthrow of Queen Liliuokalani and contemporary American interventions. The coup was led by American businessmen with support from U.S. Marines, and annexation was justified as bringing "civilization" and "self-government" to people who didn't want it. The same rhetoric used to justify taking Hawaii would later justify the Philippine occupation and even the 2003 Iraq invasion.

> "The subtext of the dissent was: This is not who we are. But not if you were standing where I was. It was hard to see the look in that palace tour guide's eyes when she talked about the American flag flying over the palace and not realize that ever since 1898, from time to time, this is exactly who we are."

**Quick Take**: American expansion has consistently followed patterns of economic interest followed by military intervention and political justification.

### The Paradox of Hawaiian Identity
Hawaii represents America's dual nature as both oppressor and haven for immigrants. Vowell, herself of Cherokee and Swedish descent, sees Hawaii's story as America's story—a place where native loss and immigrant opportunity coexist. The "plate lunch" metaphor captures this complexity: cultures mix and blend, but this mixing often comes at the cost of the original native culture that made the mixing possible.

> "Growing up, I came to know America as two places—a rapacious country built on the destruction of its original inhabitants, and a welcoming land of opportunity and generosity built by people who shared their sausage and their cheese."

**Quick Take**: Cultural fusion can be both beautiful and tragic, especially when it occurs alongside indigenous displacement.

## Best Quotes
- "Whenever I eat plate lunch, I always think back to the lore of my Swedish great-grandfather's voyage across the Atlantic. Supposedly, the only food he brought with him on the ship was a big hunk of cheese. Then he befriended a German in steerage whose only food was a big hunk of sausage. The Swede shared his cheese with the German and the German shared his sausage with the Swede."
- "It is laughable to think that a lava rock temple—built at least a century before the Declaration of Independence was signed five thousand miles away—has much to do with the history of the United States."
- "The serious resentment lurking in those words—this is our wave—gets to the heart of the whole history of Hawaii's losing battle to ward off foreign intruders."

## Action Items
- **Visit historical sites with critical awareness**: When visiting places like Iolani Palace or historical monuments, consider both the official narrative and the perspectives of those who were displaced or marginalized
- **Examine the "soft power" influences in your own community**: How are cultural, educational, and religious institutions shaping values and behaviors in ways that might serve economic or political interests?
- **Recognize contemporary patterns of historical processes**: Identify modern examples of cultural influence preceding economic or political control in globalization, business, or international relations
- **Engage with native perspectives**: Actively seek out and listen to indigenous voices, especially when their stories contradict mainstream historical narratives

## Questions to Consider
- How does the story of Hawaii's annexation reflect current American foreign policy and intervention patterns?
- In what ways does "soft power" (cultural, educational, religious influence) operate in your community or workplace?
- How can we acknowledge both the tragedy of native Hawaiian loss and the genuine opportunities Hawaii provided to immigrant groups?
- What responsibility do current beneficiaries of historical injustices have to address those wrongs?
- How does the "plate lunch" metaphor apply to other cultural fusion scenarios you've experienced?

## Conclusion
"Unfamiliar Fishes" is essential reading for understanding American expansionism's complex legacy. Vowell masterfully shows how Hawaii's transformation from sovereign kingdom to American state encapsulates broader American contradictions—our capacity for both cultural generosity and territorial greed, for genuine democratic ideals and hypocritical applications of those ideals.

The book's greatest strength is how Vowell connects Hawaii's specific story to universal American patterns of expansion and identity formation. Her personal stake as a Cherokee descendant, combined with her sharp wit and deep research, makes this historical narrative feel urgently contemporary.

**Is this worth your time?** Absolutely. In under 300 pages, Vowell provides more insight into American identity and expansion than many scholarly works twice the length. Her engaging narrative style and piercing analysis make complex historical processes accessible and memorable. The biggest reason to read this book is understanding how the past continues to shape present-day debates about American power, cultural identity, and our ongoing struggle to reconcile our ideals with our actions.
