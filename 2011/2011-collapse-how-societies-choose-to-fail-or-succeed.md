# Collapse: How Societies Choose to Fail or Succeed
**Author**: Jared Diamond | **Year**: 2011 | **Category**: Science & Nature

## Summary
Jared Diamond's "Collapse" investigates why ancient and modern societies have collapsed or survived when facing environmental crises. Using a comparative method, Diamond examines past societies like Easter Island, the Maya, Norse Greenland, and the Anasazi alongside modern cases such as Rwanda, China, and Australia. He argues that environmental destruction, combined with climate change, hostile neighbors, loss of trade partners, and crucially, a society's response to these challenges, determines whether a society thrives or fails.

This book is essential reading for anyone concerned about environmental sustainability, global climate change, and the future of our civilization. Diamond provides a framework for understanding how societies make disastrous decisions—and how we might avoid repeating their mistakes.

## Core Insights

### The Five-Point Framework for Understanding Collapse
Diamond identifies five key factors that determine whether a society will collapse or survive:

1. **Environmental damage** - Deforestation, soil erosion, water problems, overhunting, overfishing, and human population growth
2. **Climate change** - Natural or human-induced shifts that stress societies already struggling with environmental damage
3. **Hostile neighbors** - Military pressure that exploits environmental weaknesses
4. **Loss of friendly trade partners** - Economic isolation when trading societies collapse
5. **Society's response** - How leaders and institutions adapt (or fail to adapt) to environmental challenges

The fifth factor—societal response—is always crucial and can make the difference between survival and collapse.

### Why Societies Make Disastrous Decisions

Diamond explains how societies fail to address existential threats through a sequence of failures:

**Failure to anticipate problems** often happens when societies lack prior experience with similar challenges. Vikings in Iceland assumed the light volcanic soils would behave like Norway's heavy clay soils, leading to massive soil erosion when they cleared the forests.

**Failure to perceive problems** occurs through "landscape amnesia" and "creeping normalcy"—gradual changes that people fail to notice because they happen slowly. Montana residents didn't notice their glaciers disappearing over decades because the change was too gradual to trigger alarm.

**Rational bad behavior** occurs when individuals or groups benefit from decisions that harm society as a whole. Diamond calls this the "tragedy of the commons"—each person acting rationally in their self-interest creates collective disaster. Mining companies leaving toxic waste behind after extracting profits exemplify this pattern.

**Conflicts of interest** between elites and the masses frequently lead to collapse. Maya kings and Easter Island chiefs pursued prestige projects (massive monuments and statues) that accelerated deforestation because they couldn't afford to appear weak to their rivals.

**Core values** can become deadly when circumstances change. Greenland Norse refused to adopt Inuit survival techniques because it would mean abandoning their Christian European identity—even as they starved in the harsh climate.

### Case Studies of Failure and Success

**Easter Island** represents the classic "pure" ecological collapse. The society completely deforested their island to move massive stone statues, leading to soil erosion, crop failure, warfare, cannibalism, and eventual population collapse of 90%. The famous question Diamond's students asked—"What did the man who cut down the last tree say?"—illustrates how landscape amnesia prevented islanders from recognizing their ecological crisis until it was too late.

**Norse Greenland** offers the most complex case study of a literate European society that survived for 450 years in harsh conditions before collapsing around 1450. The Norse maintained their European identity, refused to learn from the Inuit (who thrived in the same environment), overgrazed their fragile lands, and relied on declining trade with Norway when sea ice increased and elephant ivory replaced walrus ivory in European markets.

**The Maya** civilization collapsed around 900 AD due to a combination of deforestation, soil erosion, population growth, and severe drought. Maya kings competed to build larger monuments, accelerating deforestation while refusing to address the underlying environmental crisis.

**Success stories** provide hope: **Tokugawa Japan** implemented top-down forest management and population control to prevent ecological collapse. **Tikopia Island** adopted bottom-up solutions, including eliminating destructive pigs and practicing careful resource management for 3,000 years. **Iceland** recovered from near-total ecological devastation to become one of the world's wealthiest nations through careful environmental stewardship.

### Modern Applications

Diamond examines contemporary societies facing similar challenges:

**Rwanda's genocide** emerged from population pressure on scarce land resources, creating competition that exploded into ethnic violence when climate change brought drought.

**The Dominican Republic** and **Haiti** demonstrate how different policies in identical environments can lead to vastly different outcomes. Haiti's deforestation (98% forest loss) contrasts sharply with the Dominican Republic's forest preservation (28% forest cover), largely due to leadership decisions.

**China** faces all twelve of Diamond's modern environmental problems simultaneously, but its authoritarian government can implement sweeping changes when motivated—such as their aggressive family planning policies and renewable energy investments.

**Australia** occupies the most fragile environment of any First World country and is considering the most radical societal restructuring to address ecological limits.

## Best Quotes

- "The processes through which past societies have undermined themselves by damaging their environments fall into eight categories: deforestation and habitat destruction, soil problems, water management problems, overhunting, overfishing, effects of introduced species, human population growth, and increased per-capita impact of people."

- "What did the Easter Islander who cut down the last palm tree say as he was doing it?...Gradually, Easter Island's trees became fewer, smaller, and less important. At the time that the last fruit-bearing adult palm tree was cut, the species had long ago ceased to be of any economic significance."

- "Landscape amnesia provided part of the answer...Only the oldest islanders, thinking back to their childhoods decades earlier, could have recognized a difference. Their children could no more have comprehended their parents' tales of a tall forest than my 17-year-old sons today can comprehend my wife's and my tales of what Los Angeles used to be like 40 years ago."

- "It's someone else's problem"—the dangerous assumption that allows societies to ignore growing crises until it's too late.

- "Perhaps a crux of success or failure as a society is to know which core values to hold on to, and which ones to discard and replace with new values, when times change."

## Action Items

- **Watch for creeping normalcy**: Pay attention to gradual environmental changes that others dismiss as insignificant

- **Avoid landscape amnesia**: Compare current conditions with those of decades past to recognize long-term trends

- **Challenge conflicts of interest**: Question policies that benefit elite groups while harming the broader society

- **Reexamine core values**: Ask whether traditional practices still make sense in changed circumstances

- **Think long-term**: Consider how today's decisions will affect future generations, not just immediate profits

- **Study success stories**: Learn from societies that successfully managed their environmental challenges

- **Recognize early warning signs**: Don't wait for crises to become obvious before taking action

## Questions to Consider

- What environmental problems are we currently failing to anticipate due to lack of prior experience?

- Where is "creeping normalcy" preventing us from recognizing serious threats in our society?

- How might our current "rational" economic decisions be creating collective disasters?

- Which of our core values might need to be abandoned to ensure survival?

- Are there modern cases where elites are insulated from the consequences of their decisions?

- How can we better balance short-term needs with long-term sustainability?

- What warning signs from past collapses are we ignoring today?

## Conclusion

"Collapse" is absolutely worth your time—it's a powerful warning about the fragility of civilization and a hopeful guide to avoiding ecological disaster. Diamond's framework helps us understand why some societies fail while others succeed, providing crucial insights for addressing today's environmental challenges.

The biggest reason to read this book is its timely relevance: our global civilization faces many of the same pressures that destroyed past societies, but on a much larger scale. Diamond's comparative method reveals patterns of decision-making that apply across time and culture, making this not just a history book but a practical guide to navigating our own environmental crisis.

While the book may seem pessimistic about past failures, Diamond emphasizes that collapse is not inevitable. His detailed analysis of successful societies shows that intelligent adaptation and courageous leadership can overcome even severe environmental challenges. The book leaves us with both warning and hope: we face serious threats, but we have the knowledge to avoid repeating past mistakes—if we choose to use it.
