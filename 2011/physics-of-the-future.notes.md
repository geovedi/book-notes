Author: Michio Kaku

## Introduction: Predicting The Next 100 Years
- Predictions of the Past:
  - Many past predictions about the future have failed to materialize.
  - Examples include the "peopleless city," demise of traditional media, and paperless office.
  - These predictions failed due to the "Cave Man Principle."
- Cave Man Principle:
  - Human desires and behaviors have changed little over 100,000 years.
  - Modern technology often conflicts with primitive desires.
  - People prefer hard copies, face-to-face encounters, and physical experiences.
- Media Evolution:
  - New media coexists with old media; no medium entirely replaces another.
  - Live theater, radio, TV, and online media all coexist.
- Human Social Interactions:
  - Human social interactions reflect ancient tribal behaviors.
  - Gossip, social networking, and entertainment are vital.
  - Online social networking and celebrity culture exemplify this.
- Future Power of Technology:
  - Technology's power will increase rapidly in the future.
  - The movie "Forbidden Planet" warns of the dangers of unchecked power.
  - Science is a double-edged sword, creating and solving problems.
- Global Trends:
  - Competing trends: planetary civilization vs. anarchy and ignorance.
  - Sectarian and fundamentalist passions persist with modern weaponry.
  - Transition from observers to choreographers to conservators of nature.
