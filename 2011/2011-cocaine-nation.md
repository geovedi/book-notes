# Cocaine Nation
**Author**: Tom Feiling | **Year**: 2011

## Summary
Cocaine Nation reveals how the global cocaine trade has evolved from an obscure botanical curiosity into a multi-billion dollar industry that connects Colombian coca farmers with Western consumers. Through firsthand reporting from the trade routes connecting London, New York, Miami, Kingston, Tijuana, and Colombia, Feiling exposes the devastating failure of the war on drugs and makes a compelling case for legalization. The book demonstrates how prohibition has created more problems than it solved—fueling violence, corruption, and environmental destruction while failing to reduce cocaine consumption.

This book is essential reading for anyone interested in drug policy reform, international development, or understanding the hidden economics behind one of the world's most lucrative illegal commodities. You'll gain a nuanced understanding of why the current approach has failed and what alternatives might actually work.

## Core Insights

### The Prohibition Paradox
The war on drugs has backfired spectacularly. Instead of eliminating cocaine, prohibition has created a criminal enterprise that generates enormous profits while avoiding taxes. A kilogram that sells for £655 in Colombia commands £23,845 in Europe—a markup of over 3,500%. These profits fuel violence, corruption, and environmental destruction while doing nothing to reduce demand. The irony is that legalization would actually give governments more control over cocaine than they currently have.

> "The prohibition of drugs has created drug neighbourhoods, drug dealers and drug violence."

**Quick Take**: Criminalizing drugs doesn't eliminate demand—it just creates criminal organizations to service it.

### The Economics of Failure
The global cocaine trade is worth approximately £50 billion annually—less than 1% of America's GDP and trivial compared to total global trade. Despite decades of interdiction efforts, cocaine prices in Europe reached record lows in 2008, indicating abundant supply. The war on drugs costs billions while creating the very problems it claims to solve: 80% of drug-related murders are actually business disputes, not crimes committed by people under the influence.

> "In 2004, a kilogram of cocaine typically sold for £655 in Colombia. Once smuggled north into Mexico, it was worth £3,940. Once over the border and into the United States, it would sell for £11,750."

**Quick Take**: The economics of prohibition guarantee failure—huge profits create irresistible incentives for suppliers.

### The Racial Realities of Drug Enforcement
Drug use crosses all racial and class boundaries, but enforcement doesn't. In the United States, 80% of cocaine consumers are white, yet drug law enforcement focuses disproportionately on minority communities in inner cities. African-Americans make up just 12% of drug users but 59% of those convicted for drug offenses. Similar patterns exist in the UK, where black communities face higher levels of policing and harsher sentencing.

> "Eighty per cent of the cocaine in the United States is consumed by white people, yet police operations and drug-treatment programmes have focused on poor, inner-city neighbourhoods, typically inhabited by minority populations."

**Quick Take**: Drug enforcement reflects racial bias more than actual patterns of drug use.

### The Success Stories of Legalization
Switzerland's prescription heroin program has reduced crimes committed by drug addicts by up to 90% while doubling employment rates. When cocaine was depenalized in Amsterdam, usage rates remained unchanged—price had little bearing on consumption patterns. These examples demonstrate that regulated legal markets can be more effective at reducing drug-related harm than prohibition.

> "In Switzerland, prescription programmes that have been doing just that for the past ten years have been instrumental in reducing the number of crimes committed by drug addicts by up to 90 per cent and doubling the numbers able to sustain full-time employment."

**Quick Take**: Legalization and regulation work better than prohibition at reducing drug-related harm.

### The Coca Plant's Lost Potential
The coca leaf itself has practically no adverse health effects according to a suppressed World Health Organization study. Coca products can help treat arthritis, diabetes, asthma, stomach ulcers, and period pain. Yet international treaties prohibit commercialization of coca products, denying farmers legitimate markets while forcing them into the cocaine trade. The irony is that Coca-Cola still imports coca leaves legally for flavoring their soft drinks.

> "In 1995, a World Health Organization study of coca and cocaine concluded that the coca leaf has practically no adverse effects on human health. The study was pulled after the United States' ambassador to the United Nations threatened to withdraw all funding for the WHO if its findings were published."

**Quick Take**: The coca plant has legitimate commercial potential that's being blocked by misguided drug policy.

## Best Quotes
- "The day after we got rid of that law, Al Capone and all his smuggling buddies went out of business. They were no longer out there killing one another, or killing us cops."
- "People look at it as a war on them, and frankly we're not at war with the people of this country."
- "The distinction between legal and illegal drugs is arbitrary and increasingly hard to maintain. Its main purpose seems to be to support a façade of nominal abstention behind which the United States dopes itself up to its collective eyeballs."
- "If the people of the United States had lived through the war on drugs that we've lived through, they'd already be pushing their government to change its stance."
- "At its worst, drug use is a vice, but it is not a crime."

## Action Items
- Support organizations working to end the war on drugs and promote evidence-based drug policy
- Educate yourself and others about the real effects of different drugs versus the propaganda
- Question assumptions about who uses drugs and who profits from the illegal drug trade
- Consider the environmental and human costs of your consumption choices
- Advocate for treating drug use as a public health issue rather than a criminal justice problem

## Questions to Consider
- If alcohol and tobacco cause more deaths than all illegal drugs combined, why are they legal while cocaine isn't?
- Why do we treat drug addiction as a moral failing rather than a health issue?
- How would regulated legalization actually work in practice?
- What would happen to drug-related violence if profits were removed from the equation?
- Are current drug policies really about public health, or are they about social control?

## Conclusion
Cocaine Nation is a devastating critique of fifty years of failed drug policy. Feiling demonstrates conclusively that the war on drugs has accomplished nothing except to create vast criminal enterprises, fuel violence and corruption, destroy environments, and disproportionately harm minority communities. The book's power lies in its combination of street-level reporting, economic analysis, and policy critique.

The biggest reason to read this book is that it challenges fundamental assumptions about drugs and drug policy that most people have never questioned. Feiling doesn't just criticize the current system—he offers evidence-based alternatives that have worked in practice. While he makes a compelling case for legalization, he's also realistic about the political challenges involved.

This book is worth your time because it connects the dots between the casual cocaine user at a London dinner party and the violence in Colombian coca-growing regions. It shows how well-intentioned policies can have catastrophic unintended consequences when based on ideology rather than evidence. Whether you agree with Feiling's conclusions or not, you'll never think about drug policy the same way again.
