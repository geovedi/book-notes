## Summary
This concise management guide applies Neuro-Linguistic Programming (NLP) principles to help professionals reclaim control over their most precious resource: time. Rather than offering rigid time management systems, the book teaches readers how to understand their personal working preferences, prepare themselves mentally and physically for tasks, and create flexible frameworks that work with their natural rhythms.

The guide is perfect for busy managers, professionals, and anyone feeling overwhelmed by modern workplace demands. Readers will gain practical strategies for planning effectively, handling interruptions, eliminating repetitive tasks, and managing their mental state to achieve peak performance while maintaining work-life balance.

## Core Insights

### Planning to Save Time
The book emphasizes that spending a small amount of time planning saves enormous amounts of time later. Start each day by identifying what's most important (not just urgent) for you to accomplish. This means distinguishing between external demands and your own priorities. The author suggests creating two lists: what you need to do and what you want to do, ensuring you remain human rather than robotic in your approach to work.

> "Selecting what's most important for you to do during that day... The emphasis being on 'what's most important' not 'what's most urgent,' not 'what others are demanding of you'"

**Quick Take**: Focus on importance over urgency. Take 5 minutes each morning to set your own priorities rather than reacting to others' demands.

### Resourcing Yourself for Peak Performance
Before tackling any task, prepare yourself by recalling a time when you completed similar work successfully. Pay attention to your physical position, tools used, environment, and thought patterns. Replicate those successful conditions in your present situation. This technique leverages NLP principles to put you in the optimal state for any task.

> "Begin to notice some of the things that actually helped you to write easily and effectively. By the way I know they're things that you don't usually think make any difference, like the position you are sitting in."

**Quick Take**: Success leaves clues. Before starting any task, recreate the conditions under which you've performed best in the past.

### Managing Interruptions and Other People
Other people represent the biggest time-wasting challenge. The book recommends setting clear time limits upfront: "I can give you five minutes." This approach helps others be more concise while preserving relationships. If timing is truly inconvenient, be direct about it and schedule alternative times rather than pretending to listen while multitasking.

> "There's nothing more irritating than someone who says that they're listening to you while they continue to work on their PC and are quite clearly concentrating on that rather than on what you are saying."

**Quick Take**: Set boundaries respectfully. Give people your full attention for a limited time, or reschedule when you can be truly present.

### Eliminating Repetition
Much time is wasted through repetitive actions like checking email multiple times daily or making separate phone calls to the same person. Instead, batch similar activities together: process email once or twice daily, collect all questions for colleagues before approaching them, and handle papers immediately rather than touching them multiple times.

> "It would make sense to say to yourself: 'What do I need to ask them about?' and collect the queries together so that you only have to make one phone call. What a saving of time that would be."

**Quick Take**: Batch similar tasks. Group emails, calls, and conversations to eliminate repetitive switching between activities.

### Managing Your Mental State
When you feel stuck or mentally blocked, don't force yourself to continue. Instead, switch to a different type of activity or take a physical break. Your unconscious mind will continue working on the problem while you distract your conscious mind. This explains why solutions often appear when you're doing something completely different.

> "Go and do something different, whatever appeals to you. Go and talk to somebody, do a crossword puzzle for a while or read the newspaper; anything which will distract your conscious mind."

**Quick Take**: Work with your mind's natural rhythms. When stuck, switch activities or move your body to unlock mental blocks.

## Best Quotes
- "If you have planned your day, thought about it carefully and arranged it in a way that suits your preference for working, then you have already done something that will help to set you up in the right state to use your time well."
- "There is nothing more satisfying than getting to the end of the day having crossed off your list all the things that you planned to do, and then done two or three more that you weren't actually intending to fit in today and managed to find the time for."
- "Be a little kind to yourself and work with yourself rather than against yourself and you'd be surprised how much easier it is to find that you can use your time well."
- "Make sure that fun is written in as well. It's essential to our well being and is all part of why we need to manage our time."
- "Just make it up in a way that you feel will help you to achieve that task simply."

## Action Items
- Start each day by identifying your 3 most important tasks (not urgent ones)
- Before starting any task, recall when you've done similar work successfully and replicate those conditions
- Set clear time boundaries when people approach you: "I have 5 minutes to discuss this"
- Batch email processing to 2-3 specific times daily rather than constant checking
- Collect all questions for colleagues before approaching them, making one visit instead of many
- When mentally blocked, switch to a different type of activity or take a walk
- End each day by noting what you accomplished rather than what's left undone

## Questions to Consider
- How much of your time is spent on things that are urgent but not truly important to you?
- What are your natural working preferences - when are you most creative, analytical, or social?
- Which repetitive actions could you batch together to save time?
- How can you better prepare yourself mentally and physically for important tasks?
- What boundaries do you need to set to protect your focus and priorities?

## Conclusion
This is absolutely worth your time if you feel overwhelmed by modern workplace demands and traditional time management systems haven't worked for you. The book's strength lies in its human-centered approach that works with your natural preferences rather than against them. The NLP techniques offer fresh perspectives on mental preparation and state management that you won't find in typical productivity books. The biggest reason to read this is its emphasis on self-compassion and working with yourself rather than against yourself—a revolutionary concept in productivity literature that could transform your relationship with time forever.
