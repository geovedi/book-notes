## What Uncle Sam Really Wants

### The Main Goals of US Foreign Policy
- Protecting our Turf:
  - Relations between the United States and other countries go back to the origins of American history.
  - World War II marked a watershed moment for the United States, benefiting enormously from the war's aftermath.
  - The US emerged from WWII as the first global power in history.
  - American planners, aware of this dominance, carefully planned how to shape the postwar world.
  - National security and control were achieved due to having 50% of the world's wealth and dominating both oceans.
  - US espionage network in Eastern Europe was established, absorbing Nazi collaborators, extending into Latin America.
- The Liberal Extreme:
  - George Kennan was a leading dove among US planners, shaping the postwar world.
  - Kennan's Policy Planning Study 23 highlighted the US's wealth disparity and the need to focus on immediate national objectives.
  - The call to abandon idealistic slogans in favor of power concepts emerged.
  - US planners aimed to combat "excessive liberalism" that allowed too much domestic dissent.
  - Kennan observed the need to protect raw materials in Latin America and combat the idea that governments should care for the people.
- The "Grand Area":
  - The concept of the "Grand Area" emerged in post-WWII planning.
  - The Grand Area was a region subordinated to the needs of the American economy, encompassing Western Hemisphere, Western Europe, the Far East, and more.
  - Industrial countries like Germany and Japan were to be guided by the US, while the Third World was to provide raw materials and markets.
  - Postwar planning sought to prevent ultranationalist regimes that might threaten the private investment interests.
  - The Vietnam War was driven by the need to maintain the service role of the Third World and suppress national independence examples.
- Restoring the Traditional Order:
  - Postwar planners, like Kennan, aimed to reconstruct Western industrial societies from wartime damage to maintain corporate dominance.
  - Right-wing order restoration was crucial: business dominance, weakened labor, reconstruction burden on working classes and poor.
  - Antifascist resistance posed a threat; it was suppressed worldwide, replacing with fascist and Nazi collaborators.
  - This suppression strategy involved extreme violence or softer methods like subverting elections and withholding food.
  - US supported dictatorial regimes and destroyed independent movements to prevent successful examples of national independence and social justice.
  - US-backed coups and interventions thwarted social democratic governments like Allende's Chile and Guatemala's reform efforts.
  - Weakest and poorest countries were seen as dangerous examples; success in these places could inspire larger countries to seek independence.
  - The real fear was the "good example" that could lead to the spread of social and economic development, challenging US corporate dominance.
- Our Commitment to Democracy:
  - US planners' primary concern was subduing Third World nationalism and maintaining private capitalist enterprise over democracy.
  - Democracy supported only if it safeguarded the interests of investors and allowed for control; opposition to democracy when it couldn't be controlled.
  - US opposed democracy in Latin America and other regions if it led to social reform or popular representation, fearing it could spread "rotten" ideas.
  - US interventions in countries like Nicaragua, El Salvador, and Guatemala aimed to suppress independent nationalism and popular movements.
  - The domino theory or "rotten apple theory" justified US interventions to prevent the spread of good examples of independent paths to development.
  - Documented cases like Chile, Guatemala, and Indochina highlight the US's suppression of democratic movements to maintain corporate and capitalist interests.
  - The fear of "good examples" and the spread of independent paths challenged US dominance and led to interventions, coups, and subversion.
- The Threat of a Good Example:
  - The fear of the "good example" is a recurring theme in US foreign policy.
  - The concern is that successful social and economic development in one country might inspire similar movements in neighboring nations.
  - The US aims to prevent such "ultranationalist" regimes that prioritize the needs of their own population from taking power.
  - The desire to maintain stability for upper classes and large foreign enterprises drives the suppression of good examples.
  - Even the smallest and weakest countries pose a threat if they succeed in creating a better life for their citizens.
  - The spread of social and economic development is viewed as a "rot" that must be eradicated before it influences other nations.
- The Three-Sided World:
  - The global economic landscape has shifted towards a trilateral structure with three major economic blocs.
  - One bloc centers around the yen with Japan as the core and its former colonies on the periphery.
  - The second bloc is based in Europe and led by Germany, with the consolidation of the European Common Market as a significant step.
  - The third bloc, dominated by the US and centered around the dollar, is being extended to include Canada, Mexico, and other parts of the hemisphere.
  - These blocs compete with each other in the global economic arena.
  - The US is determined to secure its dollar-based bloc, and this influences its foreign policy decisions in regions like Central America and the Caribbean.

### Evastation Abroad
- Our Good Neighbor Policy:
  - The United States, a dominant economic and military power, has historically utilized economic warfare as a weapon.
  - Economic measures such as embargoes and IMF rules have been employed, particularly against weaker nations.
  - The US, lacking the economic strength to impose global "order and stability," has turned to military dominance.
  - With the Soviet deterrent gone, the US now relies more heavily on its pre-eminent military power.
  - The US aims to establish the principle that force is the governing factor on the world stage.
  - The role of the US has shifted towards being a "rent-a-thug," using military might for wealthy powers' interests.
  - The financial editor of the Chicago Tribune has suggested a "mercenary role" for the US, selling protection services.
  - This perspective seeks to maintain US control over the world economic system and enforce its dominance.
- The Crucifixion of El Salvador:
  - The United States pursued military Keynesian policies, leading to excessive financial manipulation and consumption.
  - The US government and corporate sectors accumulated huge debts, while productive investment lagged.
  - The Pentagon system, including NASA and the Department of Energy, became integral to the US economy.
  - The state relied on inspiring fear of enemies and awe for leaders to divert the population's attention.
  - Threats like Qaddafi, Grenada, Sandinistas, Noriega, and Arabs were portrayed as menacing forces.
  - El Salvador was a victim of the US's "Good Neighbor policy," facing brutality and state terror.
  - The journal of Salvadoran Jesuits noted that Eastern European figures like Vaclav Havel faced different outcomes.
  - El Salvador suffered from US-backed violence and repression, contrasting with Eastern European peaceful uprisings.
  - The US's primary goal is maintaining power and domination, often at the expense of countries like El Salvador.
  - Economic warfare and military dominance serve as tools to enforce this agenda.
- Teaching Nicaragua a Lesson:
  - The US has regularly opposed diplomatic solutions and negotiations, favoring military force in conflicts.
  - Diplomacy is avoided, especially when US positions are unpopular, as seen in Southeast Asia and Central America.
  - The US has very little popular support for its goals in the Third World, which it seeks to control and exploit.
  - The US preferred using military force and sanctions in the Gulf crisis, with diplomacy as a secondary option.
  - US policy analysts express satisfaction with the increased freedom to use violence globally after the Cold War.
  - The US seeks to impose a capitalist model on the Third World, even as it resists such policies domestically.
  - The US is poised to benefit from conflicts settled through force, which plays to its strength.
  - The flow of profits from Gulf oil production aids the US's role as a "rent-a-thug," imposing dominance.
  - Japan, Germany, and European powers are expected to share the financial burden of maintaining global order.
  - Economic exploitation and dominance remain at the core of the US's approach to international affairs.
- Making Guatemala a Killing Field:
  - The United States was heavily involved in making Guatemala a "killing field" during the 1980s.
  - The U.S. backed a brutal government that carried out a violent campaign against indigenous Mayan communities.
  - The U.S. support for the Guatemalan military included arms, training, and financial aid.
  - The violence resulted in tens of thousands of deaths and countless human rights abuses.
  - The Reagan administration portrayed the Guatemalan government as a defender against communist insurgents, justifying its support.
- The Invasion of Panama:
  - The U.S. invaded Panama in December 1989 to remove its leader, Manuel Noriega.
  - The invasion was carried out under the pretext of protecting American lives and bringing Noriega to justice.
  - The invasion resulted in a significant number of civilian casualties and widespread destruction.
  - The U.S. disregarded international law and sovereignty in its unilateral action.
  - The real motivations were tied to maintaining control over the Panama Canal and asserting U.S. dominance in the region.
- Inoculating Southeast Asia:
  - The U.S. employed a strategy of "inoculating" Southeast Asia against the spread of communism during the Cold War.
  - This strategy involved using military force and interventions to prevent countries from embracing leftist or socialist ideologies.
  - The U.S. engaged in military conflicts in Vietnam, Laos, and Cambodia to suppress communist movements.
  - The strategy led to immense suffering, loss of life, and social upheaval in the region.
  - The U.S. pursued its goals even at the cost of civilian casualties and environmental destruction.
- The Gulf War:
  - The United Nations' functioning and its limitations, blocked by great powers and political correctness.
  - The UN's history of being vetoed by the United States and other powers in the Security Council.
  - UN sanctions against Iraq as a result of US pressure, indicating the rare occasion when the US allowed international intervention.
  - The deployment of a massive US-led military force to counter Iraq's invasion of Kuwait, undermining peaceful resolution possibilities.
  - The rejection of diplomatic negotiations by the US and its focus on military action.
  - US opposition to international conferences and resolutions that support Palestinian rights and self-determination.
  - The US's preference for violence as a means to resolve conflicts, often due to its superior military power.
  - The US's objectives in the Gulf War: control of energy resources, economic benefits, and reinforcing global dominance.
  - The lessons taught by the Gulf War: the world is ruled by force, diplomacy is avoided, and military strength prevails.
  - The suppression of information by the media regarding diplomatic initiatives and US actions during the Gulf War.
- The Iran/Contra Cover-up:
  - The background of arms sales to Iran through Israel, which began shortly after the fall of the Shah in 1979.
  - Israel's public role in providing arms to Iran, even with US cooperation.
  - The revelation of the Iran/Contra scandal due to incidents like the capture of Eugene Hasenfus and reports of US officials' actions in Teheran.
  - The connection between the Iran arms sales and the Contra war, known to some before the scandal's exposure.
  - The US's declining economic power relative to Japan and Germany while maintaining military dominance.
  - The adoption of military power as a major policy instrument, replacing economic warfare.
  - The US's "mercenary role," receiving payment for providing security services to other wealthy powers.
  - The diversion of resources into the Pentagon system, resulting in debt and lack of productive investment.
  - The role of fear and awe in diverting the population's attention from pressing social and economic issues.
  - The changing focus of perceived threats, from the Soviet Union to various figures and entities in the Third World.
- Prospects for Eastern Europe:
  - Events in Eastern Europe during the 1980s were unique due to the USSR's withdrawal of support, allowing popular movements to flourish.
  - USSR's encouragement of these movements stemmed from its internal necessities rather than altruism.
  - The relatively peaceful uprisings in Eastern Europe were exceptional in historical terms.
  - Eastern Europe's future appears grim as Western powers aim to exploit the region by turning it into an easily exploitable part of the Third World.
  - A new colonial relationship between Western and Eastern Europe is being reestablished.
  - Various global economic powers, including Germany, Japan, and the United States, compete to exploit Eastern Europe's resources and cheap labor.
  - The IMF system aims to impose the capitalist model on Eastern Europe, leading to increased exploitation and turning it into a kind of Brazil or Mexico.
  - The region's relatively high health and education standards are attractive to investors from racially biased societies.
  - Violence, poverty, malnutrition, and environmental destruction persist in Latin America, driven by economic policies and state terror.
  - Economic decline in the US is compensated by its military dominance, allowing the country to assert its control using force.
  - Military force is preferred by the US administration, and it seeks others to fund its "mercenary" interventions.
  - The US military's pre-eminence enables the imposition of the principle that force rules the world.
- The World's "Rent-a-Thug":
  - In the 20th century, the US was a dominant economic power, using economic warfare as a weapon against opponents.
  - The US's economic decline relative to other powers, along with its military supremacy, has shifted its focus towards using force.
  - The US's primary strength is its military force, and it prefers this method over diplomacy or sanctions.
  - The US's role as a "willing mercenary" is recommended by policy analysts, where it employs its military power for a price.
  - The US's dominance in military power enables it to shape conflicts and achieve its goals through violence.
  - The US's reliance on military Keynesianism and financial manipulations leads to debts and social inequalities.
  - To divert attention from domestic problems, US leadership often inspires fear of external enemies and awe for its leaders.
  - The concept of threats has evolved, from the Soviet Union to various perceived enemies like Qaddafi, Grenada, Sandinistas, Noriega, and Saddam Hussein.
  - The ultimate perceived enemy is the Third World, which threatens global control and stability.
  - Changing these processes and institutions would require significant cultural, social, and institutional changes, including democratization beyond business-driven representation.

### Bainwashing at Home
- How the Cold War worked:
  - The primary concern of the Cold War was the "political threat" of Communism rather than military power.
  - The US dismissed possibilities for peaceful resolution of the Cold War conflict.
  - The historical record shows that few analysts disputed the idea that Russian political power, not military power, threatened the US.
  - NATO's role was seen as conveying confidence to exposed populations against Communist influence.
  - The US and USSR both preferred the other's disappearance but established a system of global management through the Cold War.
  - The Cold War was portrayed as a conflict between two superpowers caused by Soviet aggression.
  - Soviet interventions in Eastern Europe marked its Cold War actions, with invasions in East Berlin, Budapest, and Prague.
  - The US engaged in worldwide interventions, reflecting its role as the first global power.
  - The Cold War enabled the US to compel its population to support high-tech industry and aided the Soviet Union in solidifying its ruling class's power.
  - The Cold War created a framework where the US could control allies in Europe while the Soviet Union maintained its internal empire.
  - The end of the Cold War was characterized by Soviet military stagnation, internal problems, and eventual collapse.
  - The Cold War ended with the far richer and more powerful US as the victor.
- The war on (certain) drugs:
  - The US government launched a major campaign against drug trafficking, shifting public concerns from budget deficits to drugs.
  - The “war on drugs” became a substitute for the vanished “Evil Empire” as a threat.
  - Drug traffickers from Latin America were portrayed as a significant threat, leading to a media blitz and public concern.
  - The term “peace process” in the Middle East referred to US initiatives that rejected international efforts for peace.
  - The major media, owned by corporations, sold privileged audiences to other businesses.
  - The media, cultural managers, and political authorities often shared class interests and interacted in power structures.
  - Independent media could influence the dominant institutions, serving as a democratic threat to elites.
- War is Peace. Freedom is Slavery. Ignorance is Strength:
  - The manipulation of language and meaning is a recurring theme in political discourse.
  - Terms like "war is peace," "freedom is slavery," and "ignorance is strength" are examples of doublespeak used to confuse and control the public.
  - These slogans highlight the ability of those in power to manipulate language to serve their interests.
  - The goal is to create a situation where people accept contradictory statements as truth, undermining their ability to think critically.
  - This type of manipulation contributes to the maintenance of power structures by keeping the population submissive and confused.
- Socialism, Real and Fake:
  - The term "socialism" has been subject to diverse interpretations, but at its core, it involves worker control of production.
  - The Bolsheviks' rise to power in Russia, often labeled as "socialist," led to the dismantling of socialist institutions and the concentration of power in the hands of a centralized leadership.
  - Prominent Marxist thinkers criticized Lenin's and Trotsky's approach for centralizing authority, contrary to genuine socialist principles.
  - The Soviet Union's authoritarian regime contradicted the ideals of socialism, and the term was exploited by both Western propaganda and the Soviet regime.
  - With the collapse of the Soviet Union, the opportunity to rekindle libertarian socialist thought and challenge oppressive power structures arises.
- The Media:
  - Major media outlets, whether labeled as "liberal" or "conservative," are corporations selling audiences to advertisers.
  - Media corporations cater to privileged audiences and reflect the interests of both sellers and buyers.
  - Cultural managers, editors, and columnists share associations with state and business elites, leading to a convergence of interests.
  - Journalists often navigate between professional integrity and the need to serve the interests of power, providing opportunities for critical analysis.
  - While the media's product may reflect narrow interests, critical reading can still yield insights into power dynamics and social issues.
  - The media is a component of a larger doctrinal system that also includes academic institutions and journals of opinion.
  - The larger system's goal is to shape public opinion, diverting the majority and reinforcing societal values and passivity.
  - Alternative and independent media can influence public discourse and challenge dominant narratives.

### The Future

  - A comparison between the Kennedy and Reagan administrations highlights shifts in public response to similar policies, such as Kennedy's military actions against Cuba and Vietnam, and Reagan's intentions in Central America.
  - The emergence of spontaneous protests during the Reagan era signaled a change in public awareness and willingness to challenge state actions.
  - Despite claims of overcoming the "Vietnam syndrome," a leaked Bush administration document reveals the need for swift and decisive victories against weaker foes.
  - The year 1992 marked a shift in the response to historical events like the Columbus quincentenary, with increasing openness, skepticism, and questioning of authority.
  - The dynamic nature of these trends, though promising for independent thought and organizing, also raises the risk of rallying frightened masses behind new authoritarian leaders.
  - The importance of sustained and organized pressure against power structures is emphasized, highlighting the significance of ongoing efforts, lessons learned, and iterative improvement.
  - Public dissidence, even within authoritarian regimes, can exert influence and shape policies, particularly in societies with limited coercive force.
  - The role of citizens in elections is highlighted as a means to pressure representatives, though power tends to concentrate at higher levels within wealthier circles.

  - An imperative exists to protect the environment for a sustainable human existence, confronting illegitimate authority in various spheres.
  - The uncertainty of resolving complex issues is acknowledged, emphasizing the necessity of sincere effort in the face of potential disasters resulting from inaction.

## The Prosperous Few and the Restless Many
- The New Global Economy:
  - Objective power is concentrated in various places like patriarchy, race, and ownership, with a core in the principle that the country should be governed by those who own it.
  - This power structure remains even amidst other changes, and it often leads to systems of oppression and domination.
  - Suffering is an independent dimension that is worth overcoming, and there are different forms of oppression such as racism, sexism, and class oppression.
- NAFTA and GATT—who benefits?:
  - The global economic system concentrates power and ownership, leading to institutionalized forms of oppression and domination.
  - The influential and wealthy elite often construct justifications for their actions, whether sophisticated or not.
  - Sophisticated individuals can justify their actions using concepts like the "paradox of grace," allowing them to engage in harmful actions without guilt.
  - Intellectual gurus like Reinhold Niebuhr are revered by the establishment and can provide justifications for those in positions of power.
  - Fascism can arise even in democratic societies, as seen in historical trends, and religious fundamentalism can become a dangerous base for an extreme movement.
- Food and Third World “Economic Miracles”:
  - The vast majority of the population considers the economic system inherently unfair.
  - Achieving change requires collective action due to the investments and benefits associated with the current system.
  - Popular struggles have historically led to improvements, like the civil rights movement and workers' rights movements.
  - Despite popular support for ideas like a Canadian-style healthcare system, change is challenging due to corporate interests and the private enterprise system.
  - The power of the corporate sector may drive changes in the system if it aligns with their interests, as seen in auto companies' potential push for more efficient healthcare.
- Photo Ops in Somalia:
  - Discussion of photo ops in Somalia as a representation of power concentration and manipulation.
  - Reflection on the manipulation of media to control narratives and perception, giving an impression of humanitarian concern.
  - Mention of how photo ops are often utilized to serve political agendas, shaping public opinion to justify actions.
- Slav vs. Slav:
  - Explanation of the concept of power concentration and its presence in various forms such as patriarchy, race, and ownership.

- The Chosen Country:
  - Reflection on societal structures and governance, referencing John Jay's notion that a country should be governed by its owners.
  - Mention of Adam Smith's concept of self-interest and the role it plays in shaping society's behavior.
  - Explanation of how power dynamics and oppression are constructed to justify actions, both in individual and institutional contexts.
  - Exploration of human nature, the need to protect self-image, and how individuals rationalize their actions within power structures.
- Gandhi, Nonviolence, and India:
  - Gandhi's philosophy of nonviolence, or "ahimsa," played a pivotal role in India's struggle for independence against British colonial rule.
  - Nonviolent resistance was central to Gandhi's approach, advocating civil disobedience, boycotts, and passive resistance as means to challenge oppressive regimes.
  - The Salt March of 1930 exemplifies this strategy, where thousands marched to the Arabian Sea to produce salt in defiance of British salt taxes, demonstrating the power of nonviolent collective action.
- Divide and Conquer:
  - Colonial powers often employed the strategy of "divide and conquer" to maintain control over subjugated territories.
  - This approach involved exacerbating existing divisions within a population, whether ethnic, religious, or social, to weaken their unity and make resistance more challenging.
  - In the context of India, the British used religious differences, particularly between Hindus and Muslims, to create tensions and prevent the emergence of a united anti-colonial movement.
- The Roots of Racism:
  - Racism is deeply rooted in power structures, including patriarchy, race, and ownership, that concentrate objective power and perpetuate oppression.
  - The concept of ownership and the concentration of wealth are fundamental to societal dynamics, as articulated by the maxim "the country should be governed by those who own it."
  - Forms of oppression, such as racism and sexism, can be more severe than class oppression in people's lives, as seen in instances like racial violence overshadowing low wages in impact.
  - While suffering is an independent dimension, it is often rationalized by those in control through justifications that serve their interests, leading to phenomena like racism, which arises from protecting self-image.
  - Racism is not necessarily inherent in genes; rather, it is the need to protect self-image that's innate, driving individuals and systems to construct justifications for their actions.
- The Unmentionable Five-Letter Word:
  - The unmentionable five-letter word refers to "class" or the concept of social classes and economic inequality.
  - The idea is that class divisions, despite being a fundamental aspect of society, are rarely openly discussed and acknowledged.
  - The power of the wealthy and the ownership of resources play a crucial role in shaping society, alongside other forms of oppression like patriarchy and racism.
- Human Nature and Self-Image:
  - Human nature is complex and influenced by both genetics and environment, and some aspects are genetically determined.
  - Acquisition of language and growth of the visual system are examples of human nature.
  - Cultural patterns, belief systems, and behaviors are harder to define in terms of human nature and are often open to speculation.
  - The need to protect self-image is inherent in humans, leading to rationalizations even in oppressive situations.
  - The mechanisms of constructing justifications for actions, even harmful ones, are a part of human nature.
- It Can’t Happen Here...Can It?:
  - The notion that fascism, despite its extreme forms, can gain a foothold in any country, even a democratic one, is raised.
  - Fascism is suggested to be potentially wrapped in patriotic symbols and fueled by isolation and alienation.
  - Religious fundamentalism is seen as a potential base for a dangerous movement if combined with charismatic leaders.
  - The idea that the population's submission to rulers is predicated on controlling opinions rather than just physical force is discussed.
  - Despite public perception of inherent economic unfairness, collective action and organizing are challenging due to vested interests and cultural norms.
- Hume’s Paradox:
  - Hume's paradox highlights the apparent contradiction where the governed submit to rulers even though force is in the hands of the governed.
  - The rulers' ability to control opinion becomes crucial for maintaining power, regardless of the extent of their armed forces.
  - The concept of rulers needing to control opinion holds true across societies, from despotic to democratic.
- “Outside the Pale of Intellectual Responsibility”:
  - The characterization of being "outside the pale of intellectual responsibility" has been applied to the author by critics, positioning the author as an intellectual outlier.
  - This label could be attributed to the author's views and ideas that challenge mainstream narratives and conventional wisdom.
  - Critics like David Frum labeling the author a "great American crackpot" exemplify attempts to marginalize ideas that diverge from the established intellectual consensus.

## Secrets, Lies and Democracy

### The US
- Defective Democracy:
  - The US is witnessing a trend towards depoliticization and negativity, with about half the population advocating for the dissolution of both political parties.
  - A void exists for a platform that can address the concerns of the significant majority excluded from social planning and political processes.
  - Labor unions have historically played a pivotal role in democratization, yet without political affiliation, their impact is limited.
  - Notably, in healthcare, powerful US unions secured reasonable provisions for themselves but often neglected the broader population's health needs.
  - Contrasting with Canada, where labor-linked parties enabled universal healthcare implementation, illustrating the potency of politically-oriented popular movements.
  - The transformation of the labor force has changed dynamics, but the underlying questions about labor's influence remain relevant.
  - Authors Bernard and Mazzocchi propose a path that aligns with the power of labor movements.
- Keeping the Rich on Welfare:
  - A point of contention is the societal perception of welfare, especially corporate welfare, and the role of the rich.
  - Substantial public sentiments lean towards questioning the privileges and subsidies given to corporations and wealthy individuals.
  - The intricate link between labor unions and politics reveals the impact they can have when aligned with political systems.
  - Healthcare serves as a telling example, where powerful unions managed to secure favorable conditions for themselves, but broader public health initiatives were overlooked.
  - The US's skewed political system often fails to address the needs of the majority due to corporate influence and the lack of a labor-based party.
- Healthcare:
  - The healthcare scenario in the US underscores the divergence between labor unions' objectives and actual outcomes for the general public.
  - Powerful unions in the US secured reasonable healthcare provisions for their members, but lacked an incentive to advocate for universal healthcare.
  - Comparing with Canada, where labor-based parties supported healthcare for all, exposes the significance of aligning labor with politics.
  - The absence of a labor-based party in the US curtails the potential impact of labor unions on broad societal matters like healthcare.
  - The emergence of labor movements and their link to political parties in countries like Canada showcases the potential for positive change in social policy, including healthcare.
  - The dichotomy in healthcare outcomes between labor-oriented movements and independent unions underscores the role of politics in shaping societal well-being.
- Crime and Punishment:
  - The United States is witnessing a growing depoliticization and negativity, where around half of the population believes that both political parties should be dissolved.
  - There's a notable absence of articulation for the concerns of the majority of the population left out of social planning and politics.
  - Labor unions have historically played a significant role in democratization and progress, but their impact is limited when not linked to a labor-based political party.
  - Powerful labor unions in the US secured reasonable healthcare for themselves but didn't focus on healthcare for the general population, unlike unions linked to labor-based parties in countries like Canada.
  - Illustrating the potential of politically oriented movements, the example of labor movements in relation to healthcare highlights the difference they can make.
  - The shift away from industrial workers as the majority of the labor force doesn't diminish the relevance of labor-related questions.
  - The concept of May Day as a working-class holiday and its historical significance, though it's scarcely recognized in the US.
  - Anthony Lewis's criticism of labor unions' tactics in lobbying for their interests as perceived attacks on democracy, showcasing the bias towards the rich and powerful in the political system.
- Gun Control:
  - The United States has a deep-rooted culture of gun ownership, often framed in terms of individual rights and self-defense.
  - The idea of gun ownership as a means of protecting oneself from potential threats is widespread, bolstered by the "Second Amendment" argument.
  - There's a strong resistance to stricter gun control measures, with a belief that such measures could infringe on personal freedoms and rights.
  - The gun lobby, especially the National Rifle Association (NRA), plays a significant role in shaping the discourse around gun rights and regulations.
  - The debate on gun control often involves a struggle between those advocating for stricter regulations and those defending the perceived constitutional right to bear arms.
  - The gun control debate highlights the tension between the individual's right to self-defense and the broader societal concern for public safety and mass shootings.
- Becoming a Third World Country:
  - The concern is raised that the US is moving towards depoliticization and negativity, with significant portions of the population feeling marginalized from social planning and politics.
  - The need for an entity to address the concerns of the majority left out of the political process to prevent the US from deteriorating into a state akin to a Third World country.
  - The role of labor unions historically in driving democratization and progress, and the importance of political linkage to maximize their impact.
  - Comparison between the US and countries like Canada where labor-based parties have contributed to social initiatives, illustrating how politically-oriented popular movements can bring about change.
  - The decline of industrial workers as the majority labor force doesn't negate the significance of labor movements in addressing societal issues.
  - The impact of media and corporate lobbying on the perception of labor unions' actions, exemplified by the NAFTA debate.
  - The text mentions the role of the CIA in undemocratic activities, its control by the executive branch, and how it engages in efforts to undermine democracy, as seen in Chile.
  - Discussion on the influence of media on democracy and the role of public participation in shaping a democratic communications system.

- Labor:
  - The United States experiences a depoliticized atmosphere and a growing negative sentiment towards political parties.
  - A substantial portion of the population believes that both major political parties should be disbanded, indicating widespread discontent.
  - There's a perceived need for a movement that can articulate the concerns of a significant majority excluded from social planning and politics.
  - Labor unions historically played a role in democratization and progress, but their effectiveness is limited when not linked to a labor-based political party.
  - Labor unions in the US, acting independently of the political system, could secure favorable conditions for their members but often neglected broader societal needs.
  - Comparison with countries like Canada, where labor-based parties are more influential, illustrates the impact of political alignment on societal benefits.
  - Labor movements are crucial for achieving change and addressing the concerns of the majority, even as the nature of the labor force shifts from industrial workers.
- The CIA:
  - The Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) serves as an intelligence-gathering agency but is primarily engaged in secret and often covert activities.
  - The CIA's activities frequently involve efforts to undermine democracy, both within and outside the United States.
  - The question of whether the CIA acts as an instrument of state policy or formulates policy on its own remains debated, but executive control is evident.

  - There's a noticeable lack of representation for the concerns of the majority left out of social planning and the political process.
  - Labor unions, historically a force for democratization and progress, face limitations when not connected to a labor-based political party.
  - The example of healthcare shows the difference between US unions and labor-linked parties in Canada, where the latter successfully implemented universal healthcare.
  - Corporate lobbying often outweighs labor lobbying, but the former isn't criticized as much despite having more influence.
  - The media's role in shaping perceptions is evident in its coverage of labor's actions against NAFTA and its labeling of such actions as "crude, threatening tactics."
- Sports:
  - Spectator sports can make people more passive and non-participatory, as they watch others perform instead of engaging themselves.
  - Jingoistic and chauvinistic attitudes can arise from extreme passion for spectator sports, leading to antagonism even at the high school level.
  - The focus on spectator sports can divert attention from significant issues and events, like political decisions, by personalizing stories and figures.
  - The concept of the "information superhighway" is highlighted by examples: home shopping for women and interactive sports participation for men.
  - The glorification of athletes and the obsession with sports figures, akin to the John F. Kennedy cult, can redirect focus from matters that genuinely affect society.
- Religious Fundamentalism:
  - A significant portion of the American population believes in biblical prophecies, with estimates ranging from one-third to one-half.
  - The prevalence of religious fundamentalism in the US is distinct and comparable to societies before industrialization.

  - The rise of religious fundamentalism is not necessarily aligned with an actual adherence to individualistic values; it's a means of channeling dissent into more controllable forms.
- "Don't Tread on Me" Attitude:
  - The "Don't tread on me" attitude is a pervasive aspect of American culture, reflecting both independence and resistance to outside control.
  - This attitude is deeply rooted and exemplified by the pioneer spirit, individualism, and self-reliance.
  - However, this sentiment can have both positive and negative effects, depending on whether it fosters isolation or prevents collaboration with others.
  - The "Don't tread on me" ideology is often emphasized in propaganda and indoctrination, potentially preventing collective action that could challenge power structures.
  - While it signifies a healthy independence, it can also be manipulated to discourage participation in political decision-making.
  - This attitude coexists with a highly hierarchical and centralized structure within business organizations, which contradicts the ideal of individual autonomy.

### The World
- Toward Greater Inequality:
  - The election of Jean-Bertrand Aristide as Haiti's president was supported by grassroots organizations, Lavalas, and he initiated positive changes by reducing corruption, bureaucracy, and drug trafficking.
  - Despite initial progress, Aristide's popularity made him unacceptable to the US, which undermined him through "democracy-enhancing programs," ultimately leading to his overthrow.
  - US intervention aimed to replace Aristide's government with business-friendly "moderate" elements, eroding grassroots support and domestic democracy.
  - The US blocked Haitian refugees during the crisis, ignored human rights abuses under the coup, and maintained trade relations.
- "Free Trade":
  - "Free trade" policies supported by the US led to increasing inequality and dire consequences in various countries.
  - In Nicaragua, economic "reforms" resulted in widespread suffering, with deaths caused by collapsed health services, malnutrition, and disease.
  - Russia's Yeltsin administration implemented "reforms" to turn Eastern Europe into a source of resources and cheap labor, causing half a million deaths annually.
- Mexico (and South Central LA):
  - The "free trade" agenda had severe effects, leading to inequality and exploitation.
  - In Mexico, NAFTA and "free trade" policies marginalized small farmers and local industries, driving migration to the US.
  - South Central Los Angeles also suffered from inequality, with economic deterioration, lack of resources, and poverty leading to social unrest.
- Haiti:
  - Jean-Bertrand Aristide's surprising 1990 election win brought grassroots support, but the US aimed to undermine him.
  - US-backed coup in 1991, embargo, and support for alternate institutions aimed at destabilizing Aristide's administration.
  - Aristide's successful efforts to combat corruption, drug trafficking, and atrocities were met with US opposition.
  - Aristide's refusal to conform to US-demanded "moderate" governance led to his downfall.
  - Economic conditions worsened, and atrocities increased after Aristide's ousting, with the US trade still continuing.
  - The destruction of popular organizations and civil society aimed to quell potential resistance to US influence.
- Nicaragua:
  - Reagan and Kirkpatrick condemned Sandinistas for Miskito incidents, overshadowing greater atrocities by US-backed forces.
  - Miskitos faced mass starvation due to US-imposed policies in Nicaragua; drug epidemic among them due to deep-sea diving conditions.
  - Concerns over drug trade influence in the region following US victories in the Third World, leading to drug epidemics.
- China:
  - Clinton's announcement of sending high-tech equipment to China violated proliferation bans.
  - Worker fatalities in Chinese factories due to unsafe conditions, disregarded in human rights discourse.
  - Focus on prison labor as human rights violation while workplace safety concerns neglected.
- Russia:
  - The discussion centers around US support for Yeltsin versus democracy in Russia.
  - Yeltsin, the autocratic former Communist Party boss of Sverdlovsk, is favored by the West due to his willingness to implement so-called "reforms."
  - These reforms aim to push Russia back into its pre-Bolshevik Revolution status as a resource-rich, cheap labor hub for Western interests.
  - Yeltsin's alignment with Western business agendas labels him a "democrat" in the global context, highlighting the emphasis on pursuing economic interests over political principles.
  - The Western media tends to overlook Yeltsin's association with old party members who served during the Soviet era, as long as he promotes the desired business-driven reforms.
- Dead Children and Debt Service:
  - UNESCO reports reveal the staggering human costs of economic reforms aiming to return Eastern Europe to Third World status.
  - In Russia, approximately half a million deaths annually since 1989 can be attributed directly to these reforms, resulting from collapsing health services, disease outbreaks, and malnutrition.
  - Eastern Europe experiences similar trends with significant death tolls due to these reforms.
  - UNESCO's findings point out that about half a million African children perish each year due to the burden of debt service alone.
  - A startling eleven million children globally die annually from preventable diseases that could be addressed through inexpensive treatments.
  - These avoidable deaths underscore the impact of market-driven policies prioritizing economic principles over humanitarian concerns.
  - Historical parallels are drawn to British economists' mandates during the Irish potato famine, when Ireland was compelled to export food to Britain and denied food aid due to rigid adherence to political economy principles.
  - The consistent pattern in such policies is their propensity to favor the affluent while adversely affecting the impoverished.

## The Common Good

### The Common Good
- That Dangerous Radical Aristotle:
  - The conference in January 1997 sponsored by the Progressive Caucus in Washington DC was encouraging, with a lively atmosphere and a sense that many Americans support New Deal-style liberalism.
  - New Deal liberalism's achievements, rooted in popular struggle, are worth defending and expanding despite not being the end goal.
  - Aristotle's Politics laid the foundation for political theory, advocating participatory democracy, moderate property, and lasting prosperity for all as prerequisites for the common good.
  - Democracy requires relative equality and cannot coexist with extreme wealth disparities.
  - The idea that democracy and great wealth can't exist together has been present through history, including figures like de Tocqueville and Adam Smith.
  - Aristotle warned against extreme wealth and proposed reducing poverty or democracy to prevent injustice, whereas Madison aimed to reduce democracy.
  - Madison designed a system that marginalized citizens in favor of the wealthy, fearing democratic power would lead to land reform.
  - Madison's approach is a departure from humane liberal tradition.
  - In a true democracy, extreme wealth's consequences seen as inevitable in the market wouldn't be tolerated.
- Equality:
  - Aristotle and others held that equality of outcome should be a major goal for a just society, striving for relatively equal conditions.
  - Adam Smith and de Tocqueville admired relative equality in society, fearing that permanent inequality would harm democracy.
  - The push for equality of opportunity and outcome continues.
  - Affirmative action seeks to address inequality, with the goal of a more just society.
  - Affirmative action must be designed carefully to avoid harming the poor not covered by the designated support categories.
  - Libraries played a vital role in intellectual development, but their significance has diminished over time.
  - Inequality exists even in the realm of bookselling, impacting access to cultural resources.
  - Freedom, capitalism, and the idea of “free trade” are often manipulated to serve the interests of corporations.
  - The idea that shifting power to the states enhances freedom is deceptive, often favoring powerful corporations rather than “the people.”
  - The private tyrannies of corporations undermine actual freedom, with corporations enjoying rights similar to human beings.
  - There's a disconnect in people's views about government due to corporate propaganda.
  - Opposition to democracy and the rise of the far right pose concerns for corporate executives.
  - The fear of the ultra-right tendency stems from its populist streak and its potential impact on international institutions.
- Libraries:
  - Libraries played a significant role in the author's intellectual development during childhood.
  - The main public library in downtown Philadelphia was a crucial source of offbeat anarchist and left-Marxist literature.
  - Libraries were more extensively used in the past, contributing to a richer cultural environment in society.
  - Libraries, as public services, were more accessible and hopeful in the late 1930s and early 1940s.
  - Public services, including libraries, were more abundant and beneficial during that time, fostering hope in communities.

  - Modern libraries, especially in affluent areas, are now more limited in their collection of political books and literature.
  - Libraries have faced challenges due to market pressures, resulting in a reduced availability of a diverse range of books.
  - Changes in tax laws and market pressures have led to quicker remaindering of books and reduced book selection.
  - Libraries' decline in political book availability is not necessarily due to political censorship but market-driven factors.
- Freedom:
  - The term "freedom" has become synonymous with capitalism, often championed by advocates of the free market.
  - The idea of capitalism and freedom is misleading, as large corporations receive subsidies, protections, and benefits from governments.
  - The concept of "free trade" is often distorted, with corporations benefiting from state interventions and subsidies.
  - The manipulation of tax laws and regulations to favor powerful corporations highlights the incongruity between rhetoric and practice.
  - "Conservatives" promote shifting decisions to the state level as a way to empower the powerful to seek and exploit subsidies.

  - The federal government is often criticized while protecting corporate interests and serving as a source of subsidies.
  - Corporate propaganda has directed public anger at the government rather than at private power, reinforcing inequality.
  - The public's perception of government is influenced by decades of corporate propaganda, fueling anti-government sentiments.
  - Private corporations often undermine freedoms within their institutions, leading to parallels with totalitarian structures.

  - NATO's expansion also benefits military industries, creating a large market for weapons production, subsidized by taxpayers.
- The Myth of Third World Debt
  - The notion of Third World debt is based on a myth; it's a misleading concept that doesn't capture the real dynamics at play.
  - Debt is often portrayed as an unfortunate outcome of economic mismanagement, but it's more accurately a result of global power dynamics.
  - The Western powers, including the US, promoted policies that led to the debt crisis, such as pushing for excessive borrowing and deregulation.
  - These policies favored their own financial institutions and corporations, allowing them to accumulate wealth while exacerbating indebtedness.
  - Developing countries were often coerced into accepting loans and adopting policies that favored the interests of creditors.

  - Historically, the left has shown ambivalence towards political power, while the right vigorously pursues it.
  - The terms "left" and "right" lack clarity and utility, given the evolving ideologies and contradictions within them.
  - The term "left" encompasses Leninism, which contrasts with left-leaning values and is deemed ultra-right by some.

  - The use of terms like "left" and "right" in political discourse has been distorted and rendered irrelevant.
  - Witness for Peace's activism defies easy categorization as left or right, reflecting both justice and conservative Christian influence.
  - "Political correctness" may be labeled as left, but its nuanced implementation challenges clear classification.
  - The media's conscious or subconscious removal of terms' meanings, like "profits," shapes public perception and discourse.
  - The narrative shift on "populism" highlights how propaganda and media twist terminology and concepts.

  - This movement can be interpreted as more nuanced than often assumed, with opportunities for different outcomes.
  - Factors like the targeting of black men, war on drugs, and socio-economic challenges have influenced the movement's complexity.
  - While personal views on Farrakhan may vary, the broader phenomenon incorporates self-help, albeit within small-scale capitalism.
- Postmodernism:
  - Postmodernism involves critiques of science, culture, and society, analyzing how scientific work is influenced by cultural factors, power systems, and other elements.
  - While some postmodernist ideas may have value, much of the literature appears dense, jargon-laden, and challenging to read.
  - It's important to study the social and cultural assumptions underlying scientific work, but the best analyses often come from sources other than postmodernists.
- Excommunicated by the Illuminati:
