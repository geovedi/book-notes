# The Life of Ernst Chain
**Authors**: Ronald Clark | **Year**: 2011

## Summary
This biography tells the remarkable story of Ernst Boris Chain (1906-1979), the German-Jewish biochemist who played a crucial yet often overlooked role in the development of penicillin. Chain was one of three scientists awarded the Nobel Prize in 1945 for transforming Alexander Fleming's accidental discovery into a life-saving miracle drug that would save millions of lives. The book chronicles Chain's journey from his early life in Berlin through his escape from Nazi Germany to his pioneering work at Oxford, his establishment of a world-class research institute in Rome, and his final years at Imperial College London.

The narrative reveals not just the scientific breakthroughs but also the complex personality of a man described as a "temperamental Continental" - brilliant, outspoken, fiercely determined, and deeply committed to his Jewish faith. Chain's story is one of scientific genius intersecting with the major upheavals of the 20th century: the rise of Nazism, World War II, the birth of the pharmaceutical industry, and the establishment of Israel.

For anyone interested in the history of medicine, scientific discovery, or the personal stories behind breakthrough moments, this book offers invaluable insights into how penicillin moved from laboratory curiosity to global health revolution, and the passionate, sometimes difficult scientist who helped make it happen.

## Core Insights

### The Berlin Beginnings: Formation of a Scientific Mind
Ernst Chain grew up in Berlin's vibrant cultural and intellectual atmosphere of the 1920s, where science and art flourished side by side. Born to Russian-German parents, his family emphasized intellectual pursuits above all else - Chain later wrote that his parents indoctrinated him with "the maxim that was beyond discussion, that the only worthwhile occupation in life was the pursuit of intellectual activities." This foundation, combined with his natural linguistic abilities and musical talent, created the intellectual curiosity and determination that would serve him throughout his career.

Chain initially considered becoming a professional pianist but ultimately chose science, believing he could become a good pianist but never a great one. His early work on enzymes at Berlin's Charité Hospital established his reputation in biochemistry and set the stage for his future breakthroughs. The rise of the Nazis in 1933 forced his abrupt departure from Germany with only £10 in his pocket - a decision he later explained was driven by disgust with the Nazi gang rather than fear for his life, tragically leaving behind his mother and sister who would later die in Theresienstadt concentration camp.

> "I left Germany because I felt disgusted with the Nazi gang, not because I thought my life was in danger. I did not believe that the system would last more than six months at the most."
> _Original: "I left Germany because I felt disgusted with the Nazi gang, not because I thought my life was in danger. I did not believe that the system would last more than six months at the most."_

**Quick Take**: Chain's early experiences in Germany shaped his character - the intellectual rigor, cultural appreciation, and resilient determination that would prove essential in his later scientific struggles.

### The Oxford Breakthrough: Penicillin's Realization
Chain's move to England in 1933 led to his crucial collaboration with Howard Florey at Oxford's William Dunn School of Pathology. While Fleming had discovered penicillin's antibacterial properties in 1928, it was Chain and Florey who, a decade later, recognized its therapeutic potential and developed methods to extract and stabilize it. Chain's chemical expertise was instrumental in solving the major challenge of extracting penicillin from mold cultures in sufficient quantities for testing.

The book reveals the intense pressure and competition during wartime research, as well as the interpersonal tensions that developed between Chain, Florey, and Fleming. Chain's determination to secure British leadership in antibiotics production drove him to advocate for government investment in penicillin manufacturing facilities. His frustration with official bureaucracy and what he saw as Britain's failure to capitalize on its scientific advantage would eventually lead him to leave Oxford for Rome in 1948.

> "In pure science if what you do is a success you write a paper; if it is a failure you write a paper. With applied science it is harder. If what you are doing works it is a success; if it does not it is nothing more than a failure."
> _Original: "In pure science if what you do is a success you write a paper; if it is a failure you write a paper. With applied science it is harder. If what you are doing works it is a success; if it does not it is nothing more than a failure."_

**Quick Take**: The penicillin breakthrough demonstrates how scientific discovery requires both theoretical understanding and practical application - Chain's strength was bridging this crucial gap.

### The Roman Renaissance: Building a Research Empire
In 1948, frustrated by British resistance to investing in antibiotic research infrastructure, Chain accepted an offer to establish a new biochemical research institute in Rome. There, with generous funding and freedom from bureaucratic constraints, he created what became the first international center for antibiotic research. The Italian years marked Chain's transformation from pure scientist to scientific entrepreneur, as he developed groundbreaking techniques for deep fermentation that revolutionized antibiotic production.

Chain's Roman institute became a model for integrating academic research with industrial application, attracting scientists from around the world and establishing pioneering methods for producing modified penicillins. His success demonstrated the importance of adequate funding and equipment for advancing biochemical research - a lesson that would later influence his advocacy for better research facilities in Britain. The Roman period also saw Chain increasingly embrace his Jewish identity and strengthen his connections with Israel and Jewish scientific institutions.

**Quick Take**: Chain's Roman success proved that with proper resources and freedom, scientific innovation can flourish, transforming both research capabilities and practical applications.

### The Imperial Return: Science Policy and Legacy
Chain's return to Britain in 1964 as head of Imperial College's new Biochemistry Department marked his final chapter as a scientific leader. Using his international reputation and connections, he secured substantial funding to build state-of-the-art facilities, including fermentation plants costing hundreds of thousands of pounds. At Imperial College, Chain became increasingly outspoken about government interference in scientific research and the importance of maintaining academic freedom.

His later years saw him emerge as a passionate advocate for breaking down barriers between "pure" and "applied" science, arguing that modern research required both theoretical understanding and practical application. Chain also became a strong supporter of Jewish education and Israel, serving on the Weizmann Institute's board of governors and increasingly connecting his scientific work with his religious faith. His final retirement years were marked by continued research, international consulting, and ongoing battles over academic freedom and scientific independence.

> "Food science is a marvellous example of how closely and indissolubly the so-called pure and applied sciences are tied together, how one cannot exist without the other, and how nonsensical attempts are to separate them into 'higher' and 'lower' categories."
> _Original: "Food science is a marvellous example of how closely and indissolubly the so-called pure and applied sciences are tied together, how one cannot exist without the other, and how nonsensical attempts are to separate them into 'higher' and 'lower' categories."_

**Quick Take**: Chain's later career demonstrates that scientific leadership extends beyond laboratory work to shaping research policy and defending academic freedom.

- "It must be remembered that, quite apart from the ephemeral nature of scientific theories, pure science is ethically neutral. No value of good or bad is attached to any natural constant, or, for that matter, any scientific observation in any field. However, in our relations to our fellow-men - and this includes, in particular, the applications of scientific research - we must be guided by an ethical code of behaviour, and pure science cannot provide it."
