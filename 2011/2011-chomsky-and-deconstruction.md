# Chomsky and Deconstruction: The Politics of Unconscious Knowledge
**Authors**: Christopher Wise | **Year**: 2011

## Summary
"Chomsky and Deconstruction" offers a critical examination of Noam Chomsky's linguistic theory from the perspective of Jacques Derrida's deconstructive philosophy. The book explores how Chomsky's concept of universal grammar relies on a "mystical" notion of unconscious knowledge that, while presented as scientific, contains unexamined metaphysical and political assumptions.

This work is essential for readers interested in:
- Understanding the philosophical foundations of Chomsky's linguistics
- Exploring how deconstruction critiques scientific objectivity
- Examining the political implications of linguistic theories
- Bridging analytic and continental philosophical traditions

## Core Insights

### The Unconscious Knowledge Problem
Chomsky's theory of universal grammar posits that humans possess innate, unconscious knowledge of language structures. Wise argues this "unconscious knowledge" functions as what Derrida would call a "transcendental signified" - an ultimate, unquestionable foundation that Chomsky treats as scientific despite its mystical nature.

> "The construction of a grammar of language by a linguist is in some respects analogous to the acquisition of language by the child."
> _Original: The construction of a grammar of language by a linguist is in some respects analogous to the acquisition of language by the child._

**Quick Take**: Chomsky's supposed scientific objectivity masks a romantic, metaphysical foundation that operates like religious faith.

### Biolinguistics as Rhetorical Strategy
Wise reveals how Chomsky rebranded his "rational linguistics" as "biolinguistics" for strategic reasons, framing language as a biological organ to lend scientific credibility to what remains fundamentally a philosophical theory.

> "I am assuming here the basic framework of Chomsky (1955–6), though of course there have been radical changes since."

**Quick Take**: Scientific terminology often conceals philosophical assumptions; the "biological" framing serves rhetorical rather than empirical purposes.

### The Cartesian Revival
Chomsky emerges as a neo-Cartesian thinker, maintaining the sharp distinction between human and animal that Descartes established. His theory of language as what truly separates humans from animals perpetuates a metaphysical hierarchy with ethical implications.

> "To say that 'language is not innate' is to say that there is no difference between my granddaughter, a rock, and a rabbit."

**Quick Take**: Chomsky's human-animal distinction isn't scientific observation but metaphysical assertion with political consequences.

### Deconstruction vs. Scientific Objectivity
The book contrasts Chomsky's quest for a "Martian perspective" - supposedly unbiased scientific objectivity - with Derrida's insistence on acknowledging historical and personal investment in knowledge production. For Derrida, all claims to pure objectivity already contain their own blind spots.

> "The starting point of critical elaboration is the consciousness of what one really is, and 'knowing thyself' as a product of the historical process to date."
> _Original: The starting point of critical elaboration is the consciousness of what one really is, and 'knowing thyself' as a product of the historical process to date._

**Quick Take**: True intellectual rigor requires acknowledging our historical situatedness rather than pretending to transcend it.

## Best Quotes

- "All of this is done without reasons, just as we follow rules ourselves without having reasons ('blindly')."
  _Original: All of this is done without reasons, just as we follow rules ourselves without having reasons ("blindly")._

- "By rights, the content of historical and positive knowledge is not required, as shocking as that may appear. It remains external to the philosophical act as such."

- "There are people who have achieved close to normal linguistic competence with no sensory input beyond what can be gained by placing one's hand on another person's face and throat."

- "When pressed to clarify if he believes that he is finally a scientist or a philosopher, Chomsky states that he 'take[s] no stand' on the question, which he rejects as 'too vague'."

## Key Takeaways

- Question claims to scientific objectivity in human sciences - they often conceal philosophical assumptions
- Recognize how linguistic theories have political and ethical consequences beyond their technical claims
- Deconstruction offers tools to examine the foundations of apparently "objective" disciplines
- The human-animal distinction in philosophy has ethical implications we must confront
- All knowledge production is historically situated; acknowledging this strengthens rather than weakens analysis

## Questions to Consider

1. How do supposedly "scientific" theories of language carry political and ethical assumptions?
2. What are the consequences of drawing sharp lines between human and animal capabilities?
3. Can we truly achieve objective knowledge about human phenomena like language?
4. How does Chomsky's military funding affect his claims to scientific objectivity?
5. What responsibility do linguists have for the political implications of their theories?

## Conclusion
"Chomsky and Deconstruction" is worth your time if you're interested in the philosophical foundations of linguistics or the tension between scientific objectivity and human situatedness. Wise demonstrates that Chomsky's theory, while presented as value-neutral science, contains profound metaphysical and political commitments that deserve scrutiny.

The book's biggest strength is showing how deconstruction isn't merely abstract theory but provides concrete tools for examining the foundations of influential scientific paradigms. Whether you accept Wise's critique or not, you'll never look at linguistic theory the same way again.
