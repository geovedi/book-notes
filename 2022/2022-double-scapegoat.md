# Double Scapegoat
**Original Title**: Dubbel zondebok
**Author**: Piet Hagen | **Year**: 2022 

## Summary
Double Scapegoat is a comprehensive historical work that chronicles the persecution of Jewish journalists, photographers, and other media professionals in the Netherlands from 1920-1945. The book reveals how Jewish journalists were among the first victims of Nazi persecution, targeted immediately from the first day of the German occupation. The title refers to the dual role Jewish journalists played as scapegoats—first targeted by the Nazis as the supposed "lying press," then becoming scapegoats for broader societal problems through antisemitic propaganda.

The book traces how more than 400 Jewish journalists and media workers systematically lost their positions, were deported, and often murdered. It documents the gradual "coordination" (Gleichschaltung) of the Dutch press, replacing independent journalism with Nazi propaganda. The work serves as both a memorial to these victims and a warning about how antisemitism, conspiracy theories, and fake news can resurface in democratic societies.

This book is essential reading for historians, journalists, and anyone interested in understanding how media manipulation and prejudice can undermine democratic institutions. Readers will gain profound insights into the mechanisms of propaganda, the vulnerability of press freedom, and the human cost of ideological hatred.

## Core Insights

### The First Victims: Jewish Journalists as Immediate Targets
From the very first day of the Nazi occupation in May 1940, Jewish journalists were fired and persecuted. The book documents how 23 Jewish employees of the Algemeen Nederlands Persbureau and four more at related organizations were dismissed on day one of the occupation. This immediate targeting revealed the Nazis' true intentions and served as a precursor to the broader Holocaust. The persecution wasn't incidental but a core component of Nazi ideology, supported by a small but fanatical segment of the Dutch press.

> "The term 'scapegoat' indicates that innocent people are designated as a danger to society because of their origin or faith. They are blamed for epidemics like the plague, economic crises, or military defeats and are—in the words of the Biblical book of Leviticus—sent into the desert."
> _Original: "De term 'zondebok' geeft aan dat onschuldige mensen vanwege hun afkomst of geloof worden aangewezen als een gevaar voor de samenleving. Zij krijgen de schuld van epidemieën als de pest, economische crises of militaire nederlagen en worden—in de woorden van het Bijbelboek Leviticus—de woestijn in gezonden."_

**Quick Take**: Media freedom is often the first casualty of totalitarian regimes, and journalists are frequently targeted because they can expose the truth.

### Hitler's Obsession with the "Jewish Lying Press"
The book meticulously traces how Hitler's antisemitism was particularly focused on Jewish journalists, whom he blamed for spreading "lies" about Germany. Hitler's worldview, developed in Vienna and crystallized in "Mein Kampf," portrayed Jews as controlling the international press and using it to spread Marxism and undermine German culture. This obsession wasn't just rhetorical—it led to systematic extermination of Jewish media professionals.

> "The press is in the hands of the Jews and they preach Marxism everywhere. Jews are cosmopolitans who have no bond with the country where they live, and in any case, they are not German. Hitler is surprised that their 'arts of lying' are nevertheless accepted as true by a large public."
> _Original: "De pers is in handen van de Joden en die prediken overal het marxisme. Joden zijn kosmopolieten die geen binding hebben met het land waar ze wonen, en in ieder geval zijn ze geen Duitser. Hitler verbaast zich erover dat hun 'leugenkunsten' toch door een groot publiek voor waar worden aangenomen."_

**Quick Take**: Conspiracy theories about media control are not new and have historically been used to justify persecution and violence.

### The Gradual Coordination of Dutch Media
The Nazis systematically took control of Dutch media through a process called "Gleichschaltung" (coordination). This wasn't sudden but happened gradually—first removing Jewish journalists, then replacing non-cooperative editors with Nazi sympathizers, and finally transforming all media into propaganda instruments. By 1944, the number of Dutch newspapers had been drastically reduced, with only approved voices remaining.

> "After the capitulation on May 14, a number of Jewish editorial offices independently decided to temporarily suspend publication, out of fear that the Germans would otherwise intervene."
> _Original: "Direct na de capitulatie op 14 mei besluit een aantal Joodse redacties uit zichzelf de uitgave voorlopig te staken, uit angst dat de Duitsers anders zullen ingrijpen."_

**Quick Take**: The erosion of press freedom often happens through incremental steps rather than sudden changes.

### Jewish Resistance Through Underground Media
Despite persecution, many Jewish journalists participated actively in the Dutch resistance through underground newspapers. The book documents how more than 100 Jewish workers were involved in producing and distributing illegal publications. These clandestine newspapers provided crucial information that the Nazi-controlled press suppressed, including early reports about the Holocaust.

> "Jewish journalists have an important share in the underground press. In the overview of the illegal press by the Foundation for the Dutch Resistance Monument, 605 names are mentioned of people involved in the resistance, of whom 138 are in some way connected to the illegal press."
> _Original: "Joodse journalisten hebben een belangrijk aandeel in de ondergrondse pers. Van de 605 namen die de Stichting Nederlandsch Verzetsmonument vermeldt in het project 'Joodse mensen in het verzet' zijn 138 op de een of andere manier betrokken bij de illegale pers."_

**Quick Take**: Even under the most repressive conditions, independent journalists find ways to pursue truth and inform the public.

### The Media War and Truth Finding
The book emphasizes that wars are fought not only on battlefields but also in media. The Nazis waged a two-front war: against countries with different ideologies and against Jews. They used the latest media technology—newspapers with mass circulation, radio broadcasts reaching every home, and propaganda films—to spread hatred. This media warfare was the beginning of the Holocaust as the genocide of Jews and the attempt to eliminate the spirit of Judaism.

> "Wars are not only fought on the battlefield, but also in the media. This certainly applies to the war that the Nazis fought on two fronts: against countries with other ideologies (liberalism, capitalism, communism) and against the Jews. They made use of the newest media for this."
> _Original: "Oorlogen worden niet alleen op het slagveld gevoerd, maar ook in de media. Dat geldt zeker voor de oorlog die de nazi's op twee fronten voerden: tegen landen met andere ideologieën (liberalisme, kapitalisme, communisme) en tegen de Joden. Daarbij maakten ze gebruik van de nieuwste media."_

**Quick Take**: Control of information is as crucial to totalitarian regimes as military power.

## Conclusion

Double Scapegoat is more than a historical account; it's a crucial warning about how media manipulation, prejudice, and propaganda can undermine democratic institutions. The book demonstrates that the persecution of journalists wasn't a peripheral aspect of Nazi rule but central to their strategy for controlling society.

The biggest reason to read this book is its chilling relevance to contemporary challenges. In an era of fake news, conspiracy theories, and attacks on "mainstream media," Hagen's historical analysis provides essential context for understanding how democratic societies can slide into authoritarianism. The systematic targeting of Jewish journalists shows how attacks on press freedom often serve as an early warning system for broader attacks on human rights and democratic values.

This work serves as both a memorial to the more than 400 Jewish media professionals who perished and a vital lesson about the importance of defending independent journalism. It reminds us that the cost of failing to protect press freedom is measured not just in lost careers but in human lives. In today's digital age, where misinformation spreads faster than ever, the lessons of Double Scapegoat are more urgent than ever.
