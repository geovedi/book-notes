# The Scan
**Original Title**: De scan
**Authors**: Marko van der Beek | **Year**: 2022

## Summary
"The Scan" reveals a revolutionary approach to understanding the connection between body and mind through advanced scanning technology called ScanCoaching. This method measures energy patterns in the body to uncover the root causes of physical, emotional, and psychological issues. The author, a former businessman who experienced a severe burn-out, discovered that 80% of illnesses are stress-related and begin with unconscious decisions made early in life—sometimes even before birth.

The book introduces a cutting-edge scanning device (originally from Russian medical technology) that can read the body's energetic fields and translate them into psychological insights. It shows how trauma, programming, and unresolved emotions get stored in our cellular memory and manifest as physical symptoms years later. The ScanCoaching method provides a way to identify these patterns, understand their origins, and consciously release them to restore health and well-being.

This book is perfect for anyone interested in holistic health, personal development, or alternative healing methods. Readers will gain a new understanding of how their body communicates psychological truths and learn about a revolutionary tool for self-discovery and healing.

## Core Insights

### The Body-Mind Connection is Measurable
Modern science has long acknowledged the connection between body and mind, but ScanCoaching actually measures this connection through energetic frequencies. Every organ, emotion, and thought pattern has a specific frequency that can be detected and analyzed. The scanning technology reads these frequencies and translates them into psychological insights, revealing the hidden connections between your physical symptoms and emotional patterns.

> "Body and mind are one, but do we really live accordingly? Do we let our bodies tell us how we're doing?"
> _Original: "Lichaam en geest zijn een, het zal je niet vreemd in de oren klinken. Maar leven we daar wel naar?"_

**Quick Take**: Your body constantly communicates your psychological state through measurable energy patterns that modern technology can now read and interpret.

### The Imprint and Child Decision Shape Your Life
Two critical moments in early development create the foundation for your life patterns: the "imprint" (experiences in the womb) and "child decisions" (unconscious decisions made before age 4). During pregnancy, whatever your mother experiences emotionally gets encoded in your cellular memory. In early childhood, you make unconscious decisions about how to survive and protect yourself, which continue to influence your behavior throughout life.

> "A trauma that your mother experiences during pregnancy is immediately recorded in both her own and your genetic structure."
> _Original: "Een trauma dat je moeder tijdens de zwangerschap oploopt, wordt onmiddellijk in zowel haar eigen als in jouw genstructuur opgenomen."_

**Quick Take**: Many of your current life patterns and limitations stem from experiences before birth and early childhood decisions that you can now identify and change.

### Your Body Never Lies
While your mind can rationalize, deny, or confuse, your body holds the objective truth about your experiences and emotions. The scanning technology bypasses conscious awareness and reads directly from your body's cellular memory. This means you can't hide from your truth—the scan reveals exactly what's happening on all levels: physical, emotional, mental, and spiritual.

> "Your body lies never. And your body is the only one who really knows what you're here to do."
> _Original: "En je lichaam liegt nooit. En je lichaam is de enige die echt weet wat je hier te doen hebt."_

**Quick Take**: Your cellular memory holds the complete truth of your experiences, and this technology can access it directly for profound self-awareness.

### Awareness Changes Your Biochemistry
When you become conscious of unconscious patterns and programming, you literally change your body's chemistry. Understanding the root cause of symptoms allows you to release the energy holding them in place. The book shows how consciousness itself is healing—once you understand why you've created certain patterns, you can consciously choose new ones and your body will follow.

> "Good news: this is your mother's trauma. Bad news: you have to resolve it. But because it's her trauma, you don't have to process it through therapy."
> _Original: "Het goede nieuws is dat dit het trauma van je moeder is, maar het slechte nieuws is dat jij het moet oplossen."_

**Quick Take**: Self-awareness is biologically transformative—understanding your patterns changes your body's energy flow and chemistry.

### The Five Elements Reveal Emotional Patterns
The book incorporates Traditional Chinese Medicine's five-element system (Wood, Fire, Earth, Metal, Water) to understand how emotions relate to organs. Each element represents specific emotions and behavioral patterns when in balance or excess. For example, the Wood element (liver/gallbladder) relates to anger and frustration, while the Water element (kidneys/bladder) connects to fear and survival instincts.

> "Every organ stands for a certain emotion, which makes it more understandable and plausible. This is language everyone understands."
> _Original: "Met het idee dat ieder orgaan voor een bepaalde emotie staat, wordt dat begrijpelijker en ook aannemelijker."_

**Quick Take**: Your emotional patterns are stored in specific organs, and understanding these connections helps you address root causes of physical and emotional issues.
