## Men with No Names

The story revolves around the investigation and trial of Ross Ulbricht, the mastermind behind the infamous online black market known as the Silk Road. The narrative highlights the crucial role played by several individuals, each with their own code names and hidden identities, as they navigate the dark corners of the internet and the complexities of cryptocurrency.

One key figure in the investigation is Tigran Gambaryan, an IRS agent who becomes determined to trace the flow of bitcoins associated with the Silk Road. With a deep understanding of blockchain technology, Gambaryan follows the digital footprints left by Carl Mark Force, a corrupt DEA agent who infiltrated the Silk Road under the pseudonym "Nob." As Gambaryan delves deeper, he uncovers evidence that Force has been embezzling funds and manipulating the investigation.

Meanwhile, other characters come into play, such as Shaun Bridges, a Secret Service agent who also had ties to the Silk Road investigation. Bridges, who goes by the code name "FrenchMaid," exhibits hostility towards Gambaryan and his team, further complicating the pursuit of justice.

As the trial unfolds, Ulbricht's defense team presents a narrative suggesting that he was merely a pawn, tricked into taking the fall for the true operators of the Silk Road. However, the prosecution, with the help of experts like Nick Weaver, a computer scientist, and Ilhwan Yum, a former FBI agent, uses the blockchain to trace the flow of bitcoins from the Silk Road's server directly to Ulbricht's personal wallet. The evidence presented on the blockchain refutes the defense's claims and solidifies Ulbricht's connection to the illegal activities conducted on the Silk Road.

In the end, the story highlights the power of technology and the tireless efforts of individuals like Gambaryan, Weaver, and Yum, who utilize their expertise to expose the truth behind the men with no names, ultimately leading to Ulbricht's conviction and the dismantling of the Silk Road.

## AlphaBay

AlphaBay was a notorious dark web marketplace that operated from 2014 to 2017, facilitating the sale of illegal goods and services. It gained prominence as one of the largest and most active online marketplaces, offering a wide range of illicit products, including drugs, weapons, stolen data, and counterfeit documents. AlphaBay's founder and administrator, Alexandre Cazes, was arrested in Thailand in July 2017 as part of a multinational law enforcement operation known as Operation Bayonet.

The operation involved the takedown of both AlphaBay and its competitor, Hansa Market, which had been secretly taken over by Dutch authorities. This one-two punch was aimed at disrupting the dark web's continuous cycle of market raids and renewal. While the operation successfully shut down AlphaBay and led to the arrest of Cazes, it also raised questions about the long-term effectiveness of such crackdowns.

The takedown of AlphaBay had a significant impact on the dark web ecosystem. Vendors and buyers migrated to other marketplaces, with Dream Market emerging as a major successor. However, studies indicated that the disruption caused by Operation Bayonet had a more lasting effect compared to previous dark web busts. Some vendors didn't reappear, and those who did had to rebuild their identities from scratch, suggesting a game-changing intervention by law enforcement.

Despite the operation's success, experts remain skeptical about the long-term impact on the dark web economy. The resilience of this underground ecosystem, coupled with the constant demand for illegal products, suggests that new markets will continue to emerge as law enforcement cracks down on existing ones. The case of AlphaBay serves as a reminder of the ongoing cat-and-mouse game between law enforcement and dark web operators, with the illicit trade persisting in the face of enforcement efforts.

## Welcome to Video

"Welcome to Video" was an extensive investigation into one of the largest child sexual abuse materials websites in history. The case involved a global network of perpetrators and users, leading to numerous arrests and the takedown of the site. The investigation began when two IRS-CI agents received a tip about the site while waiting at an airport. They teamed up with other law enforcement agencies, including Homeland Security Investigations (HSI) and Chainalysis, to track the flow of Bitcoin payments on the blockchain and identify the site's administrator, Son Jong-woo.

The investigation spanned several continents, uncovering the horrifying extent of child exploitation facilitated by the site. It revealed the involvement of individuals from various backgrounds, including doctors, principals, and even law enforcement officers. As the agents meticulously followed the money trail, they were able to identify and apprehend numerous offenders, rescuing victims in the process.

The Welcome to Video server, containing over 250,000 videos of child sexual abuse, was eventually located in South Korea. The case brought international attention to the issue of online child exploitation and prompted significant public outrage. While Son Jong-woo received a relatively light sentence in Korea, the case sparked legislative efforts to strengthen punishments for such crimes and raised awareness about the need for stricter regulations.

The investigation didn't stop with the takedown of Welcome to Video. The team continued to follow leads and identified other individuals involved in similar illicit activities. The ripple effects of the case led to arrests in different countries, exposing additional dark web platforms and expanding the fight against online child exploitation.

Ultimately, the Welcome to Video investigation highlighted the vital role of financial tracking and blockchain analysis in combating criminal activities. The collaboration between law enforcement agencies and technology experts demonstrated the potential of leveraging digital evidence to bring perpetrators to justice. However, the case also underscored the ongoing challenges in addressing such heinous crimes and the need for continued efforts to protect vulnerable children and prosecute those responsible.

## The Next Round
