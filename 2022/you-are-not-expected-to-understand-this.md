## The First Line of Code
Author: Elena Botella

Code is a fundamental concept in computing, consisting of a set of instructions given to a machine to produce consistent output. Its origins can be traced back to as early as 1725 when Basile Bouchon utilized punch cards to control a loom. While Bouchon's loom had limited adoption, Joseph Marie Jacquard built upon the idea, leading to the development of the Jacquard Loom, which gained wider usage.

The significance of the Jacquard Loom extended beyond textiles, as it caught the attention of pioneers like Ada Lovelace and Charles Babbage. They referenced the loom when explaining the principles behind how future computers would operate.

Later on, Alan Turing played a pivotal role in defining what makes a computer a computer: the ability to perform any computation. His concept of "Turing complete" refers to computers and programming languages that meet his standards for universal computation.

In modern computing, everything a computer or smartphone accomplishes involves computation, even tasks as diverse as displaying graphics. Herman Hollerith's use of punch cards to compute data more efficiently paved the way for the establishment of IBM.

Early examples of "coding" can be found in historical inventions like the Banu Musa brothers' automatic flute player and player pianos, which utilized coded instructions to produce music.

Punch cards, represented by holes in paper, became a critical aspect of early computing and continue to underlie modern computing systems, demonstrating the enduring impact of these early developments on today's technological landscape.

## The Police Beat Algorithm: The Code That Launched Computational Policing and Modern Racial Profiling
Author: Charlton McIlwain

The Police Beat Algorithm (PBA) emerged as a software system in the early 1960s, with the primary objective of aiding police departments in collecting crime data and deploying resources effectively. This development was prompted by the rising crime problem and urban uprisings during the civil rights era in the United States. IBM's expertise in problem-solving and the success of computing technology in other fields played a significant role in the creation of the PBA as a potential solution to crime-related challenges.

Mathematician Saul I. Gass was the mind behind the PBA's design, envisioning a system that would divide municipal areas and strategically deploy police resources based on crime data. However, the algorithm's implementation predominantly relied on pattern recognition, profiling, dragnetting, and patrol positioning. Unfortunately, these methods often resulted in the targeting and surveillance of Black and brown communities.

The biased and self-fulfilling outcomes of the PBA perpetuated racial profiling and had a detrimental impact on communities of color. As the algorithm was put into action in places like Kansas City, it led to the concentration of police presence in predominantly Black neighborhoods, deepening the disparities and injustices faced by these communities.

Moreover, the concept of the PBA found its way into various other law enforcement technologies, contributing to the perpetuation of racial biases and disparities in contemporary policing practices. The consequences of such biased algorithms have raised concerns about the fairness and ethical implications of technology's role in law enforcement and the need for greater scrutiny and accountability in its application.

## JPEG: The Unsung Hero in the Digital Revolution
Author: Hany Farid

The JPEG image format serves as a standard compression scheme for digital cameras, providing a flexible balance between image size and quality. This compression technique finds its roots in the groundbreaking work of French mathematician Jean-Baptiste Joseph Fourier, who laid the foundations for efficient digital representation, storage, and transmission of audio, images, and video through his insights into sinusoids.

JPEG compression makes use of the Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) to efficiently compress images by discarding less visually noticeable information. It prioritizes preserving more information about luminance contrast and low frequencies since humans are more sensitive to these aspects. The DCT transforms image blocks into frequency-based representations, allowing for tailored compression to different frequencies.

One of the key advantages of JPEG compression is the fine control it offers over compression parameters, allowing users to adjust settings from high-compression/low-quality to low-compression/high-quality, based on their specific needs and preferences.

Interestingly, JPEG compression has inadvertently played a crucial role in the forensic analysis of digital images. Its settings, along with unique imperfections introduced by different cameras, enable the identification of the camera make and model used to capture an image. This feature has proven valuable in criminal investigations, including cases involving child predators, where forensic analysis using JPEG compression settings has helped secure convictions.

Author: Lily Hay Newman

The most downloaded image in history is not a famous picture but a seemingly innocuous transparent tracking pixel. Also known as 1 × 1 pixels, web bugs, or invisible GIFs, tracking pixels were originally used as visual spacers in early web page layouts. However, marketers and advertising networks recognized their potential for data collection and started using them in the mid-1990s to track users' online activities for targeted advertising.

When a user opens a web page or an email, the browser or mail client sends a request for images, including the tracking pixel. Unbeknownst to most users, these pixels gather identifying data about their browsing habits and web activity, raising concerns among privacy advocates.

The challenge with tracking pixels lies in their embedded nature on websites, making them difficult for users to disable or opt-out. This lack of transparency has fueled privacy concerns and calls for better safeguards.

Over time, tracking pixels have evolved, and tech companies are now offering tools to give users more control over their data and privacy. Apple's initiatives, such as AppTrackingTransparency and features in operating systems like iOS 15 and macOS Monterey, aim to block tracking pixels and protect user data.

While these efforts are seen as important steps in the right direction, some believe that more comprehensive transformations may be necessary to fully protect user privacy. The targeted ad industry, deeply rooted in data collection, may not be dismantled quickly. Nonetheless, small gestures and technological changes are seen as potential catalysts for a privacy revolution in the future.

Bitcoin's core mission was to transform the way people trust and transact with each other. By leveraging blockchain technology, it achieved consensus through cryptography and economic incentives, allowing trust to flourish even in low-trust environments. As Nakamoto's work progressed, he disappeared from the public eye in 2011, leaving the further development of Bitcoin in the hands of open-source software developers.

The underlying blockchain technology that powers Bitcoin proved to be transformative beyond the realm of money. It paved the way for decentralized finance (DeFi) and created rich business environments, enabling various applications and use cases.

Moreover, blockchain consensus mechanisms showcased their potential for supporting improved governance structures. By employing smart contracts and cryptoeconomics, collective action problems could be resolved in innovative ways.

However, over time, Bitcoin's political vision has undergone changes. While it initially sought to disrupt the traditional financial system, it is now widely used as a speculative asset. Despite this shift, Bitcoin has continued to find relevance, particularly among millennials and Gen Z. These younger generations have embraced Bitcoin, reigniting interest in Nakamoto's original vision, especially amid ongoing global economic challenges.



## The Curse of the Awesome Button
Author: Will Oremus

In 2007, when Facebook boasted 30 million users, there was a notable absence of a straightforward way for users to express interest in each other's posts. To tackle this issue, Leah Pearlman and her team devised the concept of the "awesome button," which would later be known as the ubiquitous "like" button. This feature aimed to enhance user engagement and interaction on the platform.

Despite its potential, Mark Zuckerberg initially turned down the idea, expressing concerns about privacy implications, conflicts with the ad platform, and other competing features. Nonetheless, after further consideration, the like button received approval and was officially launched in February 2009. It quickly gained immense popularity and became an integral part of the Facebook experience.

The introduction of likes revolutionized how users interacted with content. Likes transformed into expressions of taste and identity, significantly influencing Facebook's news-feed ranking algorithm. Additionally, they served as a valuable data source for the company to understand user preferences and behaviors better.

However, over time, the like button's impact had unintended consequences. It led to the simplification of engagement and content, often favoring shallow and simplistic posts over nuanced and thoughtful ones. This shift had detrimental effects on media companies, as they felt the pressure to generate likes to remain competitive on Facebook. This demand gave rise to manipulative clickbait tactics and pandering discourse, undermining the quality of online discussions.

Furthermore, the like button's influence extended beyond the platform itself. It played a role in facilitating the rise of populist politicians who adeptly exploited biases and fears to garner likes and support.

Recognizing the negative impact, Facebook and other social networks have started experimenting with removing like counters from posts to mitigate some of these issues. However, the full extent of the consequences and whether these changes will effectively address the problems remain uncertain.

The creators of the like button acknowledge that its harmful effects may reflect inherent aspects of human nature and the complex dynamics of social media platforms. They acknowledge that its widespread adoption and consequences might have been an inevitable consequence in the ever-evolving landscape of online interactions.

## The Volkswagen Emissions Scandal: How Digital Systems Can Be Used to Cheat
Author: Lee Vinsel

In September 2015, Volkswagen found itself embroiled in a major scandal when it was discovered that the company had been using computer software to cheat air pollution tests. This revelation sent shockwaves through the automotive industry and raised concerns about the potential misuse of software as a means to circumvent regulations and democratic values.

The regulatory context for emissions control in vehicles was established by the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1970 in the United States. As computerization was introduced into automobiles to better manage emissions and improve environmental standards, it inadvertently created opportunities for unscrupulous behavior, as evidenced by the Volkswagen case.

Volkswagen's deceitful actions involved using sophisticated software to detect when the vehicle was undergoing emissions tests. During these test conditions, the software would modify the vehicle's operations to appear compliant with pollution laws. However, under normal driving conditions, the vehicles emitted pollutants at levels far exceeding the legal limits.

The scandal served as a stark reminder of the need for regulations to keep pace with technological advancements. It highlighted the importance of ensuring that regulations are designed to prevent such manipulations and hold companies accountable for their actions. Additionally, the incident underscored the significance of upholding widely shared values, such as environmental protection and public health, in the face of emerging technologies and their potential misuse.

## Telegram: The Platform That Became "the Internet" in Iran
Author: “Mahsa Alimardani and Afsaneh Rigot”

The Iranian authorities perceive the Internet as a threat and, therefore, make efforts to control it in the name of national security. Despite this, Telegram, a messaging and social media app, gained immense popularity in Iran primarily due to its open API. The open API allowed users to resist censorship and access information more easily, making it a valuable tool for accessing uncensored content.

Telegram channels provided a platform for media organizations to reach millions of users in Iran, delivering content that would otherwise be subject to censorship. Consequently, the Iranian government repeatedly considered blocking Telegram to prevent the free flow of information.

Even though Telegram was officially banned, it continues to be widely used in Iran, thanks to circumvention tools such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs). These tools enable users to access Telegram and other blocked platforms, defying government restrictions.

Initially marketed as a secure messenger, Telegram faced scrutiny regarding its security features. The Iranian government exploited infiltration methods to identify and target users, leading to concerns about user privacy and safety.

For the LGBTQ+ community in Iran, Telegram served as a safe space for communication and connection. However, it also became a target for law enforcement infiltration, leading to arrests and threats to users' safety.

Following the censorship of Telegram, the LGBTQ+ community had to resort to riskier online tools to access blocked platforms, further compromising their privacy and security.

As of now, WhatsApp has emerged as the most widely used social application in Iran. Nonetheless, Telegram played a significant role in facilitating connections and information sharing for Iranians, despite the risks involved in using the platform.


## Encoding Gender
Author: Meredith Broussard

Jonathan Ferguson, a 40-year-old technical writer, made a significant announcement in 1958 in the UK by revealing his gender transition. His experience at that time highlighted the relative ease of changing gender compared to the challenges faced by many today. However, computer systems and databases in the 1950s were not designed to accommodate diverse gender identities. These fixed gender values persisted and have influenced many aspects of modern technology.

Even today, most computer systems encode gender as a binary value, despite the evolving understanding of gender and the recognition of LGBTQIA+ rights. As the understanding of gender expands to encompass a wide spectrum of identities, the next frontier in gender rights involves making computer databases more inclusive to accommodate this diversity.

Historically, computer programming has largely ignored discussions of gender, except in translation contexts. However, when same-sex marriage was legalized, thousands of database schemas needed to be updated, and this process was informally referred to as "Y2gay."

While platforms like Facebook now offer users the ability to self-identify with over 50 genders, the underlying data is still often stored as male, female, or null, reflecting hegemonic heteronormativity and limitations in mathematical representations.

Computers process information using binary code, represented as 0s and 1s. This binary nature affects how gender is stored and represented in databases. Database design decisions can have social consequences, as they reflect the values of those who create them.

A study on automated gender recognition from 1995 to 2017 revealed that assumptions of gender being binary, immutable, and/or physiological were prevalent in database design choices. For example, using Boolean variables for gender may reflect normative aesthetics but can be exclusionary to nonbinary individuals.

Efforts have been made to change outdated university systems to be more inclusive of gender identity, but it requires both determination and funding to achieve this.

In the United States, progress has been made in recognizing nonbinary identities, with 19 states and Washington, DC, mandating a third gender option (X) on official state documents.

Despite these advancements, change in both computer systems and society at large can be slow, and compliance with inclusive legislation can still be a challenge. Computer systems are not just mathematical constructs; they are sociotechnical systems that need regular updates to reflect evolving social values. Embracing diversity and creating more inclusive technology is an ongoing journey that requires collaboration and commitment.
