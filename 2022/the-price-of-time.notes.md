# The Price of Time
Edward Chancellor (2022)

## The Anarchist and the Capitalist
- Historical debate between Pierre-Joseph Proudhon (anarchist) and Frédéric Bastiat (capitalist) in 1849
- Debate centered around legitimacy of interest rates
- Proudhon argued interest was theft and inequality; Bastiat defended interest as fair reward for services
- Proudhon's criticisms of interest: negative effects on debt, wealth distribution, class antagonism
- Proudhon proposed monetary reforms: nationalizing bank, reducing interest rates, taxing capital
- Bastiat argued interest incentivized saving, allocated capital efficiently, fostered economic growth
- Warning against abolishing interest: hindrance to lending, savings, overall prosperity
- Enduring relevance of debate: low interest rates coincide with speculative manias, credit booms
- Complexity of interest: theories, connection to economic growth, influence of monetary policy
- Importance of interest in guiding capital allocation, valuing investments, incentivizing saving, managing risk, regulating financial markets, impacting income distribution
- Contrasting views of Proudhon and Bastiat showcase multifaceted nature of interest and its significance in economic systems.

## How Low Rates Begot Lower Rates
- Super low interest rates after the financial crisis led to unconventional monetary policies
- Central banks implemented measures like quantitative easing and artificially suppressed interest rates
- These actions aimed to stimulate the economy and stabilize financial markets
- However, unintended consequences arose and desired outcomes were not achieved
- Low rates led to a search for higher yields and increased risk-taking by investors
- Lending standards were lowered by underwriters chasing higher returns
- The carry trade and challenges in regulating financial risks were discussed
- Despite increased regulations, loopholes were found and mishaps occurred
- Negative interest rates were then implemented as a further attempt to stimulate growth
- Initially considered absurd, they were adopted by several central banks
- Negative rates had unintended consequences, struggling to pass on costs to depositors
- Solvency problems in the financial system also arose
- Negative rates failed to boost investment or bring inflation up to target levels
- Concerns were raised by economists and investors about the negative effects of these rates
- Critics argue that they hinder banks' ability to create money, induce deflationary mindset, and undermine business confidence
- The overall impact on the wider financial system and capital allocation is questioned
- Prolonged low rates led to a cascade of unconventional policies, but they had unintended consequences and did not achieve intended goals
- This highlights the complexities of manipulating interest rates and the financial system.

## The Game of Marbles
- China unleashed a massive stimulus package in response to the 2008 global financial crisis
- The stimulus fueled a credit binge and increased state control over the economy
- This resulted in a surge of investment, particularly in infrastructure projects
- However, it also led to overcapacity in industries like steel and cement
- Excessive debt, state-owned enterprises, and shadow banking created a risky financial environment
- Informal lending systems, like the one in Wenzhou, emerged and fueled speculation, especially in real estate
- Wealth inequality grew, with the richest 1% controlling a significant portion of the country's wealth
- China's authoritarian turn under President Xi Jinping intensified surveillance and control mechanisms
- Financial repression, including manipulation of interest rates and capital controls, hindered market-driven reforms
- Capital flight and hindered productivity growth were consequences of financial repression
- Challenges and contradictions arise from the clash between state control and people's aspirations for a better life in China's economy
