# The Price of Time: The Real Story of Interest
Author: Edward Chancellor

## Introduction: The Anarchist and the Capitalist
- Debate between Proudhon and Bastiat on Interest:
  - The debate between Pierre-Joseph Proudhon and Frédéric Bastiat centered around the legitimacy and effects of interest.
  - Proudhon, an anarchist, argued that interest was unjust, usurious, and led to inequality and poverty.
  - Bastiat, a free-trade advocate, saw interest as a fair reward for mutual exchange of services, highlighting time's value.
  - Proudhon proposed nationalizing banks, reducing interest, and introducing a tax on capital to address inequality.
  - Bastiat opposed Proudhon's ideas, foreseeing negative consequences for borrowing, capital, and economic stability.
- Unintended Consequences of Ultra-Low Interest Rates:
  - After the 2008 Lehman Brothers bankruptcy, central bankers adopted Proudhon-like low interest rates to calm markets.
  - The initial visible effects included reduced unemployment and economic stability, but secondary consequences emerged.
  - William White warned that low rates led to increased spending, less saving, misallocated capital, and excessive risk-taking.
  - Ultra-easy money contributed to the misallocation of capital, discouraged normal thrift, and slowed productivity growth.
- Impact of Ultra-Low Interest Rates on Emerging Markets:
  - Low interest rates drove capital flows into emerging markets, boosting commodity prices and causing social and economic impacts.
  - Commodity price fluctuations, especially food prices, influenced events like the Arab Spring.
  - China's credit boom and real-estate bubble were fueled by low interest rates, leading to significant economic challenges.
- The Complexity of Interest and Its Roles:
  - The concept of interest is multifaceted, with various theories explaining its existence, including profitability, savings, finance, and investment valuation.
  - The debate between Keynesian views (rejecting the natural rate) and classical views (linking interest to profitability) persists.
  - Interest's relation to economic growth and demographics remains debated, with implications for natural rates.
  - Multiple interest rates exist, reflecting short-term, long-term, policy, market, and risk-based factors.
- Importance and Necessity of Interest:
  - Interest plays a pivotal role in a capitalist economy, directing capital allocation and valuing investments.
  - Interest incentivizes saving as a "reward for abstinence," factors in cost of leverage, price of risk, and market regulation.
  - Interest's effects extend to income and wealth distribution, foreign exchange, and influencing financial behavior.

## Of Historical Interest

### Babylonian Birth
- Ancient Origins and Evolution of Interest:
  - Interest has been a fundamental aspect of economic systems throughout history.
  - Ancient civilizations, like Babylon, Greece, and Rome, had interest-bearing loans with various rates and types.
  - Interest emerged due to the scarcity of resources, uneven wealth distribution, and the need to incentivize lending.
  - Different types of loans, risk premiums, and interest calculations were already present in ancient times.
  - Interest played a role in credit networks and periodic debt crises, similar to modern finance.
- Determinants of Interest Rates:
  - The level of interest rates in ancient civilizations showed a U-shaped curve, declining during periods of prosperity and rising in times of decline.
  - Interest rates remained stable for long periods, reflecting a mix of custom, law, market forces, and monetary changes.
  - The stability of interest rates contradicts some modern economic theories that link interest rates to economic growth or demographic changes.
- The Role and Necessity of Interest:
  - Interest rates reflected the necessity of inducing people to lend resources, rationing limited capital, and addressing unequal wealth distribution.
  - Interest rates were determined by a combination of need, greed, and the productive nature of loans.
  - Loans were essential for economic activities, production over time, and property markets.
  - Interest rates evolved alongside economic and societal changes, impacting civilizations' rise and fall.
- Implications and Lessons:
  - The importance of interest extends beyond its modern role in controlling inflation and economic output.
  - Understanding the historical origins of interest can provide insights into its essential role in credit systems.
  - Interest remains integral to economic systems due to the productive nature of loans and the time dimension of economic activities.

### Selling Time
- Historical Perspectives on Interest and Usury
  - The medieval Church's views on usury were influenced by the Scholastic denunciation, condemning charging interest on loans, especially for consumption purposes.
  - The distinction between consumer and commercial lending emerged as trade and industry expanded throughout the Middle Ages.
  - The concept of usury evolved, allowing interest on loans involving risk, business partnerships, and bottomry loans.
  - The Reformation brought changes in views on interest, and both Catholics and Protestants recognized its practical necessity.
  - Time started to be acknowledged as having value, and interest was increasingly associated with productive capital.
- Emergence of Interest and Time Preference
  - The idea of lending money with interest shifted from condemnation to acceptance as trade and commerce expanded.
  - The concept of time preference emerged, suggesting that immediate pleasures are valued more highly than future ones.
  - Turgot's concept of "a bird in the hand is worth two in the bush" expressed the essence of time preference.
  - Positive time preference became evident in studies like the famous "Marshmallow Test," showing that humans, especially children, tend to be impatient.
- Role of Time Preference in Economics
  - Time preference affects individual behaviors, investment decisions, and economic activities.
  - Various factors influence time preference, including stress, age, economic conditions, and personal preferences.
  - Time preference plays a crucial role in determining interest rates, influencing borrowing and saving behaviors.
- Interest as the Time Value of Money
  - Interest lies at the core of valuation and capital investment decisions.
  - Interest allows for comparing the present value of future cash flows and determines capital value.
  - The price of land and other assets is influenced by interest rates and their relation to future expectations.
  - Capital investments are guided by time preference, with businesses seeking returns that match or exceed the rate of interest.
- Challenges of Low Interest Rates
  - When interest rates are forced below their natural level, economic imbalances can arise.
  - Misguided investments and malinvestment occur when businesses adopt longer-term projects without sufficient returns.
  - Cheap credit driven by low interest rates can lead to excessive consumer debt and eventual economic crises.

### The Chimera
- Introduction:
  - The Mississippi Bubble was a historical financial event orchestrated by John Law in the early 18th century.
  - Law's financial System aimed to convert government debt into tradable shares, but it eventually led to a massive speculative bubble and its subsequent collapse.
- Creation of the Bubble:
  - John Law, a Scottish financier, established a System in France that involved the merging of the Royal Bank and the Mississippi Company.
  - Shares of the Mississippi Company were used as collateral for loans, and this led to the circulation of banknotes.
- Factors Leading to the Bubble:
  - Law's System initially promised prosperity, reduced government debt, and increased economic activity.
  - The decline in interest rates and the rise in property values contributed to the popularity of Law's System.
- The Bubble's Rise and Justifications:
  - Share prices soared, and dividends from the Mississippi Company appeared to justify the high valuation.
  - Law justified the high share price by pointing to low prevailing interest rates.
- Fall of the Bubble:
  - Law's System faced opposition from financiers and those threatened by his reforms.
  - Law manipulated the value of gold and silver to make banknotes attractive, leading to a loss of confidence in the currency.
  - Law's dictatorial measures and unstable monetary foundations undermined trust in the System.
- Impact and Analysis:
  - The collapse of the bubble led to financial ruin for many speculators and a severe loss of confidence in Law's System.
  - Modern economists have provided various perspectives on Law's System and its impact.
  - Some view Law's credit theory favorably and even draw parallels between his ideas and modern central banking policies.
- Parallels to Contemporary Economics:
  - The 2008 global financial crisis saw central banks using similar strategies to boost economic recovery, echoing Law's monetary experimentation.
  - Central bankers, like Ben Bernanke, Janet Yellen, and Mario Draghi, have resorted to printing money, manipulating interest rates, and fueling asset price bubbles.
  - The similarities between Law's System and modern central banking practices raise questions about their long-term effectiveness and potential consequences.

### John Bull Cannot Stand Two Per Cent
- Financial Speculation and Panics in History:
  - Shares in the Bank of England and the East India Company experienced speculative advances, driven by market conditions and geopolitical factors.
  - English merchants turned to South American trade due to the Continental Blockade by Napoleon, leading to an extraordinary surge in exports.
  - Speculative frenzy in the early 1800s led to excessive gambling, pushing boundaries and investments in impractical ventures.
  - The British railway mania in the 1840s saw a doubling of railway shares' index, with speculative fever fueled by easy money.
  - Overend Gurney's collapse in 1866 triggered financial panic, prompting discussions on the role of central banks during crises.
  - Bagehot's "Lombard Street" offered insights into central bank behavior as a lender of last resort during banking panics.
- Foreign Investments and Lending Mania:
  - Foreign lending mania emerged, driven by promises of high yields on foreign debt during periods of low domestic interest rates.
  - Latin American republics, such as Costa Rica, Dominican Republic, Paraguay, defaulted on loans, causing widespread distrust.
  - Egypt's financial difficulties and reliance on foreign loans were relieved by the sale of a stake in the Suez Canal.
  - Foreign bonds and investments faced challenges due to lack of trust, unsound credit practices, and defaults.
- Barings Crisis and Economic Challenges:
  - The decline in English long-term interest rates prompted the conversion of 3% Consols into lower-yield bonds, leading to financial speculation.
  - Flotation of the Irish brewer Guinness and a "South African fever" in mining stocks fueled stock market activity.
  - Investment trusts emerged as vehicles for middle-class savings due to inadequate returns on government securities.
  - The Argentine crisis of 1889 and corruption exposed in Buenos Aires contributed to financial panic.
  - Baring Brothers, a prominent bank, collapsed in 1890 due to its involvement in South America and insufficient risk assessment.
- Bagehot's Legacy and Modern Banking:
  - Bagehot's teachings on lender of last resort were popularized, emphasizing central bank intervention during crises.
  - Bagehot's warnings on the adverse effects of low interest rates and easy money were overlooked by modern central bankers.
  - Bagehot's legacy extends to modern times, but the lessons from "Lombard Street" have not been fully heeded.

### Un Petit Coup De Whisky
- Interest Rate Dynamics and Foreign Securities
  - Interest rates in Germany during the 1920s were much higher compared to the United States.
  - German call money rates were around 8½ per cent on average, significantly higher than US Treasury bill rates.
  - High yield foreign bonds in the US market were in demand, and foreign securities issuance peaked in 1927.
  - The credit quality of foreign securities deteriorated over the decade, leading to defaults.
  - The US economy became speculative, driven by rising stock prices, housing markets, and capital flows.
- Central Banking Decisions and Monetary Policy
  - A meeting of top central bankers in 1927 resulted in divisions over interest rate policies.
  - Strong and Montagu Norman proposed cheap money, while representatives of Reichsbank and Bank of France dissented.
  - The Federal Reserve cut interest rates despite disagreement within the Federal Reserve Board.
  - Economic growth and market speculation continued, but higher rates in the US triggered a reversal of capital flows.
  - Europe suffered gold losses, and central banks raised interest rates, contributing to the 1929 Wall Street crash.
- Debate on Price Stability and Monetary Policy
  - Economists held differing views on the impact of deflation and falling prices.
  - Wicksell warned about the dangers of deflation, while some believed that it could benefit workers and improve standards of living.
  - Hayek argued that not all deflation was harmful, and some forms were a natural result of technological improvements.
  - Hayek criticized the pursuit of price stability, as it hindered the natural adjustment process.
  - Hayek believed that bad deflation during crises was a symptom of earlier imbalances, not a direct cause.
- Impact of Monetary Policy on the Great Depression
  - The Great Depression narrative varies, with some blaming tight monetary policy and others pointing to the Gold Standard.
  - Friedman and Schwartz argued that the decline in the money supply and banking crises were key factors in the Great Depression.
  - Ben Bernanke's view was influenced by this narrative, leading him to prioritize avoiding deflation.
  - Historical evidence shows weak correlations between deflation and economic weakness in various periods.
  - Bernanke's commitment to preventing another Great Depression led him to take active measures during the 2008 financial crisis.
- Contrasting Views and the Legacy of Economic Theories
  - Hayek's predictions on deflation and crisis prevention were overlooked in favor of Fisher's views in the 1920s.
  - Bernanke acknowledged the mistakes of the 1930s and pledged to avoid repeating them.
  - Bernanke's commitment was put to the test during the 2008 financial crisis, where he took measures to prevent a similar catastrophe.

## How Low Rates Begot Lower Rates

### Goodhart's Law
- Inflation Targeting and Central Bank Policy
  - The pursuit of inflation targeting as a policy strategy by central banks became widespread in the 1990s, with the aim of achieving price stability and controlling inflation.
  - The Federal Reserve and other central banks adopted a 2% inflation target, considering it a global standard for policy implementation.
  - However, the effectiveness of inflation targeting came into question, especially after the 2008 financial crisis.
- Critiques of Inflation Targeting
  - William White and others criticized the inflation targeting approach, arguing that it was asymmetric and prone to overshooting.
  - White highlighted that central banks' fear of deflation led to a bias towards easing, potentially causing long-term issues.
  - The time period chosen for measuring inflation targets was criticized as inappropriate, and the real-time pursuit of targets faced limitations.
- The Obsession with Inflation Targets
  - After the 2008 crisis, central banks' obsession with hitting their inflation targets became pronounced.
  - Mario Draghi of the European Central Bank (ECB) and Haruhiko Kuroda of the Bank of Japan (BOJ) displayed strong commitment to their targets, even resorting to unconventional measures.
  - The pursuit of targets resembled a real-time experiment with global citizens as participants, as central bankers remained focused on targets over adverse consequences.
- Consequences and Concerns
  - Extreme monetary policies driven by inflation targeting had various negative impacts on economies and society.
  - Zero interest rates discouraged saving, investment, and productivity growth.
  - Ultra-low rates prolonged the survival of inefficient businesses, contributing to economic inefficiency.
  - Central bank policies led to rising inequality, financial instability, and the proliferation of asset price bubbles.
- Resistance to Critique
  - Despite growing criticisms and adverse outcomes, central bankers were resolute in sticking to their inflation targets.
  - They defended their actions by emphasizing the importance of maintaining price stability, regardless of collateral effects.

### Secular Stagnation
- Secular Stagnation: Past and Present
  - In the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis, the world initially saw a rapid recovery, but within a few years, it became evident that a more profound issue was affecting economies.
  - The concept of "secular stagnation" resurfaced, similar to a theory proposed in the 1930s by economists like Alvin Hansen and John Maynard Keynes.
  - This modern stagnation argument revolved around three key claims: slowing population growth, reduced investment demand due to new technologies, and a "global savings glut."
- Debating Demographics and Investment
  - The theory suggested that declining population growth in the United States and Europe, along with aging workforces, led to weaker economic prospects.
  - Claims that new technologies required less investment and were less productive were made, pointing to a shift in economic dynamics.
  - The idea of a "global savings glut" emerged, explaining falling interest rates during periods of weak growth.
- Critiques of Demographic Explanation
  - Some critics challenged the demographic explanation for stagnation, citing a lack of historical correlation between demographics and productivity growth.
  - Population growth rates contradicted the theory, as the actual growth exceeded the predicted slowdown.
  - Arguments arose whether demographic changes should influence interest rates or investment dynamics significantly.
- Technology and Capital Goods
  - Arguments were made that declining prices of capital goods and technology innovations might have contributed to falling interest rates.
  - However, the relationship between technology advancement, capital goods prices, and interest rates was complex and not well-established.
- Economic Efficiency and Innovation
  - The possibility that economic inefficiency and a lack of innovation were contributing to stagnation was proposed.
  - Some economists argued that the pessimism surrounding economic growth overlooked the potential for revolutionary new technologies.
- Overlooking Monetary and Financial Factors
  - While secular stagnation narratives focused on "real" factors like demographics and investment, the role of monetary and financial factors was underemphasized.
  - Historical context highlighted the impact of easy credit on economic cycles, as observed after the 1929 Crash and the 2008 crisis.
- Changing Perspectives
  - Larry Summers, a proponent of the secular stagnation theory, shifted his focus and questioned the role of ultra-low nominal yields in reducing aggregate demand and fostering financial instability.
  - The notion that ultra-low interest rates might be driving secular stagnation, rather than being a result of it, was introduced.

### The Raven of Basel

  - The Federal Reserve's attempts to manipulate interest rates through transparency and "forward guidance" were highlighted.
- The Natural Rate of Interest and Financial Cycles
  - Borio challenged the concept of the "natural rate" of interest, proposing his own financial cycle indicator based on credit growth and asset prices.
  - The stability of prices didn't necessarily indicate equilibrium market rates, as demonstrated by historical crises.
- Debt, Financial Imbalances, and Economic Growth
  - Debt accumulation and capital misallocation during credit booms reduced potential output growth.
  - Ultra-low interest rates enabled the accumulation of bad debts, slowing economic recovery and leading to zombie companies.
  - The "debt supercycle" emerged, where more debt required lower rates and vice versa.
- Global Implications and Cross-Border Capital Flows
  - Borio highlighted the excess elasticity of the international monetary system, leading to massive cross-border lending and capital flows.
  - Emerging markets accumulated foreign debts sensitive to Federal Reserve actions, resulting in global financial imbalances.
- Monetary Policy Challenges and Borio's Warning
  - Borio warned about the risks of extreme monetary policies, including zero and negative interest rates.

  - High-end properties in cities like New York and London rebounded from crisis-era losses, leading to soaring prices.
  - Investments in luxury real estate and art became prominent ways to store wealth, contributing to inequality.
- Financial Crisis Fallout and Uneven Impact
  - The financial crisis had uneven impacts on different segments of society.
  - Middle-class households suffered losses in wealth due to the property bust and stock market fluctuations.
  - Wealth inequality increased, with a large portion of private wealth hidden in offshore tax havens.
- Inequality and Economic Disparities

  - Rising inequality was linked to declines in social mobility and worsening economic prospects for the middle class.
  - While the rich got richer, many Americans faced stagnant or falling wages and rising living costs.
- Monetary Policy and Wealth Inequality
  - Ultra-low interest rates were a consequence of unconventional monetary policies after the financial crisis.
  - These policies disproportionately benefited the financial elite and contributed to asset price inflation.
  - Wealth bubbles, fueled by low interest rates, exacerbated wealth inequality and increased the concentration of wealth.
- Critique of Piketty's Theory
  - Thomas Piketty's "Capital in the Twenty-First Century" proposed that inequality rises when returns on capital exceed economic growth.
  - Piketty's fundamental law (r > g) came under scrutiny, with evidence showing inequality declining in countries where the gap between returns on capital and growth expanded.
  - Piketty's interchangeable use of 'capital' and 'wealth' was critiqued, as financial claims and productive assets were not distinguished.
- Alternative Explanation: The Iron Law of Inequality
  - An alternative explanation to inequality is the 'iron law of inequality' (r < g).
  - This formula suggests that when the rate of interest is held below the economy's growth rate, inequality increases.
  - The alternative formula helps explain changes in income and wealth distribution in different periods, including the post-Lehman decade.

### The Price of Anxiety
- Bond Market and Interest Rates:
  - Negative-yielding bonds are mistakenly considered "safe" assets, with warnings from experts like James Grant and Paul Singer.
  - Alan Greenspan also expressed concerns about unsustainable low long-term interest rates, likening it to a bond bubble.
  - During Greenspan's tenure at the Federal Reserve, he failed to identify bubbles, while central banks kept interest rates low and inflation in check.
  - The concept of interest compensating for liquidity sacrifice has historical roots and is still relevant in modern bond markets.
- Liquidity Risk:
  - Liquidity, valued in bond markets, causes less liquid securities to have higher yields.
  - Low interest rates led to investors sacrificing liquidity for extra income, investing in illiquid "shadow banking" products.
  - After the 2008 financial crisis, new shadow-banking systems with similarities to their predecessors emerged.
  - Liquidity risk was exacerbated by new banking regulations, leading to decreased turnover in the bond markets.
- Price of Volatility:
  - Volatility and liquidity are inversely related; volatility increases as liquidity decreases.
  - Volatility is seen as a measure of risk and the price of uncertainty in finance.
  - The VIX index measures US stock market volatility; quantitative easing aimed to reduce market volatility.
  - The proliferation of low volatility resulted in new financial strategies and asset classes.
- Central Bank Actions and Financial Behavior:
  - Central bankers adopted a plausible deniability attitude toward the bond bubble and increased credit risk.
  - Central banks denied causing the collapse in long-term interest rates, attributing it to supply and demand.
  - Ultra-low interest rates encouraged investors to chase yield, disregarding risk.
  - Regulation and monetary policy conflicted; monetary policy encouraged risk-taking while regulations attempted to control it.
  - Regulatory arbitrage allowed financial institutions to exploit loopholes in regulations, despite increased oversight.
  - Ultra-low rates redirected savings from regulated banking to credit markets, altering systemic risk's origin.
- Challenges and Solutions:
  - Ultra-low interest rates prompted investors to take on more risk, leading to financial instability.
  - Activist central banks' interventions and low-interest rates influenced Wall Street's behavior and created moral hazard.
  - Removing extraordinary measures was feared to induce financial turmoil, highlighting the dilemma of raising interest rates.
  - The low rate environment resulted in a million carry trades and persistent financial fragility, reinforcing the need for low rates.

## The Game of Marbles

### The Mother and Father of All Evil
- Introduction: The Dollar Standard and Interest Rates
  - The US dollar became the global reserve currency after the collapse of the Bretton Woods system in 1971.
  - Dollar-denominated securities like US Treasury bonds replaced gold in central bank reserves.
  - The Dollar Standard's defining characteristic is its extreme elasticity, with no limit on issuing dollar-denominated securities.
  - The United States benefits from this privilege by running deficits and borrowing without constraint.
- Impact of Interest Rates on International Capital Flows
  - Interest rates have historically regulated international capital flows.
  - During the Gold Standard era, lower rates in one country led to gold outflows and higher rates.
  - Under the Dollar Standard, dollar-pegged countries must align with US monetary policy.
  - Easy money policies in the US have a global impact, causing cross-border lending and carry trades.
- Phases of Global Liquidity
  - Early 2000s saw a surge in central bank reserves, often attributed to a "global savings glut."
  - The growth in reserves was fueled by cross-border capital flows and easy money policies.
  - The first phase of liquidity led to credit booms and real estate bubbles in Europe.
  - The second phase after the 2008 crisis brought foreign capital to emerging markets.
- Emerging Markets and Debt Accumulation
  - Low interest rates in developed countries led to excessive debt in emerging markets.
  - Non-financial debt in developing countries rose from 107% to 192% of GDP between 2008 and 2018.
  - Foreign dollar loans exceeded $11 trillion, with emerging markets accumulating significant debt.
  - Much of this borrowing was poorly invested or used for financial engineering.
- Impact of Globalization on Interest Rates
  - Globalization and interest rates are interconnected: increased trade reduces inflation and wage growth, affecting rates.
  - In the modern era of globalization (from 1980), emerging markets gained trade share and jobs were offshored.
  - Globalization reduced inflation and wage growth, allowing central banks to lower interest rates.
  - Longer supply chains developed, requiring ample financing and contributing to the expansion of world trade.
- Challenges to Globalization and Emerging Markets
  - Emerging markets became more sensitive to shifts in US monetary policy.
  - Trade tensions, Brexit, and capital controls challenged globalization.
  - The "persistent expansionary bias" of the international monetary system caused imbalances.
  - Emerging markets' vulnerability to US monetary policy increased, demanding lower rates to avoid crises.
- The Future and Consequences of Globalization
  - The risks of failing to reform the international monetary system include instability, protectionism, and stagnation.
  - The Dollar Standard's crises have become more costly and widespread over time.
  - The impact of globalization on historic bubbles raises questions about its sustainability.
