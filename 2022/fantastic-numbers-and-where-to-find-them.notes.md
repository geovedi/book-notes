  - On July 4, 2012, CERN announced the discovery of a new particle, believed to be the Higgs boson.
  - The Higgs boson, responsible for giving mass to other particles, was a triumph for both theory and experiment.
  - However, a dark secret accompanied this discovery - the mass of the Higgs boson was unexpectedly light.
  - The Higgs should be much heavier based on its role and properties in physics.
  - The Higgs boson's mass is approximately 125 GeV, which is almost a billion billion times lighter than expected.
- Unsettling Nature of the Higgs Boson's Mass:
  - The Higgs boson's mass is remarkably small - around 2.2 x 10^-25 kilograms.
  - This mass is close to that of a fairyfly, the smallest insect, and even a quantum black hole.
  - The Higgs should have a mass similar to a few micrograms, making it a particle heavyweight.
  - However, it's actually much lighter, around the same mass as a fairyfly.
- Questioning the Unusual Smallness:
  - The Higgs boson's mass being so small raises questions about the underlying physics.
  - In the natural world, numbers that are too big or too small are usually exceptional and demand an explanation.
  - The concept of "naturalness" suggests that theories should avoid unexplained and finely tuned inputs.
- Naturalness in Physics:
  - Naturalness is the idea that theories should avoid having unexplained and finely tuned parameters.
  - Small numbers in theories should be justifiable through an understanding of the underlying physics.
  - Naturalness is an aesthetic criterion used to guide theory selection, often when experimental data is lacking.
- Examples of Naturalness in Nature:
  - Naturalness is seen in various aspects of physics, such as the photon's vanishing mass due to gauge symmetry.
  - The internal structure of protons and neutrons also involves naturalness, with gluons having vanishing mass.
  - The electron's lightness is explained by an approximate symmetry, preventing it from becoming too heavy and destabilizing atoms.
- Challenges with the Higgs Boson's Mass:
