# Ego: What is Ego
**Authors**: Redik Kuluev | **Year**: 2022 | **Category**: Philosophy & Critical Thinking

## Summary
This book presents ego as an illusion created by the brain during human evolution, particularly in the left hemisphere. When our ancestors first became self-aware by recognizing themselves as separate individuals, they created the illusion of ego—a mental construct that perceives itself as the "I" that experiences everything. This false identification with the ego illusion is the root cause of all human suffering.

The book explains how the ego illusion functions as a collection of neural connections linking the self-image with all other images perceived as important for maintaining its existence. When reality doesn't match the ego's mental models, stress hormones are released, and suffering ensues. By abandoning this false world model and embracing true reality, one can achieve lasting peace and happiness.

## Core Insights

### The Brain's Hemispheric Division
The right hemisphere processes the present moment—sights, sounds, smells, tactile sensations as they occur. The left hemisphere stores information, images, and memories, processing what the right hemisphere transmits by comparing it with past experiences and planning for the future. This constant comparison creates memory and future planning, but also leads to the ego's creation.

### The Birth of Ego Illusion
The ego illusion emerged when an ancestor, observing another individual, first asked "Who is the one who sees this individual?" This moment of self-recognition created an image in the left hemisphere that began identifying itself as "I." This image grew increasingly connected with all other mental images until everything was perceived through the ego's prism.

> "One of images that created the human brain in evolutionary process—this is an illusion Ego. At this moment formed consciousness. The man began to realize himself. And precisely because of this illusion of ego, man and suffers all his life. Because of this false image, which not."

**Quick Take**: Your ego isn't real—it's a mental construct your brain created for evolutionary survival, and it's causing your suffering.

### The Three Core Fears
The ego illusion generates three fundamental fears: fear of death (the greatest connection), fear of loneliness, and fear of going crazy when alone. To neutralize these fears, the ego strengthens itself by becoming increasingly attached to images and trying to increase their presence and availability 24/7.

### Attachment and Suffering
The ego creates attachments to images of how things "should" be, including material objects and their desired characteristics. Any deviation from these mental images is perceived as a threat to the ego's existence, which it attempts to correct through violence or control. This leads to a cycle of desire, action, and suffering when reality fails to match the ego's expectations.

### Liberation Through Reality
Freedom comes when you abandon the false world model built by the brain and live in true reality. Instead of trying to force reality to match your mental images, accept things as they are. When you stop this struggle, stress hormones cease, and you begin enjoying everything as it is.

> "Giving up a false model of the world built by the brain in order to perceive the world a person begins to live in true reality. Stop struggling with true reality. Man begins to live in true reality. Begins to enjoy everything. AND ceases to worry that true reality is not corresponds to false model built in his brain."

**Quick Take**: You already have everything you need—stop fighting reality and start enjoying what already exists.

## Best Quotes
- "Thus, you already have everything and instead of enjoying all that you already there is. You start trying to accumulate what is already yours and dying in the eternal struggle for what and so is yours"
- "Man instead of abandoning false model of the world from illusions of the ego. Trying to adjust the true reality under the false model of the world, which he himself invented. BUT he never can force, for example, another person to do everything as he needs, therefore he and suffers."
- "An Ego Illusion has been created. Image recorded in left hemisphere began to be perceived as real as I. this image began to grow bigger and bigger big connections not yet became a system-like manner with the most connections with in other ways if not with all images in the brain."

## Action Items
- **Recognize the ego's voice**: Notice when your thoughts are creating expectations about how things "should" be
- **Practice present-moment awareness**: Focus on sensory experiences rather than mental narratives
- **Release attachments**: Allow reality to be as it is without trying to control outcomes
- **Observe your suffering**: When you feel stressed or upset, identify which mental image reality is violating
- **Accept impermanence**: Recognize that everything changes and nothing can be permanently controlled

## Questions to Consider
- What mental images am I fighting to maintain right now?
- How much of my suffering comes from reality not matching my expectations?
- What would it feel like to experience this moment without any story about it?
- If my ego isn't real, then who is experiencing this life?
- What attachments am I willing to release today?

## Conclusion
This book offers a radical but practical perspective on ego as the root of human suffering. While the translation quality may be challenging, the core insight—that our ego is an illusion causing unnecessary struggle—is profound and potentially life-changing. The book's greatest strength is its clear explanation of how ego functions and creates suffering through mental attachments.

Is it worth your time? Yes, if you're ready for a fundamental shift in how you understand yourself and your suffering. The biggest reason to read it is that it provides both a theoretical understanding of ego's mechanics and a clear path to liberation through abandoning false mental models. While the writing style may be dense, the central message—that peace comes from accepting reality rather than fighting it—is universally applicable and deeply transformative.
