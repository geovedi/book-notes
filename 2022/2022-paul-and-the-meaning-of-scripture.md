# Paul and the Meaning of Scripture

**Original Title**: Paul and the Meaning of Scripture
**Authors**: Matthew L. Halsted | **Year**: 2022 | **Category**: Spirituality & Religion

## Summary

This groundbreaking academic work explores how the Apostle Paul interpreted and used Old Testament Scriptures in his letter to the Romans, offering a fresh philosophical-hermeneutic perspective. Halsted challenges traditional evangelical approaches to biblical interpretation by demonstrating that Paul frequently read new meanings into ancient texts—meanings that went beyond their original contexts. The book applies Hans-Georg Gadamer's philosophical hermeneutics to understand Paul's creative yet disciplined approach to Scripture, arguing that Paul's method should be understood as "dialogical re-authoring."

The book is essential for biblical scholars, theologians, students of hermeneutics, and anyone interested in understanding how biblical interpretation works across time and cultures. Readers will gain a sophisticated framework for understanding how ancient texts can speak meaningfully to contemporary situations without losing their integrity or becoming mere objects of subjective manipulation.

## Core Insights

### The Pauline Hermeneutic Challenge

Traditional evangelical interpretation often operates by the mantra: "The Bible will never mean something it never meant." However, as Halsted demonstrates, Paul himself would fail this modern hermeneutical test spectacularly. Paul routinely interpreted Old Testament texts in ways that went far beyond their original contexts and meanings. For instance, in Romans 9:25-26, Paul takes Hosea's prophecy about Israel's restoration and applies it to Gentile inclusion in the church—a complete recontextualization of the original meaning.

> "Paul's own mantra is straightforward: The Bible will always mean something new, fresh, and surprising—like it always meant to."

This doesn't mean Paul was an interpretive quark who could make texts mean whatever he wanted. Rather, his interpretations operated within a disciplined framework that balanced creative freedom with deep respect for Scripture. Paul's method reveals a sophisticated hermeneutic that modern readers would do well to understand rather than dismiss.

**Quick Take**: Biblical interpretation is not about discovering static, timeless meanings frozen in ancient contexts, but about entering into a dynamic dialogue where texts can speak anew to contemporary situations.

### Gadamerian Philosophical Hermeneutics

Halsted employs Hans-Georg Gadamer's philosophical hermeneutics to make sense of Paul's interpretive approach. Gadamer argued that understanding is not a objective reconstruction of historical meaning but rather a "fusion of horizons" between the interpreter's world and the text's world. Key Gadamerian concepts include:

- **Pre-judgments (Vorurteil)**: Rather than being obstacles to understanding, our preconceptions and assumptions are the very conditions that make understanding possible. They serve as entry points into meaningful engagement with texts.

- **Fusion of Horizons (Horizontverschmelzung)**: Understanding occurs when the horizon of the text's historical world merges with the horizon of the interpreter's contemporary world, creating new meaning in the process.

- **Application (Anwendung)**: Understanding is inseparable from application. We don't first understand a text and then apply it; understanding itself is an applicative event where the text speaks to our present situation.

> "History does not belong to us; we belong to it."

Gadamer's approach provides a framework that accounts for both Paul's respect for Scripture and his creative engagement with it. Paul wasn't abandoning the original meaning of Old Testament texts, but allowing those texts to speak into his new Christ-centered reality in ways that created fresh meaning.

**Quick Take**: Understanding biblical texts requires acknowledging our historical situatedness and embracing the dynamic interplay between text, tradition, and contemporary application.

### Dialogical Re-authoring

Halsted's central thesis is that Paul's use of Scripture should be understood as "dialogical re-authoring." This concept captures two fundamental aspects of Paul's interpretive method:

1. **Dialogical**: Paul approaches Scripture as a conversation partner, not as a mere resource to be mined for proof-texts. The text speaks to Paul, and Paul speaks back to the text, creating a genuine dialogue that shapes both interpreter and text.

2. **Re-authoring**: While respecting the original author's voice, Paul allows the text to speak in new ways for new situations. This isn't arbitrary rewriting but inspired authoring that participates in God's ongoing revelation.

This approach explains how Paul could take Hosea's prophecy about Israel and apply it to Gentiles without violating the text's integrity. The text wasn't being twisted but was being allowed to speak into a new chapter in God's redemptive story.

> "For Paul, the Bible will always mean something new, fresh, and surprising—like it always meant to."

This model avoids both the extreme of rigid literalism (which would condemn Paul's method) and the extreme of relativistic interpretation (which would allow any meaning whatsoever). Instead, it offers a via media that honors both the stability of Scripture and the dynamic work of the Spirit in applying it to new contexts.

**Quick Take**: Faithful biblical interpretation involves entering into dialogue with Scripture that allows texts to speak authoritatively into new situations while maintaining their essential integrity.

### The Role of Experience and Tradition

Gadamer's emphasis on historically-effected consciousness helps explain how Paul's Damascus Road experience shaped his entire approach to Scripture. That encounter with the risen Christ didn't invalidate Paul's Jewish interpretive training; it transformed it, providing a new lens through which he read the Hebrew Scriptures.

This highlights several important insights:

- **Experience Shapes Interpretation**: Our encounters with God—particularly through Christ—fundamentally shape how we read Scripture. Paul's Christ experience wasn't an obstacle to understanding the Old Testament but the key to understanding its true meaning.

- **Tradition Makes Interpretation Possible**: Rather than being barriers to understanding, our traditions and pre-understandings are necessary starting points for meaningful engagement with texts. Paul's Jewish background wasn't something to overcome but the foundation for his Christian interpretation.

- **Understanding is Existential**: Interpretation isn't merely an intellectual exercise but an existential event where who we are shapes what we see, and what we see shapes who we are.

This approach helps explain why different Christian traditions can read the same biblical texts and arrive at different yet faithful applications. The diversity isn't necessarily evidence of interpretation gone wrong but of the rich, multifaceted way Scripture speaks across different contexts.

**Quick Take**: Our experiences and traditions aren't obstacles to biblical interpretation but the very lenses through which Scripture can speak meaningfully to our situations.

### Beyond Method: Understanding as Event

Traditional hermeneutics often searches for the right method to guarantee correct interpretation. Gadamer, however, argues that understanding is less about method and more about the event of meaning that happens when text and interpreter meet. This has several implications:

- **No Method Can Guarantee Understanding**: There's no foolproof method that can eliminate the need for faith, wisdom, and community in the interpretive process. Understanding is always a gift as much as an achievement.

- **Understanding is Always Transformative**: When we truly understand a biblical text, we are changed by it. The text doesn't just inform us; it forms us and shapes our way of being in the world.

- **Community is Essential**: Understanding happens best in community where we can test our interpretations against the wisdom of others and across time. Paul didn't interpret Scripture in isolation but in the context of the Christian community.

This doesn't mean that anything goes in interpretation. Rather, it means that faithful interpretation requires more than methodological precision—it requires virtue, wisdom, and openness to the Spirit's leading in the community of faith.

**Quick Take**: Biblical understanding is not merely a methodological achievement to be mastered but a transformative event to be experienced in the context of Christian community.

- "History does not belong to us; we belong to it."

- "For those of us who grew up learning how to interpret the Bible within the context of American evangelicalism, such statements are well known. In fact, in some narrow sectors of that movement, the mantra functions as a sort of creed, the affirmation of which is necessary to ensure hermeneutic faithfulness."

- "What is interesting, though, is that St. Paul seems to have never received the memo."

- "A 'pure reading' of texts is simply a myth. No reader finds meaning in a text until he or she approaches the text in a meaningful way."

- "With a nod to St. Paul himself, I often tell people that there is no one who is unbiased, for all are human and fall short of the glory of a god-like objective interpretation."

- "My conclusion, perhaps controversial, is that Paul's use of Scripture ought to be described as dialogical re-authoring."

- "Gadamer's hermeneutic offers a paradigm by which we can understand how Paul engaged scriptural texts—without requiring us to fall into the snare of frenzied relativism or retreat toward a naïve quest for hermeneutic objectivity."

## Action Items

- **Embrace Interpretive Humility**: Recognize that your interpretations are shaped by your historical and cultural context. Approach Scripture with awareness of your presuppositions rather than pretending to be objective.

- **Value Tradition While Remaining Open**: Honor the interpretive traditions you've inherited while remaining open to how the Spirit might be leading you to read texts in new ways for contemporary situations.

- **Read Scripture Dialogically**: Approach biblical texts as conversation partners rather than mere resources to be mined for information. Allow texts to question you as much as you question them.

- **Interpret in Community**: Don't interpret Scripture in isolation. Engage with the wisdom of the broader Christian community across time and space.

- **Look for Christ-Centered Meaning**: Like Paul, read the Old Testament in light of Christ's life, death, and resurrection, allowing this Christological lens to illuminate familiar texts in new ways.

- **Balance Freedom and Fidelity**: Cultivate both creative freedom and disciplined faithfulness in your interpretation. Avoid both the rigidity that prevents fresh insight and the license that leads to arbitrary interpretation.

## Questions to Consider

- How might your own cultural and historical context be shaping the way you read biblical texts?

- In what ways might you be operating under unexamined hermeneutical assumptions that need to be challenged?

- How can you distinguish between legitimate creative interpretation and undisciplined eisegesis?

- What role should Christian community play in shaping and testing your interpretations?

- How might your personal encounters with Christ be transforming the way you read Scripture?

- What might it look like to approach biblical texts as dialogue partners rather than objects to be analyzed?

- How can you maintain faithfulness to Scripture while remaining open to fresh insights and applications?
