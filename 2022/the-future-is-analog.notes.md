## Wednesday: Commerce
- Emergence of Third-Party Delivery (3PD) Apps and Challenges:
  - The rise of third-party delivery (3PD) apps revolutionized the way people order food, promising convenience and choice.
  - These apps connected customers with a variety of restaurants and cuisines, using digital technology to streamline the ordering and delivery process.
  - However, the success of these apps came with various challenges for both restaurants and customers.
- The Broken Model of Third-Party Delivery:
  - Initially seen as a positive change, 3PD apps later became problematic for restaurants due to high commission fees and loss of customer data control.
  - The deceptive practices of some apps, like unauthorized listings and hidden fees, highlighted the negative consequences of the app-dominated market.
  - Restaurants were often forced to surrender a significant portion of their profits to these apps, leading to financial strain.
- The Pandemic's Impact on Third-Party Delivery:
  - The COVID-19 pandemic further magnified the problems with 3PD apps, as reliance on delivery grew due to lockdowns.
  - Despite the surge in orders, restaurants struggled to make profits due to high commission rates and unfavorable terms set by the apps.
  - Many restaurants faced difficulties in delivering food that met quality standards, leading to customer complaints and dissatisfaction.
- Hopeful Alternatives:
  - Alternative models, such as locally owned cooperative platforms like Loco.Coop and Captain, emerged to counter the dominance of 3PD apps.
  - These platforms aimed to empower restaurants by allowing them to own and operate the technology behind their delivery services.
  - By sharing the costs and benefits of the platform, restaurants could reduce fees, retain customer data, and provide better service.
- Restoring Balance and Local Control:
  - The rise of platform cooperatives like Loco.Coop represented a shift back toward locally controlled commerce.
  - Such cooperatives were founded by restaurant owners to provide a better alternative to the centralized control of 3PD apps.
  - These platforms aimed to foster collaboration, transparency, and shared ownership, allowing businesses to thrive while retaining control.
- The Power of Local and Human-Centered Commerce:
  - The digitization of commerce promised convenience but also led to the loss of many important aspects of shopping and dining experiences.
  - The human element, personal interactions, and unique characteristics of local businesses were eroded in the digital transition.
  - Locally focused platforms like Loco.Coop and Captain aimed to restore the essence of commerce by prioritizing customer relationships and community.
- A Reevaluation of Digital Convenience:
  - The pandemic prompted people to realize the drawbacks of over-reliance on online commerce.
  - Convenience came at the cost of losing the richness and human connection that physical businesses offered.
  - The excessive focus on online convenience forced a reevaluation of the value of the overall shopping and dining experience.
- Future Possibilities for a Balanced Approach:
  - The digital future of commerce should be rooted in a balance between online convenience and the unique characteristics of local businesses.
  - Platform cooperatives and locally owned models offered an alternative to the dominant 3PD apps, allowing for equitable distribution of benefits.
  - This reimagined approach could lead to a more fulfilling and sustainable future for commerce, where technology empowers rather than replaces the human touch.
