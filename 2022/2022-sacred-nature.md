# Sacred Nature
**Authors**: Nicola Laneri, Anna Perdibon | **Year**: 2022

## Summary
"Sacred Nature" explores how ancient cultures understood and engaged with the natural world as a living, sacred community rather than as mere resources to exploit. The book challenges the Western nature/culture dichotomy and introduces a new understanding of animism as a relational worldview where humans, animals, plants, landscapes, and even objects participate as persons in a shared cosmic community. Through interdisciplinary research spanning archaeology, anthropology, and religious studies, the contributors reveal how ancient peoples across the globe—from Arctic America to Mesopotamia, from ancient Greece to the Biblical world—experienced nature as sacred, animate, and full of other-than-human persons with whom they maintained reciprocal relationships.

This groundbreaking volume is essential for anyone interested in environmental ethics, religious studies, anthropology, or understanding alternative ways of relating to the natural world. It offers profound insights into how we might rediscover more respectful, sustainable relationships with our environment by learning from ancient wisdom traditions that saw the world as a community of beings rather than a collection of resources.

## Core Insights

### The Nature/Culture Divide is a Western Construct
The book argues that the separation between "nature" and "culture" is a uniquely Western invention that developed after the Middle Ages. For most ancient and non-Western cultures, such a distinction would have been incomprehensible.

> "The determination of nature as pure materiality—absent gods, incarnate spirits, or any such non-human persons—is a unique Western invention."
> _Original: "The determination of nature as pure materiality—absent gods, incarnate spirits, or any such non-human persons—is a unique Western invention."_

**Quick Take**: Our modern environmental crisis stems partly from this artificial separation that allows us to treat nature as dead matter to be exploited rather than as living community to be respected.

### New Animism: A Relational Worldview
The book introduces "new animism" not as primitive belief but as sophisticated understanding of the world as full of persons—only some of whom are human. This worldview recognizes agency, consciousness, and relationality throughout the natural world.

> "Animists recognize that the world is full of persons, only some of whom are human, and that life is always lived in relationship with others."
> _Original: "Animists recognize that the world is full of persons, only some of whom are human, and that life is always lived in relationship with others."_

**Quick Take**: Animism is actually about learning to act respectfully toward all beings, understanding ourselves as part of a larger community of life rather than as separate dominators.

### Material Religion: How Belief Becomes Physical
The volume advocates for a "material turn" in religious studies, recognizing that religion happens through physical objects, rituals, places, and practices, not just through abstract beliefs.

> "Religion is done and co-created by a complex and dynamic network of agents, be they bodies, rituals, places, objects, images, stones, rivers, seas, trees, sounds, tastes, smells, as much as by texts, minds, beliefs, spirits."
> _Original: "Religion is done and co-created by a complex and dynamic network of agents, be they bodies, rituals, places, objects, images, stones, rivers, seas, trees, sounds, tastes, smells, as much as by texts, minds, beliefs, spirits."_

**Quick Take**: Sacredness isn't just in our minds—it's embodied in our relationships with physical places, objects, and practices that connect us to the larger community of life.

### Ancient Wisdom for Modern Environmental Ethics
The book reveals how ancient Biblical and other religious traditions contained sophisticated ecological understandings where all creatures had responsibilities and rights within the community.

> "Every creature depends on every other creature to fulfil their obligations. When one creature fails, everyone suffers."
> _Original: "Every creature depends on every other creature to fulfil their obligations. When one creature fails, everyone suffers."_

**Quick Take**: Ancient religious traditions often understood environmental ethics better than modern ones, recognizing that health is communal and includes all beings in the ecosystem.

### Objects as Active Participants
The research shows how ancient peoples understood objects—not as inanimate things but as active participants in social and spiritual life, capable of mediating relationships and exercising agency.

> "The umiaq was a symbolically powerful and hybrid assemblage and 'object-being', which acted as active mediator between men and women and among humans, plants and animals."
> _Original: "The umiaq was a symbolically powerful and hybrid assemblage and 'object-being', which acted as active mediator between men and women and among humans, plants and animals."_

**Quick Take**: When we see objects as mere resources, we miss their role as active participants in the web of relationships that sustains life and meaning.

- "What emerges in this rich volume is a multi-layered and multi-dimensional portrayal of different specific relationships between humans and their surrounding world in ancient times. Goddesses, trees and nymphs, whales and watercrafts, water and ice, livers and objects, land and mountains, deers and birds, women and men all partook to a relational cosmos perceived as a broader-than-human community."

## Action Items

- **Recognize personhood in nature**: Practice seeing animals, plants, landscapes, and even objects as beings with whom we are in relationship rather than as mere resources
- **Question the nature/culture divide**: Notice how you unconsciously separate "human" from "natural" and work to heal this artificial split in your thinking
- **Engage physically with the world**: Remember that sacred relationships are built through physical practices, rituals, and care for places and objects
- **Learn from ancient wisdom**: Study indigenous and traditional understandings of human-environment relationships as sophisticated alternatives to modern exploitation
- **Practice reciprocity**: Consider not just what you can take from nature but what you can give back to maintain healthy relationships

## Questions to Consider

- How would your relationship with the natural world change if you truly saw it as a community of persons rather than as resources?
- What rituals or practices in your life already acknowledge the sacredness of nature, and how could these be deepened?
- How might our environmental policies and business practices change if we recognized the rights and responsibilities of non-human beings?
- What would it mean to understand objects as active participants rather than passive tools in our lives?
- How can we recover ancient wisdom about relational living while still benefiting from modern knowledge and technology?

## Conclusion
"Sacred Nature" is more than an academic study—it's a radical reimagining of how humans can relate to the world around us. By revealing how ancient cultures understood nature as a living, sacred community of persons, the book challenges our modern assumptions and offers a pathway toward more sustainable, respectful relationships with our environment.

The biggest reason to read this book is its potential to transform how you see the world. In an era of environmental crisis, understanding that the nature/culture divide is a recent, Western invention—and that many cultures throughout history have lived according to more integrated, relational worldviews—offers both hope and practical wisdom for creating a better future.

This book is worth your time because it doesn't just criticize modern problems but offers concrete alternatives drawn from ancient wisdom. It shows that different ways of being in relationship with the natural world are not only possible but have been successfully practiced for millennia across diverse cultures. Whether you're interested in environmental ethics, religious studies, or simply want to understand how we might live more harmoniously on Earth, "Sacred Nature" provides essential insights for reimagining our place within the community of life.
