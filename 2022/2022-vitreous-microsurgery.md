# Vitreous Microsurgery
**Authors**: Steve Charles, MD, Stephen Huddleston, MD | **Year**: 2022

## Summary

"Vitreous Microsurgery" (6th Edition) represents the definitive guide to modern vitreoretinal surgery, emphasizing **25/27-gauge microincisional techniques** and **3D digital visualization (heads-up surgery)**. This comprehensive textbook transcends traditional academic literature by focusing on detailed surgical technique and technology rather than statistical outcomes.

This book is essential for **ophthalmic surgeons**, **vitreoretinal fellows**, and **operating room staff** who want to master the latest surgical technologies and techniques. Readers will gain mastery of microincisional vitrectomy, 3D visualization setup, and the systematic approach to complex retinal surgeries that have made Charles and Huddleston pioneers in the field.

## Core Surgical Framework

### The 25/27-Gauge Revolution
Modern vitreoretinal surgery has shifted to **microincisional techniques** as the global standard of care. The authors use 25/27-gauge sutureless technique for ALL cases, citing advantages including minimal discomfort, low complication rates, and the ability to operate on macular disorders with good preoperative vision.

> "Microincisional 25/27-gauge vitrectomy continues to grow in adoption on a worldwide basis."

**Quick Take**: Start learning with 25-gauge systems and progress to 27-gauge for macular cases. Never use larger gauge instruments unless absolutely necessary.

### 3D Visualization Mastery (Heads-Up Surgery)
The paradigm shift to 3D digital visualization requires specific setup optimization: **55-inch OLED display positioned 4 feet from surgeon**, display filled vertically, and precise focus progression from cannula to retinal surface. Use lower light levels (15-20% for vitrectomy, 1-5% for macular surgery) compared to traditional microscopy.

**Setup Framework**:
- Display position: 4 feet from surgeon eye level
- Screen fill: Vertical maximization
- Light management: Reduced levels vs. microscope
- Focus progression: Systematic from instrument to retina

**Quick Take**: 3D visualization reduces surgeon fatigue and enables team education, but requires specific setup optimization and adaptation period.

### Mechanical Problem-Solving Philosophy
Vitrectomy should be thought of as a **mechanical approach to anatomical problems caused by vitreoretinal traction**. This surgical philosophy emphasizes direct mechanical solutions rather than medical management, recognizing that vitrectomy has no prophylactic benefit in preventing proliferative vitreoretinopathy (PVR).

**Core Principle**: Address the mechanical traction directly using precise techniques rather than expecting biological solutions.

**Quick Take**: Think mechanically, not biologically. Every surgical decision should address specific traction forces causing anatomical problems.

## Essential Surgical Techniques

### High-Speed Vitrectomy Protocol
Modern vitrectomy requires **high cutting rates** to reduce pulsatile vitreoretinal traction. The combination of high cutting speeds with proportional aspiration prevents suction-induced trauma while maintaining efficient vitreous removal.

**Implementation Steps**:
1. Set cutting rate to maximum (7,500+ cuts/min)
2. Use proportional aspiration rather than fixed vacuum
3. Maintain infusion pressure to prevent collapse
4. Work from posterior to anterior

**Quick Win**: Increase cutting rate before increasing vacuum for safer vitreous removal.

### Inside-Out Membrane Peeling
The **inside-out forceps technique** is superior to pic forceps for epiretinal membrane removal. This approach provides better membrane grip and reduces retinal trauma compared to other methods.

**Technique Hierarchy**:
1. **Inside-out forceps** (preferred)
2. Pics and forceps combination
3. Forceps with blade under membrane

**Quick Win**: Practice inside-out forceps technique on simulation platforms before human cases.

### Endo-Drainage Mastery
Use **27-gauge backflush cannula** for controlled subretinal fluid drainage. This technique provides superior control compared to passive drainage methods and reduces the risk of retinal incarceration.

**Key Steps**:
1. Identify drainage site in peripheral retina
2. Create retinotomy with 25-gauge blade
3. Insert 27-gauge cannula gently
4. Control drainage with foot pedal modulation

**Quick Win**: Practice on laboratory eyes to understand fluid dynamics before clinical use.

## Critical Safety Rules

### The "NEVER" List
These absolute rules prevent catastrophic complications:

**NEVER** use phacoemulsifier for vitrectomy - phaco probes liquefy hyaluronan but don't cut collagen fibers
**NEVER** use ultrasonic fragmenter for vitrectomy - causes uncontrolled tissue damage
**NEVER** perform vitrectomy on no light perception eyes (except infection/cosmetic cases)
**NEVER** use cellulose sponge for vitrectomy - causes excessive vitreoretinal traction
**NEVER** create posterior vitreous detachment in limited peripheral view situations

> "Optimal visualization is essential to safe vitrectomy. While it is obviously desirable to preserve the corneal epithelium and the lens, neither one is as important as the ability to perform a safe vitrectomy."

**Quick Take**: Safety first, then efficiency. These rules exist because complications can be devastating.

### Problem-Oriented Patient Evaluation
Use a **problem-oriented approach** emphasizing specific factors with high impact on decision-making rather than "routine" examinations. The goal is avoiding bilateral or irreversible visual disability rather than seeking easy cases.

**Evaluation Framework**:
- Visual function testing with current refraction
- Near vision assessment (essential for myopia evaluation)
- Retinal break detection for surgical planning
- Systemic disease impact assessment

**Quick Win**: Implement standardized preoperative evaluation templates that focus on surgical decision factors.

## Technology Integration Framework

### Intraoperative OCT Integration
Real-time OCT guidance enables assessment of subretinal maneuvers and improves outcomes in epiretinal membrane procedures. The technology provides dynamic feedback during surgical instrument manipulation.

**Best Applications**:
- Membrane surgery confirmation
- Subretinal instrument positioning
- Macular hole edge assessment
- Retinal detachment evaluation

**Quick Win**: Start with membrane surgery cases where OCT provides the most value, then expand to other applications.

### Endoscopy Applications
Endoscopy is primarily valuable for **opaque media situations** and far peripheral visualization. When combined with 3D visualization using picture-in-picture display, it provides adequate resolution for peripheral tasks but shouldn't be used for macular surgery due to insufficient resolution and lack of stereopsis.

**Optimal Setup**:
- Picture-in-picture display with NGENUITY 3D system
- Limited to opaque media cases
- Peripheral tasks only
- Never for macular surgery

**Quick Win**: Reserve endoscopy for specific indications where standard visualization fails.

## Self-Education System

### Laboratory Practice Mandate
**Never begin vitreous surgery or new techniques on human patients without sufficient practice**. The great complexity of vitreoretinal surgery requires honest assessment of personal capabilities before clinical application.

**Essential Requirements**:
- Stereopsis mandatory for vitrectomy
- Color vision essential for neovascularization detection
- Appropriate temperament: calm but rapid and efficient
- Economic reality: procedures done frequently enough to maintain skill

**Quick Win**: Schedule regular laboratory practice sessions, especially before adopting new techniques.

### Outcomes-Driven Improvement
The **collection of preoperative, operative, and postoperative information** is essential for self-assessment. Implement quarterly outcomes analysis with disease-specific benchmarking and complete operative documentation.

**Data Collection Requirements**:
- Preoperative visual function and anatomy
- Intraoperative complications and techniques
- Postoperative outcomes and complications
- Patient satisfaction metrics

**Quick Win**: Start with simple outcome tracking and gradually expand to comprehensive data collection.

## Patient Management Excellence

### Financial Advocacy Responsibility
The **surgeon must take personal responsibility** for obtaining financial support for economically disadvantaged patients. This goes beyond medical care to include socioeconomic advocacy.

**Communication Excellence**:
- Use percentage success rates instead of qualitative terms
- Discuss complications and visual outcomes specifically
- Consider socioeconomic factors in surgical decisions
- Provide realistic expectations based on disease severity

**Quick Win**: Develop standardized communication templates that convey realistic success rates and potential complications.

### Scheduling Priority System
**Waiting lists are highly inappropriate** for patients with significant visual problems. Implement priority scheduling based on visual function and disease progression risk.

**Priority Framework**:
- Macular-involving retinal detachments: immediate
- Progressive diabetic traction: urgent
- Stable macular disorders: prompt but flexible
- Elective procedures: scheduled appropriately

**Quick Win**: Implement triage system that prioritizes based on visual threat rather than appointment availability.
