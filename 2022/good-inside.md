## Building Connection and Addressing Behaviors

In this part of the book, the focus is on strategies to build connection with children and address challenging behaviors, particularly for deeply feeling kids (DFKs). The author emphasizes the importance of understanding and empathizing with DFKs, acknowledging that they experience emotions more intensely and can become easily overwhelmed. It is crucial for parents to shift from blame to curiosity, seeking to understand their child's underlying needs and fears.

The first strategy discussed is containment. When a DFK is in a state of dysregulation, parents should prioritize keeping the child safe by removing them from the situation and providing a smaller, calm space. Even if the child resists being moved, it is important for the parent to assert their role as a sturdy leader who can handle the child's overwhelming emotions. This helps the child see that their feelings do not overpower their parent and that they are not alone.

The author also emphasizes viewing the DFK as a "good kid having a hard time." By recognizing the child's inherent goodness and acknowledging that their challenging behaviors stem from their struggle with intense emotions, parents can maintain a compassionate perspective. This mindset encourages parents to offer support and reassurance, reassuring the child of their love and commitment.

Presence is highlighted as a powerful tool in building connection. The parent's calm and loving presence communicates to the DFK that they are not too much or overwhelming, fostering a sense of safety and acceptance. Even without words, the parent's physical presence provides a powerful message of love and support.

For DFKs who are resistant to discussing their feelings directly, the Thumbs Up/Down/to the Side game is introduced. This playful approach allows the child to express their agreement, disagreement, or mixed feelings about statements related to emotions without direct confrontation. By creating a safe space for expression, parents can gradually increase the child's tolerance for emotions and vulnerability.

This part concludes with a case example of Angie and her daughter Maura. Angie practices containment when Maura becomes dysregulated, reassuring her that she is a good kid having a hard time and that she is loved. Angie also utilizes the Thumbs Up/Down/to the Side game, which provides insight into Maura's struggles and helps Angie better understand her behavior.

Overall, the strategies presented in this part emphasize the importance of building a secure connection with DFKs, recognizing their intense emotions, and providing a safe and supportive environment for their emotional growth and development. By adopting these approaches, parents can help their children regulate their emotions, find calm, and develop healthy relationships with others.
