## Wardenclyffe

In 1901, James Galbraith, an agent of Nikola Tesla, embarked on a mission to establish a receiving station in Lisbon, communicating with a Tesla transmitter on the New Jersey coast. This marked the first practical application of Tesla's long-distance wireless system. Prior to this, Tesla had constructed a wireless laboratory in Colorado Springs in 1899, where he conducted various experiments, including creating ball lightning and thunderbolts. However, these experiments posed dangers, leading to fires and explosions. Tesla claimed to have excited incandescent lamps at considerable distances from the laboratory during this time.

Tesla's most ambitious project was the construction of a wireless transmitter at Wardenclyffe in Long Island. His vision was to transmit energy and messages wirelessly to any point on the globe. The project, often referred to as the "Radio City," had grand plans, but financial constraints limited the tower's construction to 187 feet, along with underground tunnels and ground connections. Tesla's idea was to use the Earth as a return conductor for wireless communication, drawing inspiration from the discoveries of Mahlon Loomis and William Preece.

In his wireless experiments, Tesla utilized a coherer, a device developed by Ã‰douard Branly and improved by Oliver Lodge, for detecting wireless impulses. Tesla further enhanced the coherer using metal powders from Alexander Popov and Dr. H. Rupp to increase its sensitivity, allowing him to track thunderstorms at long distances. The underground portion of the Wardenclyffe tower revealed a network of tunnels and passages, reminiscent of a wooden structure found in an ocean steamer's companionway.

Tesla proposed a revolutionary transmission system, involving the suppression of electromagnetic radiations, boosting the ground connection, and controlling wavelengths to achieve precise energy pinpointing with minimal losses. His goal was to transmit a guided surface wave by conduction to power airplanes and other devices. The transmission would be selective, based on tuned wavelengths, and Tesla envisioned a network of resonant towers around the planet for global wireless transmission.

The Wardenclyffe tower consisted of three coils: a thick primary/secondary coil, a thin secondary/primary coil, and an extra coil for modulating frequencies. To power this system, Tesla required a power source, a ground connection with deep metal shafts, liquid air for oscillation magnification, and an elevated terminal for storing charge. By altering the wavelength length, Tesla aimed to precisely pinpoint the transmitted energy to specific locations.

J. Pierpont Morgan, a prominent figure in the financial world, played a pivotal role in Tesla's venture at Wardenclyffe. Morgan had a stake in General Electric and agreed to back Tesla's wireless power transmission system. However, Tesla's portrayal of the venture as philanthropic was not entirely accurate, as it was primarily a business deal, and Morgan had vested interests in Tesla's inventions. Tesla's decision to construct a larger tower without Morgan's consent led to the financier's withdrawal of support, ultimately leading to the project's failure. Tesla faced significant hardships during this period, leading to a nervous breakdown, but he maintained a public persona in his pursuit of other investors.

Tesla's experiments at Wardenclyffe and his wireless transmission ideas were groundbreaking but faced significant challenges, including financial constraints and the withdrawal of support from influential figures like J. Pierpont Morgan. Despite the setbacks, Tesla's contributions to the field of wireless communication laid the groundwork for future advancements in global connectivity.

## Wireless

Nikola Tesla's visionary ideas were often ahead of their time. In 1898, he proposed the construction of an automobile carriage capable of performing various operations involving judgment. Unfortunately, the idea was considered unrealistic at that time.

Tesla's interest in telautomatics, remote control, and remote-controlled robotics is evident in his patent titled "Methods of Controlling Automata at a Distance." He envisioned using this technology for remote control of instruments of war like torpedoes and aerial bombardment, but he also believed it could be applied to various remote-controlled devices. His telautomaton demonstrated the principles of selective tuning and binary code, making it an early radio-guidance system.

Beyond remote control, Tesla dreamed of creating an automaton with its own intelligence, paving the way for artificial intelligence. He believed that such inventions could make war obsolete, as machines could fight instead of humans, leading to a more peaceful world.

Tesla formed a partnership with John Hays Hammond Jr., and they worked on turbines and torpedoes. However, the relationship faced challenges due to funding and restricted wireless patents. Hammond's military think tank, focused on radio-dynamics, developed equipment like the audion radio tube, autopilot, and radio-guidance systems.

In 1904, Arthur Korn successfully transmitted a photograph along transmission lines using Tesla currents. Tesla extended his telephotography system, even envisioning the transmission of thought images and a typewriter operated by the human voice. In modern times, a graduate student at MIT's Media Lab, Arnav Kapur, achieved a similar idea with his device called AlterEgo, which allows communication with computers and search engines through thought.

Despite his pioneering work in wireless telegraphy, Tesla faced challenges in receiving proper recognition. Marconi, his competitor, gained significant recognition and success, and the ongoing World War I further complicated the legal battle between them. The war powers act suspended patent litigation, leaving the issue unresolved.

Tesla's financial troubles escalated, and he attempted to raise funds through inventions like the tachometer and bladeless turbines. He also sought to market his wireless technology as a defensive weapon during the war.

In 1917, Tesla was awarded the Edison Medal, but he had mixed feelings about it due to past conflicts with Edison. Tesla believed that many of his creations were more significant than a Nobel Prize, and the Swedish Academy's prejudice might have played a role in their failure to honor him.

Tesla's association with German companies during the war, including those with ties to German spies, raised suspicions. His Wardenclyffe tower faced demolition, and his vision of wireless power transmission seemed to be on hold.

In the 1920s, Tesla worked on top-secret devices, including an electric car powered by a distant source. He proposed using steam-generated power to drive a dynamo and then an induction motor for increased efficiency. Tesla remained interested in wireless power transmission, similar to his Wardenclyffe project.

The story of a wireless-powered Pierce-Arrow car demonstrated to Heinz Jerbens in 1930 has inconsistencies and lacks concrete evidence. Doubts remain about the validity of this tale.

Throughout his life, Tesla's ideas and inventions were often groundbreaking, shaping the future of technology in ways that continue to impact society today.

## Death Ray

Nikola Tesla had a deep emotional connection with a pure white pigeon with light grey tipped wings, which he called the "White Pigeon." He considered the pigeon his companion and loved her dearly, believing that she understood him, and he understood her. Tesla's emotional bond with the White Pigeon was so strong that he compared it to the love between a man and a woman. He cared for her when she was ill and considered her the joy and purpose of his life. His story of this connection was shared with his biographer and Herald Tribune reporter John O'Neill, revealing Tesla's need for love despite his ambition to become a "self-made superman."

During World War II, Tesla's inventions, particularly the particle beam weapon, became subjects of interest for military and government officials. He was pursued for information about his inventions, and there were allegations of his involvement with foreign governments like Russia and attempts to sell his weapon designs.

Tesla's death in January 1943 led to investigations into his effects and inventions, with various agencies interested in his research papers and devices. His inventions, especially the particle beam weapon, were considered important for military applications, and there were claims that he offered them to the United States government during the war.

Throughout the last ten years of his life, Tesla lived in the Hotel New Yorker, where he was considered eccentric and mentally deranged by some hotel managers. The hotel had a unique tunnel to its own subway stop, which could have allowed Tesla discreet access to other locations, fueling speculations about his involvement with the government and the military during World War II.

Tesla's claims about the potential of his death ray and its military applications date back to World War I, but he kept much of his research secret. He saw the death ray weapon as a last attempt to gain support for his Wardenclyffe broadcasting station and potentially save it from financial ruin.

Tesla's association with the government and military remains enigmatic, with some information still classified or unavailable in official records. The FBI had considerable information about Nikola Tesla in their files after his death, but much less from before that time. He became a person of interest in the Oval Office, and President Roosevelt requested more information on him.

Government official Ralph Bergstresser had direct meetings with Tesla before his death and later worked to preserve Tesla's experiments and inventions by creating a memorial foundation. However, there were concerns about foreign agents obtaining Tesla's papers and inventions.

Tesla's ties to Nazi sympathizers and individuals connected to the Nazi regime, like George Sylvester Viereck, raised further suspicions. The FBI surveilled Viereck and others with suspected ties to Nazi activities, given the subversive articles they wrote.

MIT professor John G. Trump analyzed Nikola Tesla's papers and possessions after his death and concluded that there were no scientific notes, unrevealed methods, or devices of significant value or military hazard among Tesla's belongings.

Tesla's work on wireless inventions, including radar, received mixed responses from the military during both World Wars. Some factions took his ideas more seriously than others.

Tesla also had interactions with the British War Office and the Yugoslavian government, offering his particle beam weapon to protect England from potential invasion. However, bureaucratic challenges, financial constraints, and geopolitical events affected the reception of his proposals.

In modern times, the realization of some of Tesla's ideas can be seen in today's rail gun and laser weapon systems used in the military.

## God Particle

Nikola Tesla's contributions to physics and our understanding of the universe were vast and complex. Tesla's ideas about the ether, a hypothetical substance once thought to pervade space, were deeply intertwined with his understanding of the universe. Newton used the ether to explain gravity, while Faraday saw it as a material force for electromagnetic energy. However, the Michelson-Morley experiment's failure to detect the ether led to the theory of relativity, which replaced the concept of ether in modern physics.

In his experiments, Tesla explored high-frequency phenomena and wireless communication, often using the ether as a medium for transmitting energy wirelessly. He believed in the existence of this mysterious substance, and it was central to his theories and inventions.

Tesla's vision also encompassed the integration of relativity and quantum mechanics, a challenge taken up by physicists like Dirac, who introduced hypernumbers to resolve the conflict between the two theories.

While Tesla's ideas were groundbreaking, some of them deviated from mainstream physics, causing disagreements with other scientists. He disagreed with Einstein's theory of relativity and proposed his own dynamic theory of gravity, which suggested that matter absorbed ether from the environment, generating gravity.

Despite Einstein's abandonment of the ether in his theories, Tesla's ideas indicated that some form of medium must exist between celestial bodies for light to propagate. He believed in the existence of the ether and criticized Einstein's theory of relativity.

Tesla's theories extended to the structure of matter, and he proposed a mental picture of atoms and molecules spinning and moving like celestial bodies, carrying static charges. These ideas foreshadowed future discoveries in physics.
