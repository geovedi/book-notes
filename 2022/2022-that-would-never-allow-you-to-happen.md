**Original Title**: Dat zou jij nooit toelaten | **Author**: Tessel ten Zweege | **Year**: 2022 

## Summary

This raw, unflinching memoir chronicles the author's journey through a toxic and destructive relationship that shattered her understanding of love and nearly destroyed her sense of self. Tessel ten Zweege, a young feminist writer and student, meticulously documents how she found herself trapped in an abusive relationship with Luis, despite her education, awareness, and strong feminist beliefs. The book serves as both a personal testimony and a broader examination of intimate partner violence, challenging stereotypes and shedding light on the systematic nature of abuse in our society.

The narrative unfolds in three powerful sections: the initial meeting and red flags, the escalating abuse and psychological deterioration, and finally the difficult journey of recovery and self-reclamation. Through her story, ten Zweege reveals how abuse can happen to anyone, regardless of education, feminist awareness, or strength of character, while also examining the societal structures that enable intimate partner violence to persist.

This book is essential reading for anyone seeking to understand the complex dynamics of abusive relationships, the psychological mechanisms of control, and the challenging path to healing and self-recovery. It's particularly valuable for those who want to recognize warning signs in their own relationships or support others experiencing abuse.

## Core Insights

### The Illusion of Immunity

The author's feminist education and awareness created a false sense of security that she was "too smart" to fall into an abusive relationship. This dangerous misconception prevented her from recognizing the warning signs early on. Her story demonstrates that abuse can affect anyone, regardless of education, strength, or awareness.

> "I couldn't believe that I, feminist writer, student and all-around recalcitrant lady, would let myself be treated like this."
> _Original: "Ik kon niet geloven dat ík, feministisch schrijfster, student en allround recalcitrante dame, me zó liet behandelen."_

**Quick Take**: Education about abuse doesn't equal immunity from abuse – awareness must be paired with vigilance and self-compassion.

### The Gradual Nature of Control

Abuse rarely begins with obvious violence. Instead, it starts with small incidents that seem manageable or explainable, gradually escalating over time. The "sliding scale" of abuse makes it difficult to pinpoint when things crossed from problematic to dangerous.

> "It's a sliding scale: where does a lashing out when your partner had a stressful day end, and where does verbal abuse begin?"
> _Original: "Het is immers een glijdende schaal: waar eindigt een afreagerende sneer als je partner een stressvolle dag heeft gehad, en waar begint verbaal geweld?"_

**Quick Take**: Trust your gut feeling about seemingly "small" incidents – they often signal larger patterns of control.

### Media's Role in Shaping Relationship Expectations

The author reveals how romantic comedies and popular media taught her that passionate relationships equals constant conflict, jealousy, and drama. Films like *The Notebook* and *Bridget Jones's Diary* normalized controlling behaviors as romantic gestures.

> "We sat with tears in our eyes sipping our Jillz. 'Goals,' she sighed."
> _Original: "Met tranen op onze wangen zaten Fien en ik aan onze Jillz te lurken. 'Goals,' zuchtte ze."_

**Quick Take**: Examine your relationship expectations – many "romantic" tropes in media actually depict controlling or abusive behaviors.

### The Isolation Strategy

Abusers systematically isolate their victims from support networks, making it harder to leave or seek help. This happens through gradual alienation from friends and family, combined with psychological manipulation that makes the victim feel responsible for the abuser's behavior.

> "I realized I wasn't just dealing with my own confused mind, I had to translate all this to the outside world. I had been lying about everything lately."
> _Original: "Ik besef nog niet echt dat ik weer veilig ben in dit bed... Ik realiseer me dat ik niet alleen met mijn eigen warrige hoofd moet dealen, ik moet dit alles ook nog naar de buitenwereld gaan vertalen. Ik heb de boel bij elkaar gelogen de afgelopen tijd."_

**Quick Take**: Maintaining connections with friends and family is crucial – isolation is a key tool of abusers.

### Systemic Nature of Partner Violence

The book contextualizes intimate partner violence within broader societal structures, particularly patriarchy. In the Netherlands, 12% of the population experiences abuse from intimate partners, and a woman is murdered by her partner every 10 days. These statistics reflect systemic, not individual, problems.

> "We live in a society where masculinity dominates, the towering statistics on partner violence are a symptom of that."
> _Original: "We leven in een samenleving wherein mannelijkheid domineert, de torenhoge statistieken over partnergeweld zijn daarvan een symptoom."_

**Quick Take**: Individual abuse cases connect to larger societal patterns – addressing them requires both personal and systemic change.

## Conclusion

**Is this worth your time?** Absolutely. This book is a crucial contribution to understanding how intimate partner violence happens and why it's so difficult to leave. Ten Zweege's honest, detailed account provides invaluable insights into the psychological mechanisms of abuse while challenging common stereotypes about who can become a victim.

**The biggest reason to read this book** is its powerful combination of personal vulnerability and sharp social analysis. The author doesn't just share her story – she connects it to broader patterns of intimate partner violence, examining how media, socialization, and systemic inequality create conditions where abuse can flourish. Her feminist perspective adds crucial depth to understanding how even educated, aware women can find themselves trapped in abusive relationships.

The book's greatest strength is its unflinching honesty about the author's own confusion, denial, and gradual loss of self. This willingness to admit her own vulnerability makes the narrative incredibly powerful and relatable. She shows that the real danger isn't being "too stupid" to recognize abuse, but being too human to admit when something you desperately want to be love is actually poison.

For anyone who has experienced abuse, loved someone who has, or simply wants to understand this widespread social problem, this book provides both essential insights and hope for healing and change.
