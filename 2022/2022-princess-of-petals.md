## Summary

Princess of Petals is a fantasy academy romance inspired by the Beauty and the Beast fairy tale, part of the Grimm Academy series. The story follows Astrid, a merchant's daughter who has lived under the shadow of a prophecy since childhood - that she'll be trapped in an endless forest hunted by a beast after being given a rose. When she receives an unexpected invitation to the prestigious Grimm Academy, her parents send her with the expectation that she'll secure a noble marriage to advance their social status.

At the academy, Astrid forms deep friendships with Princess Cordelia (a "homeless princess" who will never inherit) and Princess Elisa. She also meets Conan, a charming scholarship student who shares her prophecy anxieties. As Astrid navigates academy life, she faces the looming threat of her prophecy while being torn between her parents' expectations and her growing feelings for Conan. When the Bellpoint Castle competition to find an heir offers a potential solution, Astrid sees a chance to win her freedom and choose her own path.

This sweet fantasy romance will appeal to readers who enjoy fairy tale retellings, academy settings, and stories about finding true family while breaking free from parental expectations.

### The Prophecy That Haunts

Astrid's core conflict revolves around a prophecy that foretells her doom: receiving a rose will trigger her entrapment in an endless forest, hunted by a beast. This prophecy has hung over her since childhood, creating deep anxiety and influencing every decision she makes. The rose prophecy cleverly adapts the Beauty and the Beast fairy tale element where the father steals a rose from the beast's garden, transforming it into a personal curse for the heroine.

> "Nobody has given me a rose," I assure them both.
>
> "It's about your prophecy."

The prophecy serves as both literal threat and metaphor for the constraints placed upon women in their society - the expectation that they'll marry for advantage rather than love, and the limited control they have over their own futures.

### Found Family at Grimm Academy

The academy setting provides Astrid with her first experience of genuine friendship and acceptance. Cordelia, despite her royal title, understands feeling displaced - she's a princess without a kingdom who will never inherit. Elisa, another princess, offers quiet wisdom about choosing one's own path. These relationships become Astrid's true family, contrasting sharply with her demanding, transactional relationships with her biological family.

> "Coming to Grimm Academy hasn't just rid me of the prophecy that's haunted a good part of my life, it's found me a true family that I know will last a lifetime."

The found family theme demonstrates how chosen relationships can be more meaningful than those of blood, and how supportive friendships provide the strength to break harmful family patterns.

### Love vs. Social Expectation

The central romantic tension between Astrid and Conan develops against their shared status as outsiders at the academy. Both are scholarship students from non-noble backgrounds, creating immediate connection. Their romance represents the possibility of choosing love over social advancement, challenging her parents' expectation that she marry a noble for their benefit.

> "Conan finally asked me if I'd officially court him, so it was worth it."

The resolution finds Astrid choosing authentic connection with Conan despite potential family disapproval, embodying the book's message that personal happiness matters more than social climbing.
