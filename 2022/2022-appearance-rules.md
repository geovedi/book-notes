## Summary
Roderick Veelo's "De schijn regeert" (Appearance Rules) is a provocative collection of columns that exposes how image management, reputation engineering, and narrative control have replaced factual reality in modern public discourse. The book argues that journalists, corporations, politicians, and activists have become increasingly preoccupied with managing perceptions rather than reporting truth, creating a dangerous gap between appearance and reality. Veelo, a seasoned journalist, demonstrates how this obsession with "beeldvorming" (image formation) has corrupted journalism, where storytelling now trumps facts, and where the media actively constructs narratives rather than reports reality.

The book is essential reading for anyone concerned about the erosion of factual journalism and the rise of manipulative storytelling in public life. Readers will gain a critical framework for identifying when they're being manipulated by carefully crafted narratives and will learn to distinguish between genuine reporting and propaganda disguised as journalism.

## Core Insights

### Image Management Has Replaced Reality
Veelo argues that modern institutions have become obsessed with controlling perceptions rather than dealing with actual problems. The book shows how corporations like Unilever present themselves as socially responsible while ignoring human rights violations in countries where they operate, and how Starbucks implemented mandatory anti-racism training primarily for public relations purposes rather than genuine change.

> "The images we choose have an influence on image formation."
> _Original: "De beelden die we kiezen hebben invloed op de beeldvorming."_

**Quick Take**: Modern institutions invest more energy in managing appearances than solving real problems, creating a dangerous disconnect between projected image and actual behavior.

### Journalism Has Abandoned Its Mission
The book's most damning criticism targets journalism itself. Veelo documents how reporters have become activists who prioritize narrative control over factual reporting. He analyzes several cases where major news organizations constructed false stories to serve predetermined narratives, such as the Nick Sandman case where media outlets falsely portrayed a teenager as racist and had to pay historic defamation settlements.

> "Journalists should check power in what they do and whether truth is spoken. The only real weapon is the facts and nothing but the facts when appearance rules."
> _Original: "Journalisten controleren de macht in wat zij uitvoert en of de waarheid gesproken wordt. Het enige echte wapen zijn de feiten en niets dan de feiten wanneer de schijn regeert."_

**Quick Take**: When journalists become storytellers rather than fact-finders, they betray their core mission and become propagandists rather than watchdogs.

### The Dictatorship of Uncompromising Minorities
Veelo borrows from Nassim Nicholas Taleb to explain how small, vocal, and uncompromising groups can impose their will on the silent majority. He uses the powerful example of a vegan daughter converting her entire family and then their neighborhood through social pressure and the desire to avoid conflict.

> "The dictatorship of the uncompromising minority... a process of re-normalization: replacing the norm of the majority with the norm of a minority."
> _Original: "De dictatuur van de onverzoenlijke minderheid... een proces van her-normalisering: het normaal van de meerderheid vervangen door het normaal van een minderheid."_

**Quick Take**: Social pressure and conflict avoidance enable small, committed minorities to impose their values on the majority, who surrender their norms to maintain peace.

### Corporate Hypocrisy and Exploitation
The book exposes how companies use social causes as marketing tools while continuing harmful practices. Veelo shows how employers advocate for immigration primarily to suppress wages, how corporations champion environmental causes while engaging in destructive practices, and how social responsibility has become another marketing strategy rather than a genuine commitment.

> "Employers are always for more immigration. Because the more workers available, the cheaper they are. Employers love competition, especially in the labor market."
> _Original: "Werkgevers zijn altijd voor meer immigratie. Want hoe meer arbeidskrachten voorhanden, hoe goedkoper ze zijn. Werkgevers zijn dol op concurrentie, vooral op de arbeidsmarkt."_

**Quick Take**: Corporate social responsibility is often a strategic tool for reputation management rather than genuine ethical commitment.

### Political Theater Versus Governance
Veelo documents how modern politics has become more about performance than governance. Politicians prioritize image management over problem-solving, leading to reactive rather than proactive governance. The book shows how Dutch politicians struggle to address organized crime, immigration, and other pressing issues because they're more concerned with appearances than effective solutions.

> "If governing is looking ahead, is the Netherlands actually being governed?"
> _Original: "Als regeren vooruitzien is, wordt Nederland dan wel geregeerd?"_

**Quick Take**: Modern politics has become theater where appearance management trumps effective governance, leaving societies vulnerable to real threats.

## Conclusion

"De schijn regeert" is a powerful and necessary critique of modern media and public discourse. Veelo's analysis is particularly valuable because it comes from within the journalism profession, making his criticism both credible and troubling. The book demonstrates how the obsession with managing appearances has created a dangerous disconnect between perception and reality across all major institutions.

This is absolutely worth your time if you're concerned about media manipulation, corporate hypocrisy, or political theater. The biggest reason to read it is that it provides the intellectual tools to identify when you're being manipulated by narratives rather than informed by facts. In an era where image management increasingly trumps reality, Veelo's call to return to "nothing but the facts" journalism is not just refreshing—it's essential for the preservation of democratic discourse and informed citizenship.
