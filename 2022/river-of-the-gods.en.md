## Some Gallant Heart
### A Blaze of Light
Richard Francis Burton, a British army lieutenant, conceived an audacious plan for an expedition that would take him to the forbidden city of Mecca, where non-Muslims were strictly forbidden. His goal was to explore and understand the "Moslem inner life" and sacred sites, a task filled with immense risk and danger. To achieve this, Burton hatched a daring scheme: he would disguise himself as Shaykh Abdullah, an Afghan-born Indian doctor, and befriend fellow pilgrims on the Hajj.

Supported and financed by the Royal Geographical Society, which was impressed by his qualifications and ambition, Burton embarked on this extraordinary journey. His unconventional upbringing, marked by a nomadic childhood, left him feeling disconnected from England and somewhat distrusted by Victorian society. However, his remarkable linguistic abilities, encompassing over twenty-five languages and dialects, made him an exceptional explorer, as he could quickly learn new languages wherever he ventured.

While Burton's linguistic talents were widely admired, his interests in sex and ethnology were controversial and made him unwelcome in proper Victorian society. Nevertheless, he remained dedicated to his explorations and his desire to understand diverse cultures and religions.

Competing with Burton in language exams was Christopher Palmer Rigby, a skilled linguist who, despite his own abilities, was bested by Burton. This further solidified Burton's reputation as an exceptional linguist and adventurer.

Burton's journey to Mecca was meticulously planned, assuming the character of Shaykh Abdullah and ensuring that his disguise was flawless. To enhance his cover, he underwent circumcision and hired a former khatib to sharpen his Islamic knowledge and grammar. Throughout the expedition, Burton's servant, Mohammed al-Basy√∫ni, remained watchful and suspicious, but the other pilgrims warmly embraced him as a fellow traveler, dismissing Mohammed's doubts.

Thanks to his extensive knowledge of Islam and languages, Burton successfully maintained his disguise and managed to enter the Kaaba, the holiest shrine in Mecca. Inside, he sketched a rough plan of the shrine while pretending to pray, achieving a moment of triumph in his daring expedition.

However, as his journey continued, Burton found himself physically and emotionally drained. He began to doubt the permanence of religious rebirth and contemplated his status as an outsider in England, where he would eventually return. Rather than seeking accolades, Burton looked forward to finding rest and solitude in Cairo, where he planned his next great expedition.

### Shadows
While staying at the Shepheard Hotel in Cairo, Richard Burton learns about the captivating tales of the Mountains of the Moon and the source of the Nile from the German missionary and explorer, Johann Krapf. Despite his success in Mecca, Burton continues to maintain his disguise as Shaykh Abdullah, donning Arabic clothing and conversing in Arabic to blend in with the locals.

During his time in Cairo, Burton's spirits wane as he reflects on his Hajj journey, regretting not crossing the Arabian Peninsula. However, his attention is soon captured by the fascinating stories brought back by Johann Krapf and his companions, Johannes Rebmann and Jakob Erhardt, who have been exploring East Africa for seventeen years. They speak of vast inland lakes and snow-capped mountains, and most notably, the mystery of the Nile's source, a Holy Grail of exploration that has intrigued adventurers for centuries.

The Mountains of the Moon are believed to be the location of the Nile's source, and the headwaters of the White Nile remain undiscovered. These tales deeply captivate Burton, and he becomes increasingly fascinated by Krapf's exploratory work. He is eager to meet the German missionary and learn more about his discoveries.

Inspired by the challenge and driven by his passion for exploration, Burton becomes determined to lead an expedition to find the source of the White Nile. He sees this quest as a unique opportunity for great achievement in the history of exploration, and he is eager to embark on this daring adventure to unlock one of the greatest mysteries of the African continent.

### Bond for Our Blood
The East India Company grants Richard Burton permission to search for the source of the Nile under two conditions. Firstly, he must commence his journey in Aden, cross the Gulf of Aden to Somaliland, and venture into the unexplored African interior. Despite being strategically significant for Britain's trade route, Somaliland was considered extremely perilous. The second condition stipulated that the East India Company would not be responsible for Burton's safety during his expedition. However, Burton preferred to embark on the journey without governmental interference and was undeterred by the potential dangers.

In Aden, Outram, the political resident and commandant, initially opposed Burton's expedition and attempted to prevent him from going to Somaliland. Concerns arose due to incidents of violence in the region, making some fear the consequences of exploration. However, Burton eventually convinced Outram to delay his journey until after the Berbera Fair, during which he could travel under the protection of caravans.

For his expedition, Burton invited three trusted fellow officers: Lieutenant G. E. Herne, skilled in photography and astronomy, William Stroyan, a geologist and surveyor, and Assistant Surgeon John Ellerton Stocks, a botanist and medic. Unfortunately, Stocks passed away before the journey, leaving the team without their botanist and medical expert, a loss that greatly shocked Burton. Replacing Stocks seemed almost impossible.

Around this time, John Hanning Speke, a young British officer with a passion for hunting rare animals, arrived in Aden. Speke sought Outram's assistance and approval to enter Somaliland for his hunting pursuits. Initially opposing Speke's plans, Outram suggested that if he joined Burton's expedition, he might be allowed to explore Somaliland. Eager to participate, Speke approached Burton and offered his services as a surveyor to replace Stocks in the expedition. Despite reservations about Speke's qualifications and knowledge of the region, Burton agreed to let him join.

Speke was thrilled to be part of the expedition, but Outram warned Burton about the responsibility he was taking on by bringing Speke along. Burton contemplated whether his decision to include Speke might have been influenced by pity or a sense of responsibility toward the young traveler. Nonetheless, with the team now assembled, the journey to find the source of the Nile was set to begin.

### The Abban
Despite the delay caused by the Berbera Fair, Richard Burton decides not to wait in Aden and instead sets off to explore the Ethiopian city of Harar. Meanwhile, with nothing else to do, John Hanning Speke volunteers to travel to the Wady Nogal, also known as the "Happy Valley," to gather information and purchase supplies for the upcoming expedition. However, during this time, the hired Abban named Sumunter takes advantage of the situation, causing disruptions and delays for Speke's expedition.

Speke eventually returns to Aden, where Burton is waiting after successfully exploring Harar himself. Tragic news arrives in Aden of Burton's mother's passing, adding a somber note to their preparations. Despite this, Burton files an official complaint against Sumunter and insists on prosecuting him, resulting in Sumunter's banishment.

Despite the banishment, some of the Somalis react with anger and threaten revenge, but Burton remains dismissive of their concerns as he prepares to embark on the expedition to find the source of the White Nile. As part of their preparations, the expedition hires guards from the Aden police force. However, it becomes apparent that these guards are inexperienced and ill-prepared for any potential conflicts they might encounter on the journey.

The expedition finally departs in shifts, but Burton grows increasingly concerned about Speke's state of mind. Speke had previously expressed a desire to be killed in Africa, which raises questions about his emotional and mental well-being. Despite the challenges and uncertainties, the team presses on with determination, ready to face the hardships and dangers that lie ahead in their quest to find the source of the White Nile.

### The Enemy Is Upon Us
On April 7, 1855, Richard Burton arrives in Berbera during the bustling Berbera Fair, a chaotic scene with thousands of merchants, cattle, and slaves. The expedition sets up camp about three-quarters of a mile from the town, near the sea. Comprising forty-two men, including officers Burton, Speke, Herne, and Stroyan, they hire guards from the Aden police force. However, these guards prove to be inexperienced.

Deciding to stay in Berbera until a ship carrying mail and surveying instruments from England arrives, Burton and his team await the opportune moment to continue their journey. On April 18, a ship comes with a few Somalis seeking to travel with the expedition, but Burton has to refuse most of them due to limited supplies.

Later that night, tragedy strikes as the camp is attacked by about 350 Somalis, leading to a fierce battle. Speke, Herne, and Burton valiantly defend the camp and fight back against the attackers. During the intense struggle, a javelin pierces Burton's face, causing severe injuries and knocking out four of his teeth. The impact leaves a jagged scar on Burton's cheek for the rest of his life.

After the attack, Burton's caravan commander takes him to find Speke, Herne, and Stroyan. In his injured state, Burton sends a man to seek help from the Arab ship crew they had shared a dinner with earlier. Despite his pain and faintness, Burton manages to make it to the ship after wandering until daybreak. The ship's crew removes the javelin from his face and saves his life.

Meanwhile, Speke endures capture by the Somalis and faces brutal torture. However, he manages to escape and is later found by the expedition's porters and the Somali women they intended to hire.

The ship's crew returns to the campsite and makes a heartbreaking discovery‚ÄîStroyan's lifeless body, bearing multiple wounds. They decide to leave Berbera and bury Stroyan at sea. Burton is overcome with guilt, blaming himself for the loss of his friend and the failure of the expedition. Despite the devastating events, the expedition must carry on, navigating the challenges and dangers that lie ahead.

## What Might Have Been, What Would Have Been
### Into the Mouth of Hell
After the Somaliland expedition, Richard Burton returns to England amidst the backdrop of the Crimean War, a conflict involving Russia against an alliance of British, French, Ottoman Turkish, and Sardinia-Piedmont forces. The war proves devastating, claiming the lives of hundreds of thousands due to logistical incompetence and harsh conditions. In the aftermath of his expedition's failure, Burton faces condemnation and criticism, eager to join the war in hopes of recovering his spirits.

During this time, Dr. George Buist and William Coghlan publicly criticize Burton's expedition and his leadership. Additionally, Burton's expedition companion, John Hanning Speke, begins to privately resent Burton's fame and leadership, feeling he should have been the true commander. Speke becomes upset by Burton's editing of his diary for publication, along with the commentary added at the end.

Despite his injuries sustained in Somaliland, Speke surprisingly recovers quickly and enthusiastically joins the Crimean War. During his time in the war, he befriends Laurence Oliphant, a young man with similar ambitions. Oliphant had published a pamphlet titled "The Coming Campaign," proposing a plan to relieve the Turkish-held town of Kars and to meet with Muslim leader Schamyl in the Caucasus Mountains. While Oliphant's interests are focused on battlefield strategy and the Crimean War, Speke remains keen on returning to Africa for exploration, despite his near-death experience.

On the other hand, Burton takes longer to recover from the attack in Somaliland, requiring medical treatment for his injuries. He is determined to seek retribution for his lost friend, Stroyan, by urging the government to demand the capture of the murderers and to halt the slave trade in Somali territories. Burton also becomes critical of Britain's military command, expressing his dismay over the incompetence and corruption he observes during the Crimean War.

In his pursuit of meaningful engagement, Burton secures a position as chief of staff to General W. F. Beatson. He later proposes a plan for the relief of Kars and a meeting with Schamyl, which intriguingly mirrors Oliphant's earlier ideas. This causes surprise and tension between Burton and Oliphant, as Burton publishes a letter about Schamyl, seemingly unaware of the jealousy and resentment directed towards him. These feelings of animosity will have significant consequences in the future.

### What a Curse Is a Heart
In August 1856, four months after the end of the Crimean War, Richard Burton found himself deeply enamored with a young woman named Isabel Arundell, whom he had first met six years earlier. Isabel hailed from an aristocratic and devout Catholic family with a long and distinguished history in Britain. Her upbringing had been strict and disciplined, a stark contrast to Burton's more independent and adventurous upbringing.

Isabel's fascination with the Romani people and their way of life began to develop, much to her mother's disapproval. Hagar, a Romani woman, had foretold Isabel's future, proclaiming that she would "cross the sea" and her destiny would be intertwined with the name "Burton."

At the age of nineteen, Isabel's first trip abroad was to Boulogne with her family, where she unexpectedly encountered Richard Burton once again. She found herself drawn to him, admiring the qualities she sought in a husband. However, her mother vehemently opposed the match, preferring a wealthy peer as a suitor for her daughter.

Despite her mother's resistance, Isabel's feelings for Burton grew stronger, and she became certain that he was the man she wanted to marry. A significant moment occurred during a party, where she cherished the sash and gloves she had worn while dancing with him, as his touch left a lasting impression on her heart.

Four years passed before Isabel saw Burton again, but during this time, her infatuation only intensified. She prayed for him daily, treasured his gloves, and avidly followed his adventurous accomplishments through his writings and articles.

Yearning for an adventurous life and eager to break free from her stifling and conventional upbringing, Isabel attempted to join Florence Nightingale's team as a battlefield nurse during the Crimean War. However, her application was rejected. Undeterred, she founded the Stella Club to aid soldiers' wives left destitute by the war.

In a surprising turn of events, Isabel crossed paths with Hagar Burton, who offered her cryptic reassurances about her future with Richard. Eventually, Isabel reunited with Burton in London's Botanical Gardens, where they spent time together, leading to a romantic proposal from him.

Despite the objections of her family and the challenges they would inevitably face, Isabel was resolute in her decision to marry Burton. Before he embarked on his journey to East Africa, she had an emotional experience, believing she had seen his apparition bidding her farewell and promising that they would be reunited in 1859.

### Horror Vacui
After returning from the Crimean War, John Hanning Speke visited the Royal Geographical Society's map room to meet with Richard Burton. The Society's map collection was extensive and supported by government funding since many members didn't pay their dues. Early European maps of Africa were riddled with mythical creatures and inaccuracies due to limited firsthand knowledge of the continent. African mapmaking varied from rock art to scarification, but European cartographers often ignored or dismissed these indigenous methods.

A particular map drawn by German missionaries Erhardt and Rebmann depicted a mysterious "inland sea" in East Africa, capturing the interest of scientific communities. Admiral Sir George Back endorsed an expedition to find the source of the White Nile, and Burton was chosen to lead it with Speke as his second-in-command. While the Royal Geographical Society provided some funding, it fell short of what was necessary for the ambitious endeavor.

Burton eagerly anticipated the expedition, but before sailing to Africa, he had to make an overland journey to Bombay to secure Speke's leave. Dr. John Steinha√ºser joined the expedition in Aden, and the group finally arrived in Zanzibar, where they prepared for their journey to discover the source of the White Nile. Zanzibar served as an important harbor for trade and exploration, attracting European explorers seeking supplies and guides for their inland ventures.

Controlled by the Sultanate of Oman after defeating the Portuguese, the island had a notorious slave market. Burton and Speke arrived during political upheaval following the sultan's death, complicating their plans for the expedition. They sought advice from missionary Johannes Rebmann about the dangers of traveling through Maasai territory, but Rebmann declined to join them.

As the journey progressed, tensions grew between Burton and Speke, with the latter harboring resentment and feeling deserving of more authority. Speke's quiet demeanor masked deep-seated self-esteem issues, leading to conflicts with Burton over the use of his diary and natural history collection for publication. Despite the strain, they continued to explore the East African coast, with Speke finding solace in hunting. Along the Pangani River, they encountered hippos and crocodiles, and despite their disagreements, Burton found himself captivated by the beauty of Africa, especially the tranquility of the Pangani River at night.

### Bombay
During their expedition, Burton and Speke made a stop at Chogu√©, a small military station situated along the Pangani River. They were in search of additional men to bolster their team. At the station, they managed to recruit five Baloch men and acquired four slave-servants and two guides.

Among the men present at the station was a Yao individual named Sidi Mubarak Bombay. His past was marked by slavery, having been enslaved as a child and later attaining freedom. The Yao people were part of the Bantu-speaking groups, known for their agricultural skills and ivory trading. Unfortunately, some Yao individuals were also involved in the slave trade.

Bombay's life had taken a harrowing turn when he was kidnapped from his village and sold into slavery on Kilwa, a slave market island near Zanzibar. Despite the brutalities of the journey, he survived and eventually found himself in Gujarat, India. In India, enslaved Africans often served as soldiers or guards for powerful maharajas and occasionally ruled their own kingdoms. Bombay obtained his freedom after his owner's death and chose to return to Zanzibar.

However, the limited opportunities in East Africa led Bombay to join Burton and Speke's expedition. His diverse talents, including proficiency in multiple languages, and his reputation for loyalty, bravery, and trustworthiness impressed Burton. As a result, Bombay was hired as the head gun carrier for the expedition.

Over the course of their journey, Speke also developed a fondness for Bombay, recognizing him as a reliable and engaging companion during their long and arduous adventure.

### Death Was Written
After their exploration in East Africa, Burton and Speke returned to Zanzibar, but their condition was severe due to a fever, likely typhoid. The British consul, Hamerton, provided them with treatment while also warning them about the perils that awaited them on their upcoming expedition. However, despite the warnings, Burton remained steadfast in his determination to continue the journey, choosing to wait for the end of the rainy season, known as Masika.

During their preparations, they gathered supplies and gifts, called kuhonga, for their journey into the East African interior. Burton also hired local men, including some of the sultan's servants and Baloch soldiers, to join their expedition. Consul Hamerton even offered financial assistance and rewards to the guide and escort.

When the rains subsided on June 16, they set sail to the mainland aboard a borrowed ship called the Art√©mise. Despite his own illness, Hamerton insisted on accompanying them to oversee their departure from the coast. They awaited the return of Said bin Salim and Ramji, who were supposed to bring more men, but they only managed to bring a few. With an insufficient number of men, they had to resort to hiring donkeys to carry their supplies.

During their time at the coast, Speke went on hunting trips for hippos, but Burton disapproved, seeing it as both a distraction and unnecessary cruelty if not for sustenance. In an effort to reduce the burden, they left behind some supplies and the iron lifeboat, Louisa, hiring more men to bring the rest of the baggage later.

Despite Burton's strong objections to slavery, some enslaved men were part of the expedition. However, he treated them well, showing his commitment to treating all members of the expedition with respect.

As the departure date approached, Consul Hamerton had to return to Zanzibar due to his health. Before leaving, he advised Burton to trust his instincts and disregard the opinions of armchair geographers. However, some members of the expedition were fearful of the perilous land they were about to traverse, sharing stories of deadly animals and ambushes.

Despite the challenges and setbacks, Burton's determination remained unwavering. The expedition had already faced numerous hardships and tragedies, leaving Burton to carry the weight of these misfortunes as they prepared to journey into the unknown.

### An Old Enemy
On June 27, 1857, the East African Expedition embarked on its journey towards Lake Tanganyika, guided by a blood-red flag. The caravan was comprised of men, pack animals, and gun carriers, traversing diverse and breathtaking landscapes. Along the way, they encountered signs left by previous travelers, aiding them in finding water sources and avoiding treacherous paths. The region they crossed was once ruled by the Chwezi people, but by the 19th century, it consisted of numerous autonomous kingdoms.

Burton had a keen fascination with the supernatural and sought prophecies from medicine men they encountered during their expedition. However, the journey was plagued by rumors of Consul Hamerton's death, leading to doubts and desertions among the men. Desertion and internal conflicts became significant issues, with nine porters leaving within a month. Fortunately, Bombay, the servant, played a crucial role in soothing tensions and resolving disputes among the expedition members.

Progress was slow, and in the first eighteen days, the caravan covered only 118 miles due to challenging conditions and unpredictable weather. The donkeys, essential for carrying supplies, were difficult to handle and suffered significant losses along the journey. Moreover, the scientific equipment often malfunctioned, and the men faced hardships while working in harsh conditions.

Throughout their trek, they encountered a diverse range of landscapes, from grasslands to jungles, observing various flora and fauna, such as zebras, giraffes, antelopes, and monkeys. The jungles were a preferred habitat for elephants due to their abundant food supply and inaccessibility to ivory hunters. However, the jungles were also home to dangerous ant species that posed threats to both animals and humans.

In this environment, the men feared lions but found that attacks on humans were rare. Instead, diseases like fevers and smallpox proved more deadly. Starvation became a pressing issue as their supplies rapidly depleted, and acquiring food became increasingly difficult.

Both Burton and Speke fell gravely ill during the expedition. Speke suffered from delirium, and Burton experienced fever-induced hallucinations. In desperate circumstances, the men resorted to hunting and consuming whatever animals they could find to survive.

As their situation grew dire, the expedition sent a letter to the Zanzibar consulate pleading for assistance. However, it would take several months before they received a response. Adding to their uncertainty, the new British consul at Zanzibar, Colonel Christopher Palmer Rigby, was known as an old adversary of Burton, leaving their hopes for assistance uncertain.

### Tanganyika
The East African Expedition endured a challenging journey, taking 134 days to cover roughly six hundred miles. When they reached Kazeh, an essential trading depot, they were nearly three-quarters of the way to Lake Tanganyika. Desperate for provisions, they rested in Kazeh, hoping for supplies from Zanzibar. Shaykh Snay bin Amir, a knowledgeable local, was hired to assist with supplies and porters. Snay corrected a map error, revealing the existence of three separate lakes: Nyasa, Tanganyika, and Nyanza.

Speke proposed changing their route to explore the larger Nyanza, but Burton was reluctant to abandon their quest for Tanganyika. Illness continued to plague the expedition in Kazeh, and Burton's health significantly deteriorated. Speke assumed temporary command and led some men and supplies ahead to Zimbili.

Upon reaching Lake Tanganyika, there was little fanfare. Burton was initially disappointed, but he soon became enchanted by the lake's beauty. Unfortunately, Speke, nearly blind due to illness, felt bitter about missing the sight of the lake. They settled in Ujiji, planning to find a way to sail on the lake, but Burton's sickness prevented him from traveling. So they awaited a boat on the lake's western shores.

As Speke slowly recovered, he began exploring the lake while still waiting for the boat. In early March, Speke prepared to set out for Kaseng√© to obtain the dhow needed for the voyage. The expedition set off in a crowded canoe, facing storms and the constant threat of crocodiles, and finally reached Kaseng√©. However, the Arab Shaykh Hamed bin Sulayyim was evasive about lending them the dhow they required.

Unable to secure the dhow, Speke and his men returned to Ujiji in disappointment. Despite his health issues, Burton decided to explore the lake in small canoes. Fortunately, a caravan arrived in Ujiji with much-needed supplies, including letters from home and news of a mutiny in India. Tragically, Burton's brother, Edward Speke, had been killed during the mutiny, and Hamerton, another member of the expedition, died while in Zanzibar.

Unfortunately, the supplies brought by the caravan were not as useful as expected, and the expedition had no choice but to leave Ujiji immediately. They embarked on the journey back to the coast and Zanzibar, putting an end to their hopes of fully surveying the lake and discovering the outlet of Tanganyika.

### To the End of the World
During their journey, Speke suggests a detour north to the Nyanza, but Burton initially resists the idea. Nevertheless, they leave Ujiji and head to Kazeh. As they progress, Burton's health improves, and he feels a sense of relief and accomplishment. However, Speke becomes restless and unhappy, longing to explore the Nyanza on his own. He learns about the Kivira River, which he believes flows from the Nyanza. After much discussion, Burton agrees to let Speke go on a separate expedition to the Nyanza.

Before departing, Speke insists on not dressing like an Arab for his journey. He tries to persuade Said, their main supporter, to accompany him, but faces resistance from the other men as well. Finally, Speke prepares for the journey with enough supplies for six weeks. His expedition to the Nyanza includes Bombay, Mabruki, Gaetano, one kirangozi, twenty pagazis, and ten guards, each armed with a gun. Throughout their expedition, they encounter various challenges, such as a pagazi strike due to demands for more cloth, and meetings with local rulers with their unique requests.

Speke and his team reach the Nyanza on July 30 and are amazed by its size and beauty. Speke becomes convinced that it is the source of the White Nile. After returning to Kazeh, Burton prepares for the final leg of their expedition. When Speke shares his discovery with Burton, Burton is skeptical and insists that they need more evidence. This reaction leaves Speke feeling resentful and suspecting that Burton wants to claim the discovery for himself. Burton suggests they return later to explore the lake together, but Speke has other plans and firmly believes that the discovery belongs to him.


## Fury
### The Knives Are Sheathed
During the expedition, Speke falls seriously ill with the "little irons" disease, enduring extreme pain and delirium. Bombay, a trusted member of the team, comes to Speke's aid, helping to alleviate his suffering and aiding in his recovery. As a result of Said's carelessness and extravagance, he is replaced by Bombay as the expedition's leader.

The journey encounters the deadly cholera epidemic on the coast, preventing them from exploring the Rufiji River. Eventually, they return to Zanzibar, only to find the island in political turmoil and further ravaged by the cholera outbreak. The dynamics between Rigby, the new British consul, and Burton are strained, leaving Burton sorrowful for the changes at the British consulate.

Speke, however, forges a friendship with Rigby and begins to share his grievances against Burton, feeling that his merits are not being recognized. Rigby adds fuel to Speke's fears that Burton might steal his discoveries and receive all the credit. Speke becomes increasingly concerned about Burton's intentions, even believing that Hamerton had warned him about Burton's ambitions.

Meanwhile, Burton is trying to honor the promises made by the late consul to their men, but Rigby refuses to provide additional payment for their efforts. Despite his own lingering health issues, Burton is determined to continue the expedition, but Speke is eager to return to England aboard the HMS Furious with Lord Elgin and Laurence Oliphant.

Before departing, Speke assures Burton that he won't present his discoveries to the Royal Geographical Society until they appear together. However, once aboard the HMS Furious, Speke changes his plans, deciding to present his findings separately, out of fear that Burton might take all the credit. Laurence Oliphant warns Speke to be wary of Burton's potential jealousy and advises him to secure command of the second expedition himself. The tension between Burton and Speke continues to escalate as they prepare for their respective paths.

### 'Twas Me He Shot
After three weeks on the HMS Furious, Speke returns to London and immediately claims to have discovered the source of the White Nile. He meets with Norton Shaw, the secretary of the Royal Geographical Society, and insists that the Nyanza is the true source. Shaw introduces Speke to Clements Markham, who remains skeptical of Speke's loyalty to Burton but still accompanies him to meet Sir Roderick Impey Murchison, the president of the Royal Geographical Society.

Impressed with Speke's achievements, Murchison agrees that Speke should lead the next expedition to East Africa. However, Burton returns to London two weeks later and is shocked to find that Speke has already given a lecture to the Society without him and has taken credit for their discoveries.

Murchison praises Speke's accomplishments and supports his leadership for the upcoming expedition, further solidifying Speke's triumph. The Royal Geographical Society convenes to consider proposals from both Burton and Speke for the return expedition, and Murchison advocates for Speke's leadership.

Burton, though more qualified, realizes that his controversial reputation and unconventional lifestyle might hinder his chances. His strained relationship with polite society is a result of his reputation for shocking stories and unconventional behavior. Isabel, Burton's love interest, recalls that he is often believed when joking but not when telling the truth.

Speke proposes returning to the Nyanza using the same route, and his proposal is accepted by the Royal Geographical Society. He requests ¬£5,000 and a prestigious warship for the expedition, but the Society agrees to provide only ¬£2,500. Meanwhile, John Blackwood, a prominent publisher, becomes interested in publishing Speke's travels.

In a cunning move, Speke encourages Rigby to accuse Burton of unfair treatment towards his men, leading to a reprimand from the Bombay government and an apology from the Royal Geographical Society. Burton defends himself against the accusations but is ultimately humiliated and censured.

Despite expressing regret for the situation, Speke continues to privately disdain Burton in his letters to Rigby. The rivalry and animosity between the two explorers intensify as they prepare for their separate journeys to East Africa.

### An Exile's Dream
Burton's defeat by Speke and the subsequent breakdown of their friendship plunged him into a state of deep despair and depression. Despite being separated from Burton for three long years, Isabel remained devoted to him and desperately longed to marry him. Their connection endured, and Isabel received an anonymous poem from Burton while he was still in Zanzibar. Shortly after, they reunited in England, but their path to marriage was obstructed by the strong opposition of Isabel's mother, Eliza.

During this challenging period, Burton's life seemed to crumble. His once-promising accomplishments and dreams appeared to be slipping away, and he faced the additional burden of witnessing his brother Edward suffer from mental illness. In an attempt to escape his troubles, Burton sought refuge in travel and sought various medical treatments. However, he could not shake off the profound pain and anguish that weighed heavily on his spirit.

The broken friendship with Speke affected Burton deeply, serving as a constant reminder of his failures and disappointments. The combination of these hardships contributed to his deteriorating health and overall sense of hopelessness. Burton's life had taken an unexpected turn, and he struggled to find solace amidst the turmoil he faced.

### Hard as Bricks
With plans for his own expedition, Speke understood the critical importance of choosing the right companions. Among them, he trusted Sidi Mubarak Bombay, who had proved to be a loyal and trustworthy companion, serving as his translator and guide. Initially considering his friend Edmund Smyth as a potential second in command, Speke eventually changed his mind, believing Smyth lacked the necessary toughness for the journey. Instead, he appointed James Augustus Grant, a modest and loyal friend, to be his second in command.

Securing funding and supplies for the expedition proved challenging for Speke. In search of assistance, he turned to John Petherick, an experienced explorer. Together with Grant, they diligently prepared for their upcoming journey. Despite the excitement and anticipation for the expedition, Speke couldn't shake the feelings of regret over the way things had turned out with Burton. Their once-close friendship had deteriorated, and despite Speke's desire to reconcile before his departure, Burton remained unwilling to do so.

As Speke and Grant readied themselves for their expedition, the weight of unresolved conflicts and strained relationships hung in the air. Despite the challenges ahead, they were determined to push forward and accomplish their mission, hoping that their new adventure would pave the way for new discoveries and triumphs.


## The Malignant Tongues of Friends
### The Prince
Upon his return to Zanzibar, Speke was warmly welcomed by his loyal companion, Sidi Mubarak Bombay, who had stood by him during their previous expedition. He met with the British consul, Rigby, and engaged in discussions about ancient Hindu maps that could potentially support his theories about the Mountains of the Moon and the Nile. During his time in Africa, Speke also took the opportunity to rename various geographical features and named the largest lake in Africa after Queen Victoria.

However, the expedition faced its share of challenges. Desertions, delays, and illnesses plagued their progress, slowing them down and depleting their provisions. News of Burton's book, "The Lake Regions of Central Africa," angered Speke, and he was determined to retaliate with his own writings to assert his perspective.

As they approached the Nyanza (Lake Victoria), they encountered the powerful kingdoms of Karagwe and Buganda. To secure better accommodations, Speke pretended to be royalty. Within the expedition group, tensions escalated when Bombay tried to win favor with the Wanguana porters using a magic potion. His actions were misinterpreted by Baraka, who accused him of trying to kill him. Speke's favoritism towards Baraka and punishment of Bombay further intensified the discord among the men.

Despite the conflicts, Speke remained resolute in his goal to reach the Nyanza and establish it as the source of the White Nile. He pushed forward, not overly concerned about missing John Petherick in Gondokoro, assuming that Petherick would wait for him.

At Urondogani, Speke finally reached the White Nile and sailed on it using boats he had purchased. There, he encountered Samuel Baker, another explorer who was planning his own expedition to find the source of the Nile. However, when Petherick, who was supposed to meet Speke, finally arrived in Gondokoro after a challenging journey, Speke refused his help, displaying a dismissive and ungrateful attitude towards Petherick and his wife, Katherine.

### Damn Their Souls
After his extensive travels, Richard Burton found himself adrift and frustrated with both himself and others. In an attempt to find a new purpose, he decided to venture to America alongside his friend John Steinha√ºser. Their journey had the aim of studying Native American tribes and Mormonism.

During his anthropological studies in America, Burton's approach was tainted by imperial arrogance and bitterness, coloring his observations. However, he did show some tolerance for Mormons and their practice of polygamy. Meanwhile, back in England, Isabel Arundell, Burton's love interest, was determined to become his wife despite her mother's objections. She prepared herself to be a suitable companion and support for Burton, learning various skills and writing rules for herself to fulfill her role as his partner.

Upon Burton's return to England, he and Isabel got married in a small ceremony at the Bavarian Catholic Church in London. However, their newlywed bliss was marred by a devastating fire that destroyed most of Burton's possessions, including rare manuscripts and personal writings.

Following their wedding, Burton was offered a consular appointment in West Africa, specifically on the island of Fernando Po, which he readily accepted. Despite the challenges of the location, he filled his days there with frenzied activity, exploring, and writing.

In England, Burton became a founding member of the Anthropological Society of London, where he promoted polygenism and held racist beliefs. Not content with the limitations of conventional societies, he also initiated the creation of the Cannibal Club, a secretive group that discussed taboo subjects and pornography. Among the members of this society was Algernon Charles Swinburne, a young poet, who penned a blasphemous poem that the members recited before their meetings.

### Neston Park
On June 23, 1863, the Royal Geographical Society held a special meeting, with John Hanning Speke as the honored speaker. Prior to the meeting, Speke had sent a telegram, boldly claiming to have finally settled the mystery of the source of the Nile. His successful expedition had earned him honors and fame, but it was not without its share of criticism. Critics pointed out errors in his maps and prose, tarnishing some of the glory of his achievement.

Speke's book, "Journal of the Discovery of the Source of the Nile," faced further scrutiny and controversy. It was alleged that the book was ghostwritten by John Hill Burton to make it more presentable, adding to the criticism that it contained false claims and personal attacks on others, including Richard Francis Burton and Samuel Baker. The accusation against James Augustus Grant of being "un-generous" caused strained relationships and further heated debate.

Speke's interactions with those close to him were filled with frustration and bitterness. He had to contend with Blackwood's criticism and Grant's absence during the publication of his book. His plans for another expedition to Africa were met with resistance, as the Royal Geographical Society did not offer their support. Concerns about his state of mind started to arise among some of his acquaintances.

A highly anticipated debate between Burton and Speke on the source of the White Nile was organized for the British Association meeting in Bath. However, before the debate could take place, Burton and Speke unexpectedly encountered each other. Speke was visibly disturbed by this encounter and chose to flee to his uncle's estate.

While hunting on the estate, a tragic accident occurred, and Speke accidentally shot himself, inflicting a fatal wound. Unfortunately, help arrived too late, and John Hanning Speke passed away, leaving behind a legacy of exploration and controversy.

### The Weary Heart Grows Cold
On the morning of September 16, Burton arrived at the scheduled debate, but to the audience's dismay, Speke did not show up, creating restlessness among the crowd. During the meeting of the Council of the Royal Geographical Society, news of Speke's death reached them, and Murchison announced it to the audience. In honor of Speke, a resolution was proposed.

Speke's death deeply affected Burton, and he struggled to convey his emotions. Speke's body was brought back to his family's church in Dowlish Wake, where he was laid to rest. Speculation arose about the circumstances of Speke's death, but little inquiry was allowed.

Burton's life was profoundly impacted, and he felt silenced by Speke's death. He and Isabel moved to various consulates, but Burton's physical and emotional strength declined. During their travels, Isabel found her own strength and independence, but Burton's transformation was internal and visible to those who knew him. Upon his return to England, he appeared ravaged and emotionally affected.

The resurfacing of a lost manuscript on Zanzibar brought back bitter memories for Burton. Reflecting on the sadness and solemnity of writing about the past decade and the losses he experienced, Burton remained hopeful that the Tanganyika was the true source of the White Nile, despite Speke's conflicting claim.

Meanwhile, Stanley, with the assistance of Sidi Mubarak Bombay, managed to find Livingstone and confirm that the Nyanza (Lake Victoria) was the actual source of the Nile. As a result, Burton's reputation declined, and he became a forgotten figure with little public interest in his writings.

However, Burton found fame and financial success through his translations of literary works like The Kama Sutra and The Arabian Nights. As time went on, his views on race evolved, and he came to accept the intellectual equality of Africans.

During this period, Burton met George Washburn Smalley, an American journalist, and discussed his translation of The Lusiads, a work that held personal significance to him. This translation would become a legacy and a source of comfort in his old age, regardless of public opinion. Despite the challenges and setbacks he faced, Burton's passion for exploration and knowledge remained a defining aspect of his life.
