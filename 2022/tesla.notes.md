## The Birth of the New Physics
- Introduction:
  - Einstein's theory of relativity emerged from discussions about the ether, a hypothetical medium for light transmission.
  - Newton, Faraday, and others had different views on the nature of ether and its role in explaining phenomena like gravity and electromagnetic forces.
- Michelson-Morley Experiment:
  - Michelson-Morley experiment in the 1880s aimed to detect the ether by measuring differences in light speed.
  - The experiment did not detect substantial differences, raising doubts about the existence of ether.
- Maxwell's Ether and Faraday's Views:
  - Maxwell and Faraday had theories about the ether as a medium for electromagnetic forces and light propagation.
  - Faraday described the ether as a web of lines of force, while Maxwell saw it as a uniform substance filling space.
- Einstein's Special Relativity:
  - Einstein's special relativity challenged the need for ether.
  - Einstein's theory stated that the speed of light is constant regardless of the observer's motion.
- Tesla's Views and Contributions:
  - Tesla believed in the existence of the ether and its role in transmitting electromagnetic energy.
  - Tesla's experiments with high-frequency AC currents and wireless power transmission contributed to his ideas about the ether.
- Quantum Mechanics and Relativity:
  - Dirac introduced the use of hypernumbers and integrated relativity with quantum physics.
  - The Higgs boson's discovery added to the understanding of mass and binding forces in particles.
- Higgs Field and Dark Energy:
  - The Higgs field is proposed as a medium that imparts mass to particles.
  - Dark energy, possibly originating from the Higgs field, accounts for missing mass in the universe.
- Ouspensky's Alternative Gravity Concept:
  - Ouspensky proposed an alternative to Newton's law of attraction using spirality and dynamic relationships between celestial bodies.
  - He suggested that the motion of celestial bodies is a consequence of their positions within a dynamic system.

## Tesla's Dynamic Theory of Gravity Grand Unification, the God Particle, Tesla, and Einstein
- Ether and Einstein's Theories:
  - Walter Isaacson's Einstein biography reveals Einstein's acknowledgment of the existence of an ether hypothesis.
  - Einstein believed the ether couldn't be detected but recognized its significance for general relativity.
  - Tesla disagreed with Einstein's theory of relativity and supported the idea of the ether's existence.
  - Tesla observed light bending around stars and planets due to the absorption of ether.
- Ether's Behavior and Significance:
  - The behavior of ether as both solid and fluid explained by motion.
  - Ether's potential to transmit vibrations even at extremely high frequencies considered.
  - Ether's rapid oscillation at tachyonic rates may be undetectable with current instrumentation.
- Particle Spin and Ether Connection:
  - Particle spin and its relation to the speed of light discussed.
  - Goudsmit and Uhlenbeck found that particles' spinning rates could exceed the speed of light.
  - The notion of elementary particles interfacing dimensions and connecting with the tachyonic realm.
- Ether and Gravity:
  - Tesla's dynamic theory of gravity proposed as an alternative to conventional gravity theories.
  - Gravity explained as a result of matter absorbing ether, causing bodies to be drawn toward each other.
  - Magnetism considered as fundamental as gravity, with magnetic vortices playing a role in the universe.
- Ether, Atomic Structure, and Energy:
  - Ether constantly absorbed by atoms, providing energy and stability.
  - Michael Hodges proposed that atoms' electron spins create a vacuum force that leads to gravitational attraction.
  - Tesla's misunderstanding of atomic energy and disintegration, contrasted with atomic bomb invention.
- Grand Unification and Ether's Role:
  - Einstein's struggle for grand unification of forces, including gravity and electromagnetism.
  - Particle spin and ether absorption explained as a process transforming etheric energy into electromagnetism.
  - The potential to unify gravity and electromagnetism through understanding particle spin and ether absorption.
- Quantum Entanglement and Tachyonic Realm:
  - Einstein's criticism of quantum mechanics regarding instantaneous information transfer (EPR effect).
  - Chinese experiment demonstrates quantum entanglement's potential for instantaneous information transfer.
  - Tachyonic realm explored through quantum entanglement, allowing for rapid communication.
- Ether's Nature and Matter's Origin:
  - Max Planck's perspective on matter and the force behind atomic particles' vibrations.
  - Ether as a primary substance flowing into the physical universe, contributing to atoms' composition.
  - Elementary particles interface with the etheric dimension to generate electromagnetic energy.
