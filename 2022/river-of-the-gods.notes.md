### Bond for Our Blood
- The East India Company agrees to let Burton search for the source of the Nile under two conditions.
- He must start the journey in Aden, cross the Gulf of Aden to Somaliland, and enter the African interior.
- Somaliland was strategically important for Britain's trade route and largely unexplored, but believed to be extremely dangerous.

## What Might Have Been, What Would Have Been
### Into the Mouth of Hell
- After the Somaliland expedition, Burton returns home to England amidst the Crimean War.
