## Introduction: Walking in Memphis

Johann Hari, the author, shares a poignant and relatable story about his godson, Adam, who developed an intense fascination with Elvis Presley from an early age. As Adam grew older, his struggle with focus and addiction to screens became apparent, mirroring the challenges faced by many in the modern era. In an attempt to help Adam break free from constant screen use and reconnect with reality, Johann made a decision to take him on a transformative trip to Graceland, the home of Elvis Presley.

The journey to Graceland turned out to be more than just a personal quest; it shed light on a pervasive issue affecting society. Johann observed how people, even in historically significant places like Graceland, were preoccupied with their screens, indicating a widespread obsession with technology. This revelation led Johann to a deeper understanding that attention problems are not merely individual failings but are influenced by systemic factors, such as the impact of technology and broader societal changes.

In his exploration of the attention crisis, Johann presents twelve deep forces that contribute to this phenomenon. The declining ability to focus not only affects individuals but also has far-reaching societal implications, impacting problem-solving and democracy itself. Recognizing the urgency of the issue, Johann emphasizes the need for both individual responsibility and collective action to address the attention crisis effectively.

In his book, Johann skillfully combines scientific evidence with personal anecdotes, weaving together stories of his own journey and experiences to delve into the core of the issue and propose potential solutions. Seeking to reclaim his own focus and reconnect with deeper thinking, Johann embarked on a digital detox, temporarily parting ways with his devices.

Through Johann Hari's thought-provoking narrative, readers are invited to confront their own relationships with technology, understand the profound consequences of the attention crisis, and contemplate the path towards restoring our collective ability to focus and engage more meaningfully with the world around us.

## Cause One: The Increase in Speed, Switching and Filtering

In his quest to reclaim his attention and disconnect from the internet's incessant pull, Johann Hari sets off on a journey to Provincetown. During this time, he comes to a sobering realization that his attention span has been severely impacted by constant internet use. He reflects on a scientific study that highlights the shrinking collective attention spans, a consequence of the overwhelming information overload we face in today's digital age. Flooded with an endless stream of data, people find it increasingly challenging to focus on individual topics, leading to a lack of depth in understanding and a feeling that the world is moving at an ever-accelerating pace.

Drawing from Sune Lehmann's research, Johann learns that our society seems to be sacrificing depth and genuine connection for the allure of constant online interactions and superficiality. The collective exhaustion of attention resources becomes more apparent as we find ourselves constantly bombarded with information. Johann experiences firsthand what it means to live within the finite limits of attention's resources during his time in Provincetown.

Yet, Johann also acknowledges that the acceleration of information and technology shows no signs of slowing down. There's a growing fear that our society may become divided, with an aware upper class who understand the risks associated with attention and a manipulated majority living inside the confines of their digital devices.

Amidst these concerns, Johann finds inspiration in his friend Sune's transformative journey. Sune successfully changed his life by limiting his use of social media, television, and instead immersing himself in reading books. Johann also delves into the implications of speed-reading, discovering that while it may increase reading pace, it comes at the cost of comprehension and engagement with complex material.

In pursuit of regaining focused attention, Johann explores deliberate slow practices like yoga, tai chi, and meditation, which have been proven to enhance attention and concentration. He confronts the myth of multitasking, uncovering that our brains can genuinely focus on only one or two thoughts at a time. Constantly switching between tasks results in negative consequences, including decreased performance, increased errors, reduced creativity, and impaired memory.

Johann discusses how modern distractions, particularly those arising from smartphones, significantly impair our ability to concentrate and maintain focus. The brain's natural filter for distractions becomes overwhelmed in our fast-paced environment, leading to decreased focus and mental exhaustion. By delving into these aspects of attention and technology, Johann Hari compels us to rethink our relationship with information and the devices that constantly vie for our focus and time.


## Cause Two: The Crippling of Our Flow States

In Provincetown, the author observes people constantly glued to their screens, and this realization hits close to home as he, too, recognizes his addiction to his phone. The absence of the device floods him with an angry panic, as if a part of his world has vanished. The constant use of the internet has also affected his reading habits, leading to a rushed and hyperactive style of reading. He finds it hard to focus, constantly feeling the impulse to check social media for validation and a sense of importance, which only adds to the distractions and diminishes his attention and sense of worth.

Amidst this struggle, the author learns about flow states â€“ a deep form of attention that can lead to happiness and fulfillment. Flow is achieved through monotasking, pursuing meaningful goals, and pushing oneself slightly beyond the comfort zone. This concept becomes apparent when observing his brother, Moricz, who finds flow late in life through his passion for collecting crystals, providing him with purpose and focus.

However, the author comes to understand that flow states are fragile and easily disrupted. To escape distraction and achieve flow, he must find positive and meaningful goals, such as his writing journey. Initially challenging and unenjoyable, with time, he begins experiencing flow states, overcoming difficulties and becoming more focused and engaged. Flow not only helps him during work but also leaves him feeling relaxed and open throughout the day.

During his time in Provincetown, he manages to write an impressive 92,000 words of his novel, which he attributes to the power of flow. Recognizing that recovery from the loss of attention requires replacing distractions with sources of flow, the burden of the internet and technology feels lifted, and he experiences a sense of relief and liberation.

He learns from Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi that the best experiences in life come from moments of flow, not from superficial reinforcements like social media likes. He comes to understand that there is a choice between fragmentation, which shrinks and angers, and flow, which expands and calms. Ultimately, he contemplates whether he wants to be driven by external rewards, like Skinner's pigeons, or find deep concentration and meaning, akin to Mihaly's painters. Embracing flow and integrating flow experiences into his everyday life becomes a meaningful pursuit.

## Cause Three: The Rise of Physical and Mental Exhaustion

In today's society, lack of sleep has emerged as a significant issue affecting attention and focus. More and more people are experiencing sleep deprivation, disrupting their body's natural rhythms and essential processes. This trend is partly fueled by the widespread use of artificial light and electronic devices, which negatively impact our ability to get a good night's rest.

Many individuals turn to prescription and over-the-counter sleep aids in search of a quick fix, but these are not effective substitutes for natural sleep. The truth is, our sleep patterns are crucial for emotional adaptation and memory consolidation, as evidenced by the role dreams play in these processes.

Addressing the sleep crisis requires personal lifestyle changes. Simple adjustments, such as limiting exposure to artificial light before bedtime and reducing phone use at night, can make a significant difference. For instance, charging your phone in a different room overnight and ensuring your sleep environment is cool or cold can contribute to better sleep quality.

The broader issue is that our society is perpetually stressed and overstimulated, making it challenging for many to slow down and prioritize proper rest. While it may seem obvious that getting enough sleep is essential for improving focus, there is often a gap between what we know we should do and what we feel we can do.

The author is driven to explore the forces that prevent us from implementing these improvements in our lives. By understanding the barriers that stand in the way of better sleep and increased focus, we can find ways to navigate and overcome them, ultimately improving our overall well-being and attention.


## Cause Four: The Collapse of Sustained Reading

In recent times, there has been a noticeable decline in the practice of deep reading, largely due to the rise of constant distractions in our digital age. The pervasive influence of social media has significantly impacted our attention spans, making it challenging to engage in sustained, immersive reading experiences.

Amidst this trend, the significance of reading books for fostering deep focus and understanding others becomes even more apparent. Unlike the fragmented nature of social media content, books provide a space for uninterrupted contemplation and a deeper exploration of ideas.

"The medium is the message" is a concept that highlights how different forms of media shape our thinking and perception of the world. Social media platforms, with their constant stream of bite-sized information and instant gratification, can foster a mindset that prioritizes surface-level engagement over in-depth understanding.

Reading fiction, on the other hand, has been linked to an increase in empathy. By immersing ourselves in the lives and experiences of fictional characters, we can develop a deeper understanding of human emotions and perspectives, ultimately cultivating empathy towards others.

However, the effects of social media on empathy and consciousness are cause for concern. The continuous exposure to curated content and echo chambers can lead to a narrowing of perspectives and a decreased ability to empathize with diverse viewpoints.

Empathy is an invaluable trait, particularly in a world facing numerous complex and interconnected challenges. By nurturing empathy, we can better understand the experiences of others, which is essential for fostering cooperation and finding collective solutions to global problems.

In this context, it becomes essential to strike a balance between our digital engagement and offline experiences, making deliberate choices to prioritize deep reading and cultivate empathy in an increasingly distracted and fast-paced world.


## Cause Five: The Disruption of Mind-Wandering

The dominant image of attention is often likened to a spotlight, where our focus is directed towards a single focal point in our environment. Attention is commonly defined as a person's ability to selectively attend to specific stimuli or information while filtering out others.

However, there is another form of attention known as mind-wandering, which serves a different purpose. Mind-wandering allows our thoughts to roam freely, enabling us to make sense of the world, form new connections, and engage in mental time-travel. This type of attention can be beneficial, particularly in low-stress and safe situations, as it can lead to creativity and unique insights.

Yet, mind-wandering can turn into torment when experienced in high-stress or dangerous situations. The constant switching between tasks and distractions in our current culture has resulted in a crisis of lost mind-wandering, making it difficult for individuals to fully engage in this important cognitive process.

Technology, such as smartphones and the internet, contributes significantly to constant distraction, further reducing opportunities for mind-wandering. To address this issue, tools like Freedom and the kSafe have been developed to help limit technology usage and create space for focused attention and mind-wandering.

The author had personal experiences with the challenges of maintaining focus and mind-wandering, particularly after returning to the online world from a mindful retreat in Provincetown. The allure of distractions and disruptions online posed a significant obstacle.

However, the author came to realize that there were deeper factors influencing their ability to maintain attention and mind-wandering, and they sought to explore these underlying forces further. Understanding these influences is essential for navigating the modern world's attention-demanding landscape and finding ways to reclaim our capacity for deep focus and creative thought.

## Cause Six: The Rise of Technology That Can Track and Manipulate You (Part One)

James Williams, a former Google strategist, cautions against relying solely on digital detox as a solution to attention problems. He emphasizes that our attention is being profoundly altered by pervasive forces in society, and individual abstention from technology is not enough to address the underlying issue.

Our technology is actively harming our ability to pay attention, and Williams identifies six ways in which this occurs. Moreover, he points out a deeper, underlying force that is at play, influencing our attention in ways we may not fully comprehend.

Magicians serve as an illustrative example of how attention can be manipulated, revealing the limits and vulnerabilities of the human mind. In a similar vein, Tristan Harris, another former Google engineer, sheds light on the persuasive techniques used to alter people's behavior through technology.

Tristan's experiences at Google led him to design an app to combat distractions, but he soon realized that the company's focus was on increasing engagement to boost ad revenue. Becoming Google's first "design ethicist," he faced challenges trying to change the business model, which thrived on capturing and retaining users' attention.

The incentives of the attention economy make it difficult for companies to prioritize users' well-being over profit. Tristan's experiences left him feeling hopeless about altering the vast attention economy.

Aza Raskin, son of the Macintosh inventor, shares similar concerns about technology's impact on attention and seeks change. Despite being taught that technology extends human capabilities, Aza became a successful coder and internet browser designer.

His creation of "infinite scroll," adopted by many social media sites, removed the need for active choice when browsing. However, Aza noticed that this innovation led to addictive behavior, with people spending significantly more time on social media as a result.

Calculating that infinite scroll results in an additional 50% more time spent on social media, Aza realized that the technology he designed was responsible for an astonishing 200,000 more human lifetimes of scrolling every day.

The realization that easy-to-use technology may not always be beneficial for humanity left Aza feeling uncomfortable with the direction of his work and its impact on society. As a response, he created an app called Post-Social to encourage real-world interactions, but investors prioritized capturing attention over promoting genuine connections.

Aza's moral dilemma is not unique; many tech designers faced similar crises of conscience. Tech dissidents started speaking out against addictive technology, and insiders from Silicon Valley expressed concerns about its detrimental effects.

Sean Parker, an early investor in Facebook, admitted to exploiting human psychology to maximize user attention. Chamath Palihapitiya, a former Facebook VP, even prohibited his own children from using social media due to its negative impact.

Tony Fadell, the co-inventor of the iPhone, also expressed concerns about its broader impact on society. Silicon Valley insiders predicted that technology addiction would continue to worsen, sparking ethical debates among tech designers and society at large.


## Cause Six: The Rise of Technology That Can Track and Manipulate You (Part Two)

The design of popular social media platforms, such as Facebook and YouTube, is having a detrimental impact on our attention and focus. Instead of promoting meaningful interactions, these platforms prioritize maximizing screen time to keep users hooked for extended periods. They achieve this through algorithms that encourage addictive behavior, pushing users to engage in constant scrolling and browsing.

The algorithms employed by social media sites prioritize showing content that triggers strong emotional reactions, particularly anger, as it tends to keep users engaged for longer. This strategy has contributed to addiction-like behaviors and a breakdown in collective attention and societal cohesion. False information is also spread rampantly, leading to further division and problems in society.

YouTube's algorithm, for instance, often recommends extreme and conspiratorial content, leading to radicalization and polarization of its users. The current design of these platforms is not inevitable; it is a conscious choice. There are alternative ways to design technology that respects users' attention and well-being.

The impact of social media algorithms was evident during Brazil's election, where Jair Bolsonaro's extreme views and divisive rhetoric were amplified through these platforms, ultimately leading to his election as President. Misinformation played a significant role, influencing public opinion and the election outcome. The rage-driven algorithms of social media perpetuated unreality and divisiveness, leading people further away from critical thinking and rationality.

The consequences of these algorithms go beyond the political realm. Bolsonaro's policies, influenced by social media, resulted in increased violence, particularly in the favelas, and contributed to the destruction of the Amazon rainforest, further exacerbating the climate crisis.

Engineers working on recommendation algorithms often lack a comprehensive understanding of the full effects of their technology, similar to historical tales of losing control over creations. This has led to downgraded attention spans and truth-seeking abilities in society, hindering our ability to address pressing global challenges like climate change.

The urgency to change the social media machinery that steals attention and focus is evident. Addressing the detrimental impact of social media algorithms is crucial to tackle urgent global problems and regain control over our collective attention and focus.


## Cause Seven: The Rise of Cruel Optimism (or: Why Individual Changes are an Important Start, But Not Enough)

Nir Eyal's wake-up call came when he realized that he was neglecting his own daughter due to constant smartphone distractions. With a background in studying persuasive technologies and working with influential companies in Silicon Valley, he understood the powerful mechanisms behind these distractions. He believed that individual skills were essential to resist these temptations, drawing a parallel with his personal experience of overcoming obesity, where self-discipline played a crucial role.

To help people deal with attention problems, Nir offered practical suggestions. He advocated for identifying internal triggers that lead to distraction and implementing strategies like the "ten-minute rule," allowing oneself a short period of indulgence before getting back on track. Time-boxing was another technique he suggested, allocating specific time frames for tasks to enhance focus and productivity.

However, Nir also introduced the concept of "cruel optimism," pointing out that relying solely on individual solutions might be misguided. The attention crisis, much like the obesity crisis, requires more than just personal efforts. He argued for systemic changes that address the root causes of distraction and regain control over our attention.

Drawing a comparison between the obesity crisis and the attention crisis, Nir emphasized that both issues demand broader changes at the societal level. Simply telling individuals to change their behavior won't be sufficient to solve the attention crisis. Instead, collective action is necessary to reshape the environment that fosters distraction and create a culture that supports focused and mindful living.

## The First Glimpses of the Deeper Solution

The author raises two urgent questions that need immediate attention: how to prevent invasive technology from harming attention and focus, and how to compel big corporations to make necessary changes. To address the issue, Tristan and Aza propose banning surveillance capitalism, a system that involves tracking users online, selling private data, and manipulating behavior. They draw historical precedents, like banning lead paint and CFCs, to highlight the possibility of taking strong regulatory actions to protect people's attention and well-being.

Redesigning social media platforms is another crucial step after a ban. Companies like Facebook could consider alternative models such as subscription-based services or even public ownership, ensuring that their interests align with those of the users. However, leaked internal documents from Facebook reveal the company's awareness of promoting divisiveness through algorithms but failing to take adequate action due to business interests.

Drawing parallels with historical movements like feminism and LGBTQ+ rights, the author emphasizes that ordinary people coming together can challenge powerful forces. This collective action is necessary to address the rapid advancement of invasive technologies that threaten to fracture our attention and understanding of how we function.

The future of technology poses further risks, as unregulated surveillance capitalism becomes more invasive and sophisticated. Technologies like "style transfer" and emotion-detecting cameras enable persuasive targeted emails and manipulative practices. To protect individual agency and free will, regulation is crucial, and there is still a chance to bring about changes in web and digital technology.

Recognizing the need for a movement that advocates for technologies that serve us, enhancing focus rather than undermining it, the author points to current leaders in this domain, such as Professor Shoshana Zuboff, Tristan, and Aza. These advocates are akin to the early pioneers of feminism in the 1960s, fighting for a technology landscape that respects people's attention and well-being.

The author urges everyone to make a decision: either join the fight for humane technology and demand change, or passively allow invasive technologies to prevail unchallenged. The future of our attention and focus depends on collective action and advocacy for technologies that prioritize human welfare over profit-driven interests.

## Cause Eight: The Surge in Stress and How It Is Triggering Vigilance

Initially, the author attributed his attention problems to the internet and cellphones, believing that these technologies were the primary culprits. However, as he delved deeper into the issue, he realized that it was the business model behind technology that played a more crucial role than the technology itself. The way these technologies were designed to capture attention and keep users engaged was the key factor driving the attention crisis.

Moreover, the timing of these invasive technologies coincided with a period when people were already vulnerable to being hijacked by them due to various stressors unrelated to technology. To gain a clearer understanding, the author commissioned a scientific opinion poll on attention, which highlighted stress as the leading reason for attention problems. This finding shed light on the broader societal factors that contributed to the crisis.

Childhood trauma emerged as another significant factor affecting attention and focus. Individuals who experienced abuse or adverse experiences during their formative years were more likely to struggle with attention difficulties later in life. Hypervigilance, a response to danger, was identified as one of the consequences of such trauma, which further impaired attention as the brain remained fixated on potential threats.

The impact of financial stress and economic insecurity on attention was also brought to the author's attention. Research revealed that people facing financial struggles had diminished focus and attention capacity. Interestingly, Finland's universal basic income experiment demonstrated that providing financial security improved people's ability to focus, highlighting the link between financial well-being and attention.

The increase in work hours over time has exacerbated the attention crisis. With mounting demands and an unsustainable workload, people faced decreased focus and productivity. To tackle attention problems effectively, the author advocates for addressing the root causes, including stress, trauma, and financial insecurity. By creating a more supportive and secure environment, individuals can experience improvements in their attention and focus, leading to a healthier relationship with technology and a more balanced life.

## The Places That Figured Out How to Reverse the Surge in Speed and Exhaustion

Andrew Barnes had firsthand experience working in the City of London during the 1987 financial sector deregulation. The culture there was marked by overwork and long hours, with personal life often sacrificed in pursuit of ambition. Seeking a change, Andrew relocated to Australia and New Zealand, where he achieved success but still felt the lingering effects of his past overwork.

In 2018, Andrew stumbled upon research on productivity that revealed a surprising fact: workers were actually engaged for only a few hours a day. Intrigued by this finding, he decided to experiment with a four-day workweek at Perpetual Guardian, his own company. The employees would still receive the same wages, but the expectation was that they would be more focused during their working hours.

To Andrew's delight, the experiment yielded positive results. Productivity increased, distractions decreased, and overall well-being improved. Similar experiments in other places showed comparable outcomes, with both increased productivity and higher levels of employee satisfaction.

However, implementing a four-day workweek on a larger scale requires collective action and a fundamental shift in societal norms and labor practices. The rise of the gig economy poses a challenge, and rebuilding unions may be necessary to ensure fair and equitable changes.

Contrary to expectations, the Covid-19 pandemic did not lead to increased rest and leisure; rather, work hours increased for many individuals. This underscores the need for a collective effort to redefine work culture and restore attention and time for leisure.

Taking cues from the French government's "right to disconnect" law, granting employees the right to set boundaries on work hours and email communication, legal rights and collective struggle become essential elements in reclaiming time and restoring balance in the modern work culture. The story of the four-day workweek in New Zealand serves as a compelling example of how a collective push for change can reshape the way we approach work and leisure.

## Causes Nine and Ten: Our Deteriorating Diets and Rising Pollution

During the author's childhood, summers were spent with Swiss grandparents who lived a traditional, self-sustaining lifestyle. However, growing up in suburban London meant a diet filled with unhealthy processed and fried foods. Nutritionists and experts now argue that modern diets, characterized by regular energy spikes and crashes, are detrimental to focus and attention.

The impact of processed and ultra-processed foods, combined with exposure to pollutants, can significantly affect brain development and function. Notably, lead, once commonly used in gasoline and paint, severely impairs attention and cognitive abilities. Air pollution and industrial chemicals also contribute to difficulties in focusing and paying attention.

Addressing the attention crisis requires more than individual efforts; it demands structural changes and collective action. The European Parliament commissioned a researcher to study the effects of chemicals on early brain development due to hormonal interference. Many chemicals found in the environment act as endocrine disruptors, influencing human brain development and attention.

From 2005 to 2012, studies on several common substances provided evidence of their impact on the endocrine system. Present-day children are being born "precontaminated" with a "toxic cocktail" of these chemicals. While some scientists dispute these claims, their research funding sources raise concerns about potential conflicts of interest.

Challenges arise in avoiding pollutants individually due to their widespread presence. The author suggests subjecting new chemicals and pollutants to safety testing before allowing widespread use, similar to drug testing. Research on existing chemicals should be independent of industry funding, and harmful substances should be prohibited.

The need for transitioning to electric cars and planting trees in pollution hotspots is crucial to reduce air pollution and safeguard brain function. Exposure to pollutants and chemicals compromises the brain's normal functioning, emphasizing the importance of protecting our brains from environmental hazards.

Ultimately, how we safeguarded or neglected our brains in the face of environmental hazards will be a defining aspect of our era, shaping future perceptions of our time.


## Cause Eleven: The Rise of ADHD and How We Are Responding to It

Around fifteen years ago, there was a noticeable increase in the number of children being diagnosed with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). This surge led to a prevailing belief that children with ADHD suffered from a biological disorder, resulting in a significant rise in diagnoses and prescriptions for stimulant drugs like Adderall and Ritalin.

However, serious scientists remain divided on the nature of ADHD. Some argue that it is a genuine biological illness, while others emphasize the role of environmental factors in its development. Dr. Sami Timimi, a prominent child psychiatrist in Britain, adopts a different approach, focusing on understanding and addressing the underlying problems rather than simply medicating the symptoms.

A long-term study led by Alan Sroufe shed light on the impact of the surrounding environment, particularly stress levels and lack of social support, in contributing to attention problems in children. This research suggests that providing support and creating a stable and calm environment can help children overcome attention difficulties.

While stimulants like Adderall and Ritalin have shown significant short-term improvements in a child's attention, concerns have arisen regarding their overdiagnosis and overprescription. In fact, these stimulants are not only used to treat ADHD in children but are also used by adults to enhance concentration during work projects. In an Australian clinical experiment, a stimulant was even used to treat methamphetamine addiction due to chemical similarities between the two substances.

However, the use of stimulants for ADHD treatment comes with risks, including potential growth stunting and heart problems. Furthermore, the long-term effects of stimulant use on brain development remain uncertain.

While some studies have linked ADHD to genetics based on twin studies, newer techniques suggest that environmental factors may play a more significant role, accounting for about 20 to 30 percent of attention problems.

In light of these findings, it becomes crucial to address the environmental factors contributing to ADHD and to view stimulants as a temporary relief rather than the sole solution for children facing attention challenges. Ethical treatment should focus on creating supportive environments and understanding the complexities of ADHD beyond a simple biological explanation.

## Cause Twelve: The Confinement of Our Children, Both Physically and Psychologically

Childhood has undergone a significant transformation over the past few decades. It used to be a time of free play and independence, with children spending hours outdoors, exploring and playing without constant adult supervision. However, in recent times, childhood has become more structured and confined, with children spending more time indoors and under adult control.

This shift has had consequences for children's ability to pay attention and focus. Lack of free play and independence can hinder their development of crucial skills like creativity, imagination, problem-solving, and social bonds. It also robs them of the chance to learn how to cope with disappointment and frustration, which are important for emotional resilience.

A program called Let Grow is attempting to restore some of the lost elements of childhood. By encouraging children to engage in independent, unsupervised activities, Let Grow aims to provide them with opportunities to explore and learn freely. The program recognizes the importance of intrinsic motivation, where children engage in activities because they find them meaningful and enjoyable, rather than being compelled to do so.

The current school system has its shortcomings as well. Its focus on standardized testing and narrow academic pursuits may be hindering children's attention and focus. In contrast, Sudbury Valley School stands as an example of a radically different approach to education. This school allows children to pursue their interests and learn freely, without rigid schedules and formal lessons.

Research supports the idea that progressive schooling, emphasizing meaningful learning and freedom, can yield better outcomes for children in the long run. The success of Finland's education system, which prioritizes free play and less structured learning, further demonstrates the benefits of such an approach.

Author Johann Hari argues that the struggles children face with attention and focus are not inherent flaws in the children themselves but rather a reflection of the environment and system created for them. By providing children with more opportunities for independent exploration, play, and meaningful learning, we can support their natural curiosity and capacity for attention.
