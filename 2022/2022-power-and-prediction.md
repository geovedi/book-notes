# Power and Prediction
**Authors**: Ajay Agrawal, Joshua Gans, Avi Goldfarb | **Year**: 2022

## Summary
"Power and Prediction" reveals why AI adoption is happening much slower than expected despite its demonstrated capabilities. The authors argue we're living in "The Between Times" - a period between AI's technological breakthrough and its widespread economic impact, similar to electricity's forty-year adoption curve in the early 20th century. While their previous book "Prediction Machines" focused on AI as a drop-in replacement for prediction tasks, this sequel reveals the real transformation will come from AI-powered system solutions that fundamentally redesign how organizations operate.

The book introduces a crucial distinction between three types of AI implementation: point solutions (simple replacements), application solutions (new AI-enabled capabilities), and system solutions (complete organizational redesign). Most current AI successes, like fraud detection at unicorn Verafin, are point solutions that fit existing workflows. The true revolution will require reimagining entire systems around AI's unique capabilities.

Business leaders and technologists will gain a framework for understanding why some AI deployments succeed while others stall, and how to position their organizations for the coming wave of system-level AI transformation rather than just incremental improvements.

## Core Insights

### The Between Times: Why AI Adoption Seems Slow
We're in a lag period between AI's proven capabilities and widespread implementation, just as electricity took forty years to transform society after Edison's light bulb. Only 3% of US factories had electricity twenty years after its invention, but half had it after forty years. Similarly, AI adoption is currently limited to point solutions that fit existing systems, while true transformation awaits system-level redesigns that require more time and coordination.

> "AI's light is on. But we need to do more. We are now in The Between Times for AI—between the demonstration of the technology's capability and the realization of its promise reflected in widespread adoption."

**Quick Take**: Don't mistake current slow adoption for AI's limited potential—system-level transformations take decades to unfold.

### Three Types of AI Solutions
The authors distinguish between point solutions (direct replacements for existing prediction tasks), application solutions (new AI-enabled products or services), and system solutions (complete organizational redesign around AI). Point solutions like Verafin's fraud detection succeed because they fit existing workflows. Application solutions create new capabilities but require redesign. System solutions offer the greatest value but demand fundamental organizational changes.

> "AI POINT SOLUTION: A prediction is valuable as a point solution if it improves an existing decision and that decision can be made independently. AI SYSTEM SOLUTION: A prediction is valuable as a system solution if it improves existing decisions or enables new decisions, but only if changes to how other decisions are made are implemented."

**Quick Take**: Most current AI successes are point solutions; the real value lies in system solutions that require reimagining entire workflows.

### AI as Prediction Technology
At its core, AI is simply a dramatic reduction in the cost of prediction. Like electricity decoupled power from its source, enabling fractionalized power for individual machines, AI decouples prediction from human judgment. This enables not just better existing decisions but entirely new decision architectures and business models that were previously impossible due to prediction costs.

> "Just as electricity enabled decoupling the machine from the power source and thus facilitated shifting the value proposition from 'lower fuel costs' to 'vastly more productive factory design,' AI enables decoupling prediction from the other aspects of a decision and thus facilitates shifting the value proposition from 'lower cost of prediction' to 'vastly more productive systems.'"

**Quick Take**: AI's real power isn't making predictions cheaper—it's enabling new decision architectures and business models.

### Rules as System Glue
Organizations rely on rules, habits, and processes to reduce cognitive load and coordinate complex decisions. These "rules are glue" hold systems together but also resist change. Successful AI adoption requires identifying which rules protect critical coordination versus which represent legacy constraints that could be redesigned with AI's new prediction capabilities.

**Quick Take**: Understanding why rules exist helps determine whether to work around them or redesign entire systems.

### The System-Change Dilemma
Incumbents face a difficult choice: adopt point solutions that preserve existing systems but offer limited value, or pursue system solutions that promise transformation but require abandoning current advantages. This dilemma explains why startups often lead system-level changes while incumbents focus on incremental improvements.

**Quick Take**: System change creates opportunities for new entrants while forcing incumbents to choose between incremental and transformational strategies.

### Power Shifts from System Change
AI-driven system changes will redistribute economic power within and across industries. The book examines how prediction improvements enabled new business models in electricity (from centralized generation to distributed markets) and suggests similar power shifts will occur as AI transforms decision architectures in healthcare, finance, transportation, and other sectors.

**Quick Take**: The biggest AI winners won't necessarily be those with the best algorithms, but those who design the new systems that capture the most value.

## Best Quotes
- "AI may be to the twenty-first century what electricity was to the twentieth. Anyone thinking about our economic future needs to ponder its implications."
- "When the light goes on, rather than everything changing, little does. AI's light is on. But we need to do more."
- "AI is the new electricity. It has the potential to transform every industry and to create huge economic value."
- "Our focus on the possibilities of prediction machines had blinded us to the probability of actual commercial deployments."
- "The transformation of the electricity industry involved a move from centralization to decentralization. But what is critical to remember is the implications of that with regard to who held power, not the electric kind but the economic kind."

## Action Items
- **Map your decision architecture**: Identify which decisions in your organization are prediction-heavy and could benefit from AI point solutions
- **Distinguish rules from constraints**: Analyze whether your processes exist for coordination reasons or simply because prediction was previously expensive
- **Scan for system opportunities**: Look beyond replacing existing predictions to envision entirely new decision architectures enabled by cheap prediction
- **Consider the power implications**: Think about how AI-driven system changes might shift competitive advantages in your industry
- **Plan for the long horizon**: Recognize that true AI transformation may take decades, not years, to unfold

## Questions to Consider
- Which decisions in your organization are prediction-limited versus coordination-limited?
- What would you do differently if prediction were essentially free?
- Which existing processes and rules would you abandon if you could redesign your organization today?
- Are you positioned to benefit from AI point solutions, or do you need to drive system-level change?
- Who gains power and who loses it as AI transforms decision-making in your industry?

## Conclusion
"Power and Prediction" is essential reading for understanding why AI adoption seems slower than promised and where the real transformation opportunities lie. The authors convincingly argue that we're still early in AI's impact curve, with the greatest value coming not from better versions of what we already do, but from entirely new systems designed around AI's unique prediction capabilities. While their previous book "Prediction Machines" explained AI's direct impact, this sequel reveals the deeper, more disruptive systemic changes that will determine who wins and loses in the AI era.

The book is worth your time if you're tired of superficial AI hype and want a realistic framework for understanding AI's true transformation potential. Its historical analogy to electricity adoption provides both sobering perspective on adoption timelines and optimistic guidance for where the greatest opportunities lie. For business leaders, the key insight is to look beyond point-solution improvements and start envisioning the system-level transformations that will define the next phase of AI's economic impact.
