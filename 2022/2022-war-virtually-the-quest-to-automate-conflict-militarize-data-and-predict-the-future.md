# War Virtually: The Quest to Automate Conflict, Militarize Data, and Predict the Future
**Authors**: Roberto J. González | **Year**: 2022 | **Category**: Technology & Computing

## Summary
"War Virtually" is a groundbreaking investigation into how the US military is racing to automate warfare through artificial intelligence, big data, and predictive algorithms. Anthropologist Roberto J. González reveals how we've entered "War 4.0" - an era where Pentagon officials dream of conflict without soldiers, battlefields without blood, and decisions without human judgment. The book exposes the dangerous convergence of Silicon Valley innovation and military power, showing how the same technologies that power our smartphones and social media are being weaponized for digital warfare.

This book is essential reading for anyone concerned about AI ethics, military technology, or the growing influence of Big Tech in our lives. González provides a critical lens through which to understand how data-driven warfare threatens to dehumanize conflict and create new systems of social control.

## Core Insights

### The Illusion of Bloodless War
The Pentagon is investing billions in the fantasy of "virtual warfare" - automated systems that promise conflict without human cost. But González reveals this as dangerous technological hubris. From Operation Igloo White in Vietnam to today's drone programs, the military has consistently overpromised what technology can deliver while underestimating its human costs. The reality is that virtual warfare makes it "virtually impossible" to comprehend the real human suffering it causes.

> "Virtual warfare makes it virtually impossible [to comprehend human costs]"

**Quick Take**: Automated warfare doesn't eliminate human suffering - it just makes it easier to ignore.

### Silicon Valley's Military Origins
The myth of Silicon Valley as purely entrepreneurial innovation is just that - a myth. González traces how companies like Google received their initial funding from DARPA and intelligence agencies through programs like the Massive Digital Data Systems (MDDS) initiative. Google Earth's origins lie with Keyhole, a CIA-funded company. The supposed divide between Big Tech and the military has never really existed.

**Quick Take**: Your favorite tech products likely have military roots you never knew about.

### Data as the New Oil
Your personal data - your location, relationships, preferences, and behaviors - has become the "new oil" for military applications. The Pentagon harvests massive amounts of information from smartphones, social media, and digital interactions to feed predictive algorithms and behavioral models. What users treat as free services are actually data collection systems for military and commercial exploitation.

**Quick Take**: Your digital life is fuel for the military-industrial complex.

### The Robot Soldiers Are Already Here
The US military spent $9.6 billion on unmanned systems in 2019 - more than the entire National Science Foundation budget. But despite the hype about autonomous weapons, the reality is messier. Soldiers develop complex relationships with battlefield robots, naming them, personalizing them, even holding military funerals for destroyed machines like "Boomer" the MARCbot. These human-machine bonds reveal the psychological costs of automated warfare.

**Quick Take**: The future of war isn't just about machines - it's about how humans relate to those machines.

### Prediction Is A Dangerous Fantasy
DARPA and Pentagon agencies have spent hundreds of millions on predictive warfare programs with little evidence they actually work. From W-ICEWS ($40+ million) to social simulation software, these attempts to crystal-ball the future consistently fail. The Arab Spring, ISIS emergence, and Russia's invasion of Crimea all caught intelligence agencies by surprise despite their massive data collection and predictive models.

**Quick Take**: Big data can't predict human behavior - it just creates expensive illusions of control.

### Cambridge Analytica Was Just the Beginning
The scandal that rocked Facebook and influenced elections was merely the visible tip of a much larger iceberg. González reveals how the SCL Group conducted psychological operations in over 100 political campaigns across 60 countries using the same data-driven techniques. Social media platforms have become battlegrounds for algorithmic manipulation and psychological warfare.

**Quick Take**: Election interference isn't a bug - it's a feature of data-driven warfare.

### Algorithmic Bias Amplifies Injustice
The promise of objective, data-driven decision-making ignores a fundamental problem: algorithms trained on biased data produce biased results. Facial recognition is significantly less accurate for women and people of color. Predictive policing systems like PredPol disproportionately target minority communities. When garbage data goes in, discriminatory decisions come out.

> "Data reflects our history, and our history has been very biased to date"

**Quick Take**: Algorithmic bias isn't a technical problem - it's a social justice problem.

## Best Quotes

- "The divide between the Pentagon and Silicon Valley is mostly a myth—it's never really existed"
- "Data reflects our history, and our history has been very biased to date"
- "You have to light that match, light that match, light that match, not knowing how often it's going to sputter and go out"
- "Those little bastards can develop a personality, and they save so many lives"

## Resistance and Action Items

- **Support tech worker activism**: Google employees successfully pressured the company to drop Project Maven. Microsoft workers protested HoloLens military contracts. Tech workers are organizing against dangerous applications of their work.
- **Demand algorithmic transparency**: Advocate for laws requiring companies and government agencies to audit algorithms for bias and disclose their data sources.
- **Protect your data**: Use privacy-focused tools, limit social media sharing, and understand that your digital footprint fuels military and commercial surveillance.
- **Support independent tech journalism**: Organizations like The Intercept and Techdirt expose military-tech collaborations that mainstream media often miss.
- **Join digital rights organizations**: Groups like EPIC, Foxglove, and Tech Inquiry work to expose and resist algorithmic abuse.

## Questions to Consider

1. If warfare becomes fully automated, who bears moral responsibility for civilian casualties?
2. How do we balance national security needs with protection of civil liberties in the age of big data?
3. Should tech workers have the right to refuse developing technologies they find unethical?
4. What happens when predictive algorithms make mistakes but humans blindly follow their recommendations?
5. Can we regulate military AI development without falling behind adversaries who won't?

## Conclusion
"War Virtually" is both a warning and a call to action. González reveals how the pursuit of automated warfare represents a dangerous convergence of technological optimism and militaristic thinking that threatens to further dehumanize conflict while creating unprecedented systems of social control. The book is essential reading for understanding how the same technologies that power our daily lives are being weaponized for digital warfare.

**Is this worth your time?** Absolutely. González provides a crucial framework for understanding one of the most significant developments in 21st-century warfare - the automated, data-driven pursuit of conflict that affects us all, whether we realize it or not. The biggest reason to read this book is to understand how your digital life is being militarized, and what you can do about it.

The author leaves us with a cautious optimism: while the military-industrial-tech complex seems overwhelming, growing resistance from tech workers and digital rights activists shows that change is possible. The question is whether we'll act before automated warfare becomes too entrenched to control.
