# Adobe Photoshop Lightroom Classic Classroom in a Book (2022 release)

**Authors**: Rafael Concepcion, Jan Kabili | **Year**: 2022

## Summary
This comprehensive guide teaches photographers how to master Adobe's two most powerful tools through practical, hands-on lessons. The book presents a complete workflow from importing and organizing photos in Lightroom to advanced editing techniques in both Lightroom and Photoshop, demonstrating how the two programs complement each other for professional-level results.

Perfect for photographers and digital artists who want to streamline their editing workflow, this book provides step-by-step instruction on everything from basic photo management to complex retouching and special effects. Readers learn to leverage Lightroom's non-destructive editing and organizational strengths alongside Photoshop's pixel-perfect precision tools.

## Core Framework: The Lightroom-Photoshop Workflow

### Phase 1: Import & Organize in Lightroom
The book begins with establishing a solid foundation for photo management through Lightroom's catalog system. A Lightroom catalog is essentially a database that tracks where your photos are stored and what adjustments you've made to them.

**Key Strategy**: Use a single catalog for all your images (the author manages 700,000+ images in one catalog). This prevents the "lost notebook" problem where you can't remember which catalog contains specific photos.

**Essential Setup Steps**:
1. Create a consistent folder structure for your photo storage
2. Import photos using Lightroom's import dialog (don't move files outside Lightroom)
3. Apply keywords, star ratings, and color labels during import
4. Use Collections to group related photos across different folders

> "An infinite amount of stuff that has nothing to do with pressing the shutter button goes into the making of a picture. Truth be told, in photography, you will find yourself involved with so many things, before and after the click of the shutter, that it often feels like the pictures themselves are the smallest part of the process."

**Quick Take**: Establish your organizational system first—efficiency comes from knowing exactly where every image lives and what you've done to it.

### Phase 2: Non-Destructive Editing in Lightroom's Develop Module
Lightroom's greatest strength is its non-destructive editing approach. Unlike traditional Photoshop editing, every adjustment in Lightroom can be modified or reverted at any time because the original file is never altered.

**Core Editing Tools**:
- **Basic Panel**: Handles exposure, contrast, highlights, shadows, whites, and blacks
- **Masking Tools**: New AI-powered tools including Select Sky, Select Subject, Color Range, and Luminance Range masking
- **Gradient Tools**: Linear and Radial gradients for selective adjustments
- **Local Adjustments**: Brush tools for precise, targeted edits

**Professional Workflow**:
1. Start with camera profiles to match your intended look
2. Make global adjustments in the Basic panel
3. Apply selective adjustments using masking tools
4. Use virtual copies and snapshots for exploring different versions
5. Sync adjustments across multiple photos when appropriate

**Quick Tip**: Press the Backslash (\) key to instantly compare your edited version with the original photo—this helps you assess your changes effectively.

### Phase 3: The Lightroom-Photoshop Round-Trip
This is where the book really shines, teaching you when and how to move between the two programs seamlessly.

**When to Use Photoshop**:
- Complex selections and masking beyond Lightroom's capabilities
- Content-Aware Fill for removing large objects
- Advanced skin retouching and body sculpting
- Combining multiple photos (HDR, panoramas, composites)
- Special effects and artistic filters

**Three Transfer Methods**:
1. **Edit Original**: Sends RAW file directly to Photoshop, changes saved as new TIF
2. **Edit a Copy**: Creates copy for Photoshop editing, preserving Lightroom original
3. **Edit as Smart Object**: Creates layered Photoshop file that can be re-edited in Lightroom

> "Photoshop is a destructive editor—your ability to reverse any amount of pushing and pulling of these pixels was limited by a finite number of undos. Close and save the document at a moment when you weren't satisfied with the picture, and when you reopened it, that edited picture was your starting point."

**Integration Strategy**: Always start in Lightroom for organization and basic adjustments, then move to Photoshop only when needed for specific tasks that require pixel-level control or advanced compositing.

### Phase 4: Portrait Retouching Workflow
The book provides a systematic approach to portrait enhancement that maintains natural results:

**Lightroom Portrait Workflow**:
1. Teeth whitening using the Brush tool with increased exposure and reduced saturation
2. Eye enhancement: lighten whites, enhance irises with increased texture and clarity
3. Skin softening using the Texture Brush (reduces fine lines while preserving skin texture)
4. Remove distractions with the Spot Removal tool

**Photoshop Portrait Enhancement**:
1. Advanced selections using Select Subject and Select and Mask workspace
2. Frequency separation for professional skin retouching
3. Dodge and burn for dimensional lighting effects
4. Liquify for subtle body shaping

**Quick Take**: The best retouching is invisible—enhance without making subjects look overly processed or artificial.

### Phase 5: Creative Effects & Special Projects
Beyond basic corrections, the book explores creative possibilities:

**Creative Techniques**:
- Instagram carousel creation combining multiple edited versions
- Artistic treatments using blend modes and textures
- HDR merging for high-contrast scenes
- Panorama stitching for wide landscapes
- Texture overlays and collage effects

**Export Strategies**:
- Create multiple export presets for different platforms (web, print, social media)
- Set up identity plates and watermarks for professional branding
- Use Lightroom's Print, Book, Slideshow, and Web modules for presentation

## Best Quotes

> "Although you could start with a top-down panel approach—beginning with the Basic panel and working your way down through the other panels—you won't need to use every panel on every photo. The use of any sliders in the Develop module is largely dependent on the type of problem you are trying to tackle in your picture."

> "While layers offer increased creativity and control, they also add to the overall complexity of the image, and the file size just gets bigger and bigger."

> "Remember, the catalog does not actually contain your images. Think of this as a really large digital notebook that contains a record of where your images are and what you've done to them."

## Action Items

- **Organize First**: Before importing photos, establish a clear folder structure and keyword system
- **Master Basic Panel**: Focus on learning the Basic panel adjustments first— Exposure, Contrast, Highlights, Shadows, Whites, Blacks
- **Practice Masking**: Spend time with Lightroom's new AI masking tools (Select Sky, Select Subject) for efficient selective editing
- **Learn Round-Trip Workflow**: Understand when to move from Lightroom to Photoshop and which transfer method to use
- **Create Export Presets**: Set up export presets for your common output needs (Instagram, print, email)

## Quick Wins

1. **Instant Before/After**: Press \ (backslash) in Lightroom's Develop module to instantly see your original image
2. **Reset Sliders**: Double-click any slider label in Lightroom to reset it to default
3. **Sync Edits**: Apply the same adjustments to multiple photos by selecting them and clicking "Sync"
4. **Virtual Copies**: Create multiple versions of the same photo without duplicating files
5. **Smart Objects**: Send photos to Photoshop as Smart Objects when you might need to re-edit them later

## Questions to Consider

- What specific types of photos do you edit most frequently, and which program's strengths align with those needs?
- How can you streamline your organizational system to prevent lost images and inefficient workflows?
- What aspects of your current editing process take the most time, and could these be automated or simplified?
- Are you using the right tool for each editing task, or could you work more efficiently by better leveraging both programs?

## Conclusion
