"Good Inside" by Becky Kennedy is a comprehensive parenting guide that offers valuable insights and practical strategies for building strong connections with children, promoting emotional well-being, and addressing challenging behaviors. Divided into two parts, the book presents Dr. Becky's Parenting Principles and explores Building Connection and Addressing Behaviors.

In the first part, "Dr. Becky's Parenting Principles," the author outlines essential principles for effective parenting. These principles include authentic communication, present-moment support, self-care, acknowledging and validating emotions, getting one's needs met, and practicing self-compassion. Dr. Becky emphasizes the importance of honest and open communication with children, focusing on providing comfort and guidance during challenging situations, and prioritizing self-care alongside parenting responsibilities.

The second part, "Building Connection and Addressing Behaviors," delves into strategies specifically tailored for deeply feeling kids (DFKs). Dr. Becky highlights the need to shift from blame to curiosity, understanding that DFKs experience emotions more intensely and can become easily overwhelmed. Containment is emphasized as a crucial strategy, where parents prioritize keeping the child safe by providing a calm space during moments of dysregulation.

Recognizing DFKs as "good kids having a hard time," Dr. Becky encourages parents to maintain a compassionate perspective and offer support and reassurance. The power of parental presence is emphasized as a tool for building connection and providing a sense of safety and acceptance. The Thumbs Up/Down/to the Side game is introduced as a playful approach to discussing feelings with resistant children, gradually increasing their tolerance for emotions and vulnerability.

The book concludes with a case example of Angie and her daughter Maura, demonstrating how the strategies can be implemented in real-life situations. Angie practices containment, reassures Maura of her goodness, and utilizes the Thumbs Up/Down/to the Side game to better understand her daughter's struggles.

Overall, "Good Inside" provides a comprehensive framework for nurturing strong parent-child connections, promoting emotional well-being, and addressing challenging behaviors. With Dr. Becky's principles and strategies, parents can create a supportive and loving environment that helps children regulate their emotions, develop resilience, and build healthy relationships.

## Dr. Becky's Parenting Principles
"Dr. Becky's Parenting Principles" focus on comprehensive approaches to parenting that aim to build strong parent-child connections, promote emotional well-being, and foster effective communication within families.

One fundamental aspect of these principles is authentic communication. Dr. Becky encourages parents to engage in honest and open conversations with their children, providing age-appropriate explanations and validation for their feelings and experiences. Present-moment support is also vital, as parents should focus on providing comfort, reassurance, and guidance during challenging situations to help their children navigate through them.

Another crucial aspect is self-care for parents. Dr. Becky emphasizes the importance of prioritizing self-care to maintain their well-being and positively impact overall family dynamics. Additionally, her "Acknowledge, Validate, Permit (AVP)" approach encourages parents to accept and validate their children's uncomfortable emotions, promoting emotional resilience and healthy coping strategies.

Dr. Becky also encourages parents to assert their needs and set boundaries while tolerating any discomfort that may arise. Starting with small self-care activities and developing self-prioritization skills through "One Thing for Myself" is an important step in this process. Moreover, she emphasizes the significance of practicing self-compassion and forgiveness for personal growth and learning, known as "Repairing with Yourself."

Cultivating stronger connections with children is central to Dr. Becky's principles. She encourages parents to attune to their children's emotions and needs, creating safe and supportive environments where children can freely express themselves. The power of connection plays a crucial role in children's emotional development, helping them build trust, empathy, and a sense of unconditional love.

Dr. Becky's principles also emphasize the value of open and honest dialogues with children, even in challenging situations, to foster understanding and emotional growth. She provides strategies for implementing effective discipline techniques that prioritize teaching and empathy, rather than punitive measures.

## Building Connection and Addressing Behaviors
Strategies to build connection with deeply feeling kids (DFKs) and address challenging behaviors involve understanding and empathizing with these children, who experience emotions more intensely and become easily overwhelmed. Instead of blaming them for their behavior, parents are encouraged to shift to a curious mindset to understand the child's underlying needs and fears.

One essential strategy is containment, which prioritizes keeping the child safe in moments of dysregulation by providing a smaller, calm space. Parents assert their role as sturdy leaders capable of handling the child's overwhelming emotions, creating a sense of safety for the DFK.

Maintaining a compassionate perspective is crucial, viewing the DFK as a "good kid having a hard time." Offering support and reassurance helps the child feel loved and committed to. The parent's calm and loving presence communicates safety and acceptance to the DFK, establishing a secure connection.

The "Thumbs Up/Down/to the Side" game allows the child to express agreement, disagreement, or mixed feelings about emotions without direct confrontation, promoting open communication and understanding. Creating a safe space for expression further increases the child's tolerance for emotions and vulnerability.

A case example of Angie and Maura illustrates these strategies in action. Angie practices containment and uses the Thumbs Up/Down/to the Side game to understand and support her daughter's struggles, fostering a strong connection with Maura.
