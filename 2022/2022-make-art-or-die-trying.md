**Authors**: Stuart Semple | **Year**: 2022

## Summary
"Make Art or Die Trying" is a revolutionary practical playbook that demolishes the barriers between everyday life and artistic creation. Stuart Semple delivers a raw, honest guide that transforms how you see creativity—arguing that art isn't about technical skill or expensive materials, but about ideas, courage, and the willingness to transform the ordinary into the extraordinary. The book is structured as a series of actionable frameworks and exercises designed to unleash your inner artist regardless of background, budget, or experience.

This guide is perfect for aspiring artists, creative professionals seeking renewal, or anyone who feels disconnected from their creative potential. Readers will gain practical tools for idea generation, confidence to create without permission, and a new understanding of how art can transform both their lives and the world around them.

## Core Insights

### Ideas Are Everything
Semple's foundational principle is that "the idea is the machine makes the work." He argues that you don't need technical skills, money, or resources—what matters is the quality and boldness of your ideas. Daydreaming is free, and your imagination is your most powerful tool. The book teaches you to capture ideas relentlessly and treat each one as already being art, even before it takes physical form.

> "Paintings crack and fade with age, eventually even marble can crumble, but ideas are things that can last forever because they were never things in the first place."

**Quick Take**: Start an ideas capture system today—notebook, voice recorder, or phone app—and document every creative impulse without judgment.

### Take the Creative Vow
Before diving in, Semple asks readers to take a solemn vow: "I solemnly swear to abandon all I know about making things look good, everything I believe about what is or is not art. I promise to cast aside all I've learned about composition, form, flourishes, and finesse. For now, I will focus on ideas and ideas alone." This liberation from conventional art rules is presented as essential for authentic creative expression.

**Quick Take**: Give yourself permission to be a beginner and abandon preconceptions about what constitutes "good art."

### Movement and Context Transform Everything
The "Move It" philosophy demonstrates how changing an object's location transforms it into art. A toilet paper roll in a gallery space becomes art. A balloon in a city square becomes a statement. By relocating everyday objects to unexpected contexts, you create meaning and challenge perceptions. This principle applies to life itself—changing your environment can unlock new perspectives.

> "I realised that balloons could, in the right context, look a little bit like eggs. My idea was to shift the usual environment in which you find balloons and install them at the crack of dawn all over the United Kingdom."

**Quick Take**: Take one ordinary object to three different locations and document how its meaning changes with context.

### Performance Is Life, Life Is Art
Semple breaks down the barrier between performance and daily existence, arguing that "your life is a performance; performance is art." Every action, choice, and interaction carries artistic potential. This philosophy transforms mundane activities into opportunities for creative expression and meaningful engagement with the world.

**Quick Take**: Choose one routine activity today and perform it with deliberate artistic intention, as if it were being watched by an audience.

### Steal Creatively and Collaborate Boldly
"Stealing is free. Make new things from the spoils." Semple champions the artistic tradition of appropriation and transformation—taking existing images, objects, and ideas and recontextualizing them into something new. He equally emphasizes collaboration as a force multiplier: "Form a crew, collaborate to punch hard."

**Quick Take**: Find three images or objects that inspire you and combine them into something entirely new.
