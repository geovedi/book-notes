# Impossible, Possible and Improbable
**Original Title**: Impossible, Possible and Improbable
**Authors**: John Gribbin | **Year**: 2022

## Summary
"Impossible, Possible and Improbable" is a collection of 21 essays that brings together John Gribbin's trilogy of scientific explorations: "Six Impossible Things" (quantum physics), "Seven Pillars of Science" (life sciences), and "Eight Improbable Possibilities" (cosmology and unexpected scientific discoveries). The title references Arthur Conan Doyle's famous Sherlock Holmes quote: "When you have excluded the impossible, whatever remains, however improbable, must be the truth."

This book represents what Gribbin calls "half the answer to life, the universe, and everything" - a playful nod to Douglas Adams' "The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy," where the answer is 42. Through these concise, accessible essays, Gribbin demonstrates that scientific truth is often stranger than fiction, challenging our common-sense understanding of reality.

The book is ideal for curious readers who want to understand the most fascinating and counterintuitive discoveries in modern science without getting overwhelmed by technical details. It offers insights into how scientists grapple with concepts that defy everyday experience, from quantum weirdness to the nature of consciousness to the fundamental structure of the universe.

## Core Insights

### The Quantum World: Six Impossible Things

The book begins with an exploration of quantum mechanics, describing it as "strange" because its rules defy our everyday "common sense" understanding of reality. Gribbin uses the famous double-slit experiment to illustrate how light and matter behave as both waves and particles, a phenomenon he calls "the only mystery" of quantum mechanics.

**Key Quantum Concepts:**
- **Wave-Particle Duality**: Individual electrons fired one at a time through double slits still create an interference pattern, as if they "know" about both paths
- **Quantum Entanglement**: Particles can remain connected across vast distances, with Einstein calling this "spooky action at a distance"
- **The "Quanta of Solace"**: Six different interpretations of quantum mechanics that physicists use to make sense of these bizarre phenomena

> "Quantum physics is strange. At least, it is strange to us, because the rules of the quantum world, which govern the way the world works at the level of atoms and subatomic particles, are not the rules that we are familiar with – the rules of what we call 'common sense'."

**Quick Take**: Quantum mechanics forces us to accept that reality at its most fundamental level operates according to principles that challenge our intuition, yet these principles have been experimentally verified countless times.

### Scientific Surprises: The Incredible Lightness of Ice

Gribbin explores how scientific discoveries often contradict our expectations. The example of ice being less dense than water (the "incredible lightness" of the title) demonstrates how seemingly simple observations can reveal profound truths about the nature of reality.

**Unexpected Scientific Truths:**
- Many fundamental scientific discoveries were initially considered impossible
- Nature often violates our "common sense" expectations
- Scientific progress frequently comes from accepting what seems improbable

**Quick Take**: The most valuable scientific insights often come from phenomena that initially seem impossible or contradictory to our everyday experience.

### The Nature of Scientific Knowledge

Throughout the essays, Gribbin emphasizes that science is a process of questioning and discovery rather than a collection of fixed facts. He shows how scientists must remain open to ideas that challenge their assumptions.

**Key Themes:**
- **The Limits of Intuition**: Our everyday experiences don't prepare us for quantum or cosmic realities
- **The Role of Interpretation**: In fields like quantum mechanics, the same mathematical equations can support multiple, equally valid interpretations
- **Scientific Humility**: The greatest scientists acknowledge how much they don't know

> "When I was younger, I always did it for half an hour a day. Why, sometimes I've believed as many as six impossible things before breakfast."

**Quick Take**: Scientific progress requires embracing ideas that seem impossible at first glance, while maintaining rigorous standards of evidence.

## Best Quotes

- "The attempt to conceive the quantum-theoretical description as the complete description of the individual systems leads to unnatural theoretical interpretations, which immediately become unnecessary if one accepts the interpretation that the description refers to ensembles of systems and not to individual systems."
  - Albert Einstein

- "When you have excluded the impossible, whatever remains, however improbable, must be the truth."
  - Arthur Conan Doyle

- "Quantum physics is strange. At least, it is strange to us, because the rules of the quantum world, which govern the way the world works at the level of atoms and subatomic particles, are not the rules that we are familiar with – the rules of what we call 'common sense'."

- "Truth is stranger than fiction, but it is because Fiction is obliged to stick to possibilities; Truth isn't."
  - Mark Twain

- "No familiar conceptions can be woven around the electron ... something unknown is doing we don't know what."

## Action Items

- **Embrace Scientific Curiosity**: Read about scientific discoveries that challenge your assumptions about reality
- **Question Common Sense**: Recognize that our everyday intuition may not apply to quantum or cosmic scales
- **Appreciate Scientific Uncertainty**: Understand that even the most successful theories have limitations and unanswered questions
- **Explore Multiple Perspectives**: Consider different interpretations of the same scientific evidence

## Questions to Consider

- How do we reconcile quantum weirdness with our everyday experience of a predictable, classical world?
- What does the success of quantum mechanics tell us about the nature of reality itself?
- Why are humans so resistant to ideas that contradict their common-sense understanding?
- How can scientific progress continue when we keep discovering phenomena that seem impossible?
- What role does interpretation play in how we understand scientific theories?

## Conclusion

"Impossible, Possible and Improbable" is definitely worth your time if you're fascinated by how science reveals a reality stranger than any fiction. Gribbin's accessible writing style and careful selection of topics make complex ideas approachable without oversimplifying them. The book's greatest strength is showing how scientists themselves grapple with concepts that challenge intuition, making the reader feel part of this ongoing quest for understanding.

The biggest reason to read this book is its ability to transform how you think about reality itself. By the end, you'll understand that "impossible" is often just a temporary label for phenomena we haven't yet learned to comprehend. Gribbin successfully demonstrates that the universe is far more mysterious and wonderful than our everyday experience suggests, and that embracing this uncertainty is key to both scientific progress and intellectual humility.
