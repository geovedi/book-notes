**Authors**: Kathy L Wheeler | **Year**: 2022

## Summary
Lady Pricilla, the fiercely independent and intelligent stepsister to Cinderella, serves as the Land Agent for the Kingdom of Chalmers. Unlike the traditional expectations for women of marriage and motherhood, Pricilla finds purpose in her work and has no desire for domestic life. When she encounters Sir Arnauld, Prince Charming's cousin with mysterious powers of compulsion, their worlds collide in a tale of political intrigue, danger, and unexpected romance.

Set against the backdrop of Cinderella's happily ever after, this story reimagines the "evil stepsister" trope as Pricilla and Arnauld work together to uncover a smuggling operation threatening the kingdom, all while navigating their growing attraction and the meddling of fairy godmothers.

**Perfect for readers who enjoy** historical romance with strong-willed heroines, magical elements, and fairytale retellings that give voice to traditionally misunderstood characters.

## Core Insights

### From Villain to Heroine
Pricilla represents the transformative power of redemption and growth. Unlike the traditional evil stepsister narrative, she acknowledges her past mistreatment of Cinderella but focuses on becoming a better person. Her journey shows that people are complex and capable of change, making her relatable despite her history as an antagonist.

> "She pushed away the guilt for her part in Cinde's adolescent misery, realizing in all honesty, past actions could not be altered. Only current actions were in her power."

**Quick Take**: Your past doesn't define your future - meaningful change comes from conscious daily choices rather than trying to erase what came before.

### Intelligence as Feminine Power
Pricilla challenges societal expectations by demonstrating that women's value extends beyond beauty and domestic skills. As Land Agent, she uses her intellect and organizational abilities to manage the kingdom's affairs, proving that capability and worth aren't gender-specific.

> "She, for one, had no use for either [marriage and babies]. Brains were useful organs, and she intended using hers to its full potential."

**Quick Take**: True power comes from developing and using your unique talents, regardless of gender expectations or social conventions.

### Love Beyond Social Expectations
The romance between Pricilla and Arnauld develops not through traditional courtship, but through mutual respect, shared danger, and recognition of each other's strengths. Arnauld falls for Pricilla's sharp mind and fierce independence rather than her compliance or beauty.

> "I am not marrying you for babies, my love. The 'such,' however, is an entirely different matter."

**Quick Take**: Authentic connection happens when people appreciate each other for who they truly are, not who society expects them to be.

### The Complexity of Power
Arnauld's magical ability to compel others creates both advantages and burdens. His powers make him valuable to the crown but also potentially dangerous, raising questions about the ethics of influence and the responsibility that comes with special abilities.

**Quick Take**: Power without wisdom creates as many problems as it solves, and true strength lies in knowing when to use your abilities and when to exercise restraint.

### Family Loyalty and Redemption
The story explores how families can overcome difficult pasts and rebuild relationships. Despite their history with Cinderella, the stepsisters demonstrate genuine care and growth, showing that family bonds can heal even after betrayal.

**Quick Take**: Forgiveness and growth within families require patience, understanding, and a willingness to see people as they are now, not just as they were.
