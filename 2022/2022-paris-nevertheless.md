# Paris Nevertheless
**Original Title**: Paris quand même
**Author**: Jean-Christophe Bailly | **Year**: 2022 

## Summary
"Paris quand même" (Paris Nevertheless) is a lyrical meditation on the enduring soul of Paris amid relentless transformation. Written during the early months of 2022, this collection of 37 short vignettes captures the tension between Paris as a seat of power and heritage versus its living, breathing identity as a city of resistance, memory, and spontaneous vitality. Bailly, a lifelong Parisian born in the city, documents both what has been lost and what mysteriously persists, moving between personal anecdote, architectural critique, and philosophical reflection on urban life.

This book will appeal to urban explorers, architecture enthusiasts, and anyone who has experienced the bittersweet sensation of watching a beloved city change while its essential character somehow endures. Readers will gain a deeper appreciation for Paris's layered history and the invisible forces that give cities their distinctive souls.

## Core Insights

### Paris's Double Nature: Capital City vs. Living City
Bailly identifies Paris as fundamentally "bifrons" - two-faced. On one side stands the official, tourist, and monumental Paris that performs its role as France's capital, obsessed with grandeur and heritage preservation. On the other exists the rebellious, improvisational Paris that maintains traditions of mixing, irony, and popular vitality. This split isn't new - it dates back to centralization - but has intensified under tourism and speculation pressures.

> "Between the city-capital, with its attributes and trophies, and the real city, the gap has remained constant, increased by the combined effects of tourism and speculation."
> _Original: "Entre la ville-capitale, avec ses attributs et ses trophées, et la ville réelle, l'écart est resté constant, accru par les effets cumulés du tourisme et de la spéculation."_

**Quick Take**: Every major city contains this tension between its official narrative and its lived reality, but Paris embodies it with particular intensity.

### The Art of Urban Walking: From Rousseau to the Situationists
Bailly traces a rich tradition of urban exploration beginning with Rousseau's famous 1776 walk to Ménilmontant, where he was knocked down by a Great Dane. This accident produced a remarkable description of returning to consciousness at street level. Through figures like Baudelaire, Apollinaire, and the Situationists, he shows how Paris became the world capital of flânerie - the art of purposeful walking that reveals the city's hidden meanings and possibilities.

> "The sentiment of the city is as strong and perhaps even more entrancing than the sentiment of nature that romanticism sought to exalt."
> _Original: "Le sentiment de la ville est aussi fort et peut-être même plus envoûtant que le sentiment de la nature que le romantisme cherchait à exalter."_

**Quick Take**: Walking in cities isn't just transportation - it's a way of thinking and experiencing that reveals truths about urban life that other modes miss.

### Architecture as Political Statement
The book documents Paris's relationship with modern architecture, from the missed opportunities of the 1920s to the heavy-handed interventions of the 1960s and beyond. Bailly contrasts successful experiments like Beaubourg (which created genuine public space) with failures like the Bibliothèque Nationale François Mitterrand (which creates an inaccessible fortress). He mourns the destruction of working-class neighborhoods and traditional spaces like zinc counters and small bistros that facilitated democratic social interaction.

> "W.G. Sebald, at the end of Austerlitz, says all the evil he could think of this new National Library which not only made him regret that of the Rue de Richelieu but gave him the sensation of 'a place that repels you, that from the outset definitively goes against the needs of any true reader.'"
> _Original: "W.G. Sebald, à la fin de Austerlitz, dit tout le mal qu'il pense de cette nouvelle Bibliothèque nationale qui non seulement lui a fait regretter celle de la Rue de Richelieu mais lui a donné la sensation d'un 'lieu qui vous repousse, qui dès le début va à l'encontre des besoins de tout vrai lecteur.'"_

**Quick Take**: Architecture is never neutral - it either enables or restricts human connection, and the best urban design prioritizes permeability and surprise over monumentality.

### Nostalgia as Resistance
Bailly challenges the progressive taboo against nostalgia, arguing it's not about freezing time but maintaining consciousness of what has been lost and what could have been. In a city that has witnessed four revolutions in a century, nostalgia represents Paris's role as a place where people dared to dream of different ways of living together. The preservation of memory becomes an act of political resistance against forces that would erase Paris's radical traditions.

> "Nostalgia is nothing other than the consciousness of disappearance, that which meditates on it and takes it up again. Nostalgic we are, and it is the evidence, of what has been, but also of what could not be."
> _Original: "La nostalgie n'est rien d'autre que la conscience de la disparition, celle qui la médite et la reprend. Nostalgiques nous sommes, et c'est la preuve, de ce qui a été, mais aussi de ce qui n'a pas pu être."_

**Quick Take**: Remembering what cities used to be isn't sentimental - it's essential for imagining what they could become.

### The Persistence of the Everyday
Despite massive transformations, certain elements of Parisian life endure: markets that maintain forms of socialization, small restaurants and workshops, unexpected pockets of tranquility like the Allée des Cygnes, and the simple beauty of everyday urban encounters. These fragile survivals represent the city's resilience and its capacity to accommodate human desire and spontaneity within the constraints of history and economics.

> "Paris, with four revolutions in a century, is one of the cities in the world where it has been most dreamed of the possibility, the effectiveness of a world of human relations freed from old tutelages."
> _Original: "Paris, avec quatre révolutions en un siècle, est l'une des villes du monde où l'on a le plus rêvé la possibilité, l'efficacité d'un monde de relations humaines libéré des vieilles tutelles."_

**Quick Take**: Cities survive through the accumulated small acts and spaces that allow ordinary life to flourish, not through grand monuments.

## Best Quotes
- "The form of a city changes faster, alas! than the human heart" (Baudelaire, quoted throughout)
- "Paris then, within the limits of its twenty arrondissements, never slept entirely, and allowed debauchery to change neighborhoods three times each night. They had not yet chased and dispersed the inhabitants. A people remained, who had ten times barricaded their streets and put kings to flight." (Guy Debord)
  _Original: "Paris alors, dans les limites de ses vingt arrondissements, ne dormait jamais tout à fait, et permettait à la débauche de changer trois fois de quartier par nuit. On n'avait pas encore pourchassé et dispersé les habitants. Un peuple restait, qui avait dix fois barricadé ses rues et mis les rois en fuite."_
- "Between what has been paid to time and what has not had the good fortune to be able to, between what simply is no more and what could not exist, a relationship is established."
  _Original: "Entre ce qui a été payé au temps et ce qui n'a pas eu la chance de pouvoir, entre ce qui n'est tout simplement plus et ce qui n'a pas pu exister, un rapport s'établit."_
- "Paris, like an immense collective subject, for a long time, was that - a city that thought by itself."
  _Original: "Paris, comme un immense sujet collectif, a été, longtemps, cela - une ville qui pensait par elle-même."_

## Action Items
- **Walk your city purposefully**: Follow Bailly's example and explore urban spaces on foot, paying attention to how different neighborhoods feel and who uses them
- **Document disappearing places**: Notice what's being lost in urban transformations - not just buildings but ways of life and social patterns
- **Find the in-between spaces**: Seek out the non-monumental places where real urban life happens - markets, small shops, anonymous streets
- **Resist the purely scenic**: Experience cities as lived environments rather than tourist destinations, even when visiting
- **Support permeable architecture**: Advocate for urban design that welcomes rather than excludes, that creates public space rather than privatized zones

## Questions to Consider
- What elements of your city's character seem most threatened by current development patterns?
- How does the official narrative of your city differ from the experience of living there day to day?
- What spaces in your city enable democratic social interaction, and what forces threaten them?
- How can we distinguish between necessary urban evolution and destructive transformation?
- What role does nostalgia play in how we understand and advocate for our cities?

## Conclusion
"Paris quand même" is worth your time as both a love letter and a warning. Bailly captures the paradox at the heart of all great cities: they must evolve to remain vital, but evolution often means destruction of what made them special in the first place. The biggest reason to read this book is its beautifully articulated argument that cities are not just collections of buildings and infrastructure, but repositories of memory, desire, and possibility.

Bailly's particular genius lies in showing how Paris's resistance to complete homogenization offers hope for other cities facing similar pressures. While acknowledging his pessimism about many recent changes, he ultimately finds reasons for optimism in the city's stubborn refusal to be completely tamed or commodified. This isn't a book about preserving cities as museums, but about fighting for their capacity to surprise, accommodate desire, and enable alternative ways of living together.

In an era of accelerating urban change and increasing standardization of city life worldwide, Bailly reminds us that what makes cities precious is precisely their resistance to complete rationalization - the corners where spontaneity and memory still thrive against all odds. Paris survives, nevertheless, and its survival offers lessons for all cities struggling to maintain their souls amid the imperatives of growth and efficiency.
