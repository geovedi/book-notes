# The Bus from Mostar
**Original Title**: De bus uit Mostar
**Authors**: GerBen van 't Hek, Rens Lieman | **Year**: 2022 

## Summary
In May 1992, as war erupts in the former Yugoslavia, 26 young female handball players from Mostar, Bosnia-Herzegovina, flee their city on a desperate bus journey organized by their coach. Ranging from 12 to 22 years old, these athletes—representing Bosnia's diverse ethnic groups of Croats, Bosniaks, and Serbs—escape to the Netherlands expecting a brief stay. Instead, they become refugees for years, some never returning home. Based on extensive interviews with the players, their families, and Dutch host families, this powerful narrative reveals how sport transcended ethnic divisions and became a lifeline of normalcy amidst chaos.

This compelling account serves as both a tribute to resilience and a stark reminder of war's human cost. It's particularly valuable for readers interested in refugee experiences, the Balkan conflicts, or the unifying power of sports. You'll gain insight into how ordinary people survive extraordinary circumstances and how communities can bridge even the deepest divides.

## Core Insights

### The Fragility of Multicultural Harmony
Mostar was once Yugoslavia's model city—a true melting pot where Orthodox Serbs, Catholic Croats, and Muslim Bosniaks lived side by side, intermarried, and shared daily lives. Forty percent of marriages were mixed, religion rarely dictated relationships, and ethnic identity was something that existed "beneath the surface." The book illustrates through personal stories how quickly this harmony shattered when political forces exploited ethnic divisions for power.

> "Mostar is the most Yugoslavian place in Yugoslavia. Tito's dream: a peaceful melting pot of ethnicities."
> _Original: "Mostar is de meest Joegoslavische plek in Joegoslavië. Tito's droom: een vreedzame smeltkroes van etniciteiten."_

**Quick Take**: Even the most integrated societies can fracture when leaders prioritize division over unity.

### Sport as Sanctuary
For these young athletes, handbal became their refuge from trauma. While their hometown descended into ethnic violence and their families were forced to choose sides, the team remained united. The handball field was where normalcy prevailed—where a Serb, Croat, and Bosniak could still be teammates working toward a common goal. Their Dutch host families discovered that maintaining the team's training schedule was crucial for the girls' psychological wellbeing.

> "The handball field is their hiding place."
> _Original: "Het handbalveld is hun schuilplaats."_

**Quick Take**: Shared purpose and routine can provide essential stability during times of trauma.

### The Burden of Childhood Lost
The book heartbreakingly documents how war forces children into premature adulthood. Twelve-year-old girls who should be worrying about homework and crushes instead spend two months hiding in bunkers from grenades and snipers. They learn to distinguish between incoming and outgoing artillery, to recognize the sound of different weapons, to know which buildings offer the best protection.

> "These aren't children anymore. For two months, grenades have been falling in Mostar. On the way to the bakery, during handball practice, at school; at any moment of the day the air raid siren can sound."
> _Original: "Dit zijn geen kinderen meer. Al twee maanden lang vallen er bommen in Mostar. Onderweg naar de bakker, tijdens handbaltraining, op school; op elk moment van de dag kan het luchtalarm klinken."_

**Quick Take**: War steals not just lives but innocence, forcing children to develop survival skills no child should need.

### The Complexities of Refugee Integration
The Dutch host families who expected to house the girls for "a few weeks" found themselves parenting traumatized teenagers for years. The book explores the challenges of cultural adaptation, the guilt of parents who sent their children away to safety, and the complicated identity formation that occurs when you're too Bosnian for the Netherlands and too Dutch for Bosnia.

> "Weeks become months, months become years. Some girls never return to Mostar."
> _Original: "Weken worden maanden, maanden worden jaren. Sommige meisjes keren nooit meer terug naar Mostar."_

**Quick Take**: Refugee displacement creates lasting identity challenges that persist long after conflicts end.

### The Courage of Ordinary Heroes
Coach Joško Stanić and bus driver Safet risked their lives to transport these girls through sniper territory during a brief UN-brokered ceasefire. Their story demonstrates how moral courage often comes from unexpected places—neither was a professional rescuer, just men who saw a need and acted despite the personal danger.

> "If we go, we go together."
> _Original: "Als we gaan, gaan we samen."_

**Quick Take**: True heroism lies in ordinary people choosing to do extraordinary things for others.

## Questions to Consider

1. How might our own communities be vulnerable to the ethnic divisions that destroyed Mostar?
2. What role can sports and shared activities play in healing divided communities?
3. If you had to flee your home with only what you could carry, what would represent "home" to you?
4. How do we balance immediate humanitarian needs with long-term integration challenges?
5. What responsibility do host communities have in helping refugees maintain their cultural identity?

## Conclusion

This powerful narrative reminds us that behind every conflict statistic are individual stories of loss, courage, and resilience. The bus from Mostar carried more than 26 young athletes—it carried the hope that even when war destroys everything else, human connection and shared purpose can survive.

Is this worth your time? Absolutely. In an era of increasing displacement and divided communities, these young women's story offers both a warning about how quickly harmony can shatter and hope about how sport, courage, and human connection can help rebuild what's broken. The biggest reason to read it is to understand that refugee crises aren't political abstractions—they're collections of individual lives forever changed by forces beyond their control.

This book will leave you with a deeper appreciation for both the fragility of peace and the remarkable resilience of the human spirit. It's a testament to how ordinary people can find extraordinary strength when everything they've ever known is destroyed.
