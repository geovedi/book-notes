# Unrealistic Love: How to Find Your Person and Build Strong Relationships
**Original Title**: Нереальная любовь. Как найти своего человека и построить крепкие отношения
**Author**: Irina Semizorova | **Year**: 2022 | **Category**: Romance & Relationships

## Summary
This Russian self-help book challenges conventional wisdom about love and relationships, arguing that our unrealistic expectations—fueled by fairy tales, movies, and societal conditioning—prevent us from finding genuine connection. Semizorova, a family therapist, combines systemic psychology, Jungian archetypes, and practical exercises to help readers build themselves first before seeking relationships.

The book reveals that our childhood experiences, family patterns, and cultural myths create distorted views of love. Many people enter relationships not for genuine connection but to compensate for childhood wounds, prove something to others, or fulfill societal expectations. Through therapeutic case studies and practical exercises, the author guides readers toward understanding that real love requires self-awareness, healing past traumas, and accepting fundamental differences between men and women.

**This book is ideal for** people struggling with repeated relationship failures, those carrying childhood wounds into adult partnerships, and anyone ready to question romanticized notions of love. Readers will gain practical tools for understanding their relationship patterns, healing family dynamics, and building authentic connections based on reality rather than fantasy.

## Core Insights

### Love as the Fundamental Fabric of Life
The book opens with a radical premise: everything in life is made of love, even the most seemingly negative experiences. Drawing from systemic therapy founder Bert Hellinger's work that "everything in the world is made from love," Semizorova challenges readers to find the grain of love in every situation, even in seemingly harmful actions like a mother giving up her child to an orphanage.

> "Everything in the world is made from love. This book was conceived as a letter, as a message to our age of tension and anxiety."
> _Original: "Все на свете делается из любви. Эта книга была задумана мной как письмо, как послание в наш век напряжения и тревог."_

**Quick Take**: When we shift our focus from problems and stress to recognizing love's presence everywhere, we transform our experience of life and relationships.

### Understanding Fundamental Gender Differences
Semizorova explains that men and women operate from completely different consciousness systems. Male consciousness is linear and direct—when a man says "I love you," he means it at that point and doesn't understand why women need constant reassurance. Female consciousness is multi-layered and contextual, seeking hidden meanings and emotional nuance.

> "A man says Russian, with concrete, short sentences. There is no triple bottom, as with women."
> _Original: "Мужчина говорит русским языком, конкретными, короткими предложениями. У мужчин нет никакого тройного дна, как у женщин."_

**Quick Take**: Accepting these fundamental differences rather than trying to change your partner is the foundation of successful relationships.

### The Third Entity: Relationships as a Living Thing
Most people think relationships involve two people, but Semizorova introduces the concept of relationships as a third entity that both partners must nurture and serve. When couples operate as two separate individuals trying to get needs met, the relationship itself suffers. Successful couples understand they're co-creating something larger than themselves.

**Quick Take**: View your relationship as a living entity that requires care from both partners, not just a connection between two individuals.

### Healing Family Patterns and Ancestral Wounds
The book identifies several destructive patterns that prevent healthy relationships: having children "for yourself" without involving fathers, viewing men as merely sperm donors, carrying post-war generational trauma that devalues men, and using children as tools to "fix" broken relationships or make mothers feel "complete."

> "A child born for themselves, growing up in a female triangle where there isn't even the scent of a man, grows in a cocoon where there's no place for a man."
> _Original: "Девочка, рожденная для себя, взрослеющая в женском треугольнике, где нет даже запаха мужчины, растет в коконе, где мужчине место не отведено."_

**Quick Take**: Recognizing and healing these family patterns is essential before entering healthy relationships.

### The Four Male and Four Female Archetypes
Drawing on Carl Jung's work, Semizorova explains how understanding archetypal patterns can help us choose compatible partners and stop expecting one person to fulfill every need. The female archetypes are: Loving (giver), Queen (ruler), Warrior (independent), and Witch (transformer). Male archetypes are: Warrior (conqueror), King (provider), Magician (understander), and Lover (romantic).

**Quick Take**: Identify your archetype and understand your partner's rather than expecting one person to be everything to you.
