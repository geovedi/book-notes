"Power and Prediction" explores the transformative impact of artificial intelligence (AI) on various industries and decision-making processes. The authors emphasize the importance of understanding AI's primary function: prediction. AI excels at predicting outcomes based on data, which has profound implications for businesses and society.

The book introduces the concept of "prediction machines," which are AI systems designed to augment human decision-making by providing highly accurate predictions. These machines have the potential to revolutionize industries like healthcare and insurance, optimizing resource allocation and improving outcomes.

The authors stress that AI adoption should focus on developing system-level solutions rather than relying on point solutions. System-level thinking involves identifying key decisions within an organization and leveraging powerful prediction machines to optimize outcomes. This approach allows for the exploration of multiple alternative solutions and promotes innovation.

While AI has the potential to reduce discrimination and bias by offering objective decision-making benchmarks, it also raises ethical concerns. The book acknowledges the risk of AI inheriting human biases from training data but highlights the advantage of AI's scrutable nature, enabling easier detection and mitigation of discrimination compared to human decision-makers.

The authors present examples of AI applications, such as detecting bias in healthcare decisions and automating traffic enforcement, which have the potential to reduce discrimination and promote equal treatment. However, they acknowledge that resistance to AI adoption may come from those who benefit from existing biases.

"Power and Prediction" presents a balanced perspective on AI's capabilities, emphasizing the need for vigilance, thoughtful design, and continuous monitoring to ensure AI's positive impact on society. The book encourages businesses and policymakers to embrace AI as a tool for progress while addressing its potential risks responsibly.

## Success from Away?
In 2018, the authors published "Prediction Machines," delving into the economics of AI. They realized that while technology would continue to evolve, the underlying economics would remain a constant factor. The initial book primarily focused on the economics of point solutions in AI, where prediction played a central role. However, they discovered that an essential aspect of AI's impact had yet to be fully explored - the systems part.

The oversight in their previous work stemmed from their concentrated focus on prediction, which caused them to overlook the broader economic implications of building AI systems. In 2017, the authors had predicted that the first Canadian AI unicorn would emerge from cities like Montreal, Toronto, or Edmonton, backed by government funding and the presence of AI pioneers and global corporations. To their surprise, the first Canadian AI unicorn, Verafin, emerged from St. John's, Newfoundland. Verafin specialized in fraud detection and identity validation for financial institutions, highlighting the significance of embedded AI systems.

The narrow focus on prediction machines had, in a way, blinded experts to the broader potential of commercial AI deployments. To understand AI's true impact, the authors realized that they needed to consider both the economics of the technology and the systems in which it operates. This shift in perspective led them to study human cognition, social behavior, production systems, and industry structures in the context of AI adoption.

In their pursuit of understanding AI's adoption more comprehensively, the authors engaged with various stakeholders and conducted empirical research to build an economic framework. This framework aimed to encompass the adoption of AI, proposing a distinction between point solutions and system solutions. Point solutions involve simple AI tool replacements, while system solutions require the redesign of products, services, and organizations to fully harness the benefits of AI.

Recognizing a unique moment called "The Between Times," the authors described the period between the revelation of AI's power and its widespread adoption. During this time, companies and governments sought profitable pathways for AI adoption, with some industries embracing AI faster than others.

Armed with new insights and a comprehensive economic framework, the authors embarked on writing a new book focused on system solutions in AI adoption. This upcoming book aimed to explain how organizations could effectively embrace AI by redesigning their systems, leading to transformative changes in various sectors.

## The Between Times
### A Parable of Three Entrepreneurs

Electricity was a revolutionary force that transformed society, providing affordable lighting and powering consumer goods and factories. At the turn of the 20th century, only 3% of US households had access to electricity, and it took 40 years for half the population to adopt this groundbreaking technology. Similarly, AI finds itself in "The Between Times," the phase between demonstrating its capabilities and achieving widespread adoption.

To understand the future of AI, we can draw lessons from the historical pattern of electricity's adoption. In the 1880s, entrepreneurs promoting electricity had to emphasize its advantages over steam power, particularly its efficiency and reduced energy waste. They offered "point solutions," directly replacing steam power with electricity at specific entry points in factories or devices.

As the potential of electricity became clearer, entrepreneurs recognized the value of paying for power only when needed. They developed "application solutions," involving the redesign of machines to leverage individual electrical engines, enabling on-off functionality. Forward-thinking entrepreneurs went a step further and reimagined entire factories around electricity, creating "system solutions."

System solutions brought about transformative changes, optimizing spatial layouts, workflows, and decoupling machines from centralized power sources. This system-level innovation paved the way for increased productivity and efficiency in various industries.

Similarly, the future of AI lies in envisioning new designs for products, services, and factories, considering the decoupling of prediction from decision-making. While point solutions in AI offer limited value, application solutions that cater to specific needs can be differentiated and protected with intellectual property rights. However, the most significant potential lies in system solutions, where complex innovations can enable scalability and lead to a redistribution of economic power.

As AI systems continue to develop and be adopted, they will reshape industries and determine who gains power within them. Anticipating these shifts is crucial, as the true value of AI lies in system-level innovation, enabling the creation of vastly more productive and efficient systems beyond just reducing prediction costs. By learning from the parable of the three entrepreneurs - point, application, and system solutions - we can better understand the impact of different value propositions on technology adoption and leverage AI's potential for transformative change.

### AI's System Future

In 2017, a Toronto AI conference brought together economists and experts from various fields, showcasing both optimism and skepticism about AI's impact on economies and societies. Historical patterns of technology adoption demonstrate that initial enthusiasm for transformative technologies, such as electricity and computers, can coexist with disappointment in their immediate productivity impact. Currently, AI finds itself in "The Between Times," exploring point and application solutions, but the true transformation lies in system solutions.

Point solutions in AI involve using predictive analytics as a tool to enhance existing processes, offering modest productivity gains. Application solutions, on the other hand, involve specific AI applications with limited scale and impact. The true potential of AI will be unleashed with system solutions, integrating AI predictions into decision-making processes. However, this entails not only technical challenges but also organizational and strategic adjustments to fully leverage AI's potential.

The impact of AI will be felt when better decisions are made, enabling humans to perform tasks more efficiently and effectively. Presently, only a small percentage of companies have achieved significant financial benefits from AI, while others struggle to integrate it into their existing systems. The book aims to explore and explain how to identify aspects of the system that will lead to successful AI system solutions.

The most significant increase in AI adoption is expected to come from changes in systems, which will be disruptive. Disruptive system changes alter the roles of people and companies within industries, leading to shifts in power and creating economic winners and losers. For instance, AI-driven predictions in farming are changing how decisions are made, potentially centralizing farm management and reshaping the role of farmers as landowners.

The book's purpose is to motivate the development of AI system solutions that go beyond point and application solutions. Part 1 sets the context and challenges in developing such solutions, drawing parallels with past transformative technologies like electricity. Part 2 explores the decision-making process, the cognitive costs of decision-making, and how AI prediction can shift decision-making from rules to decisions.

Part 3 delves into creating new systems, emphasizing the value of adopting a system mindset and understanding decision relationships. Part 4 examines the implications of systemwide change for power dynamics in industries and how AI-driven predictions can affect economic power accumulation. Part 5 explores AI's potential to disrupt industries by decoupling prediction and judgment, potentially leading to centralized decision-making and a concentration of power.

In Part 6, the focus is on system design, providing a tool to map businesses or industries as systems of decisions when utilizing powerful prediction machines. The book concludes by emphasizing that AI-driven industry transformation takes time, involving experimentation, imitation, and eventual winners and losers in the process.

### AI Is Prediction Technology

The first book, "Prediction Machines," simplified the economics of AI by focusing on prediction as its essence. Despite popular culture's portrayal of AI as intelligent machines with agency, the reality is that it represents a breakthrough in statistical techniques, significantly reducing the cost of prediction. Notably, deep learning, demonstrated in 2012, revolutionized image recognition by framing it as a prediction problem and surpassing human classifiers.

Prediction machines are valuable because predictions serve as a crucial input into decision-making. However, they are not the only input; judgment and data also play essential roles in the decision-making process. Judgment involves determining the reward of a particular action in a specific environment and can be influenced by bias or varying beliefs. Data quality is crucial for effective prediction; predictions are most accurate when made on the basis of relevant and supportive data.

Causal inference, a branch of statistics, complements AI by discovering causal relationships and providing data necessary for accurate predictions. Although AI excels in games and controlled settings, it may encounter challenges when adversaries can undermine predictions or competitors exploit vulnerabilities.

Point solutions using AI work well when predictions are supported by available data, but system-level changes may be necessary when predictions lack support or when causal inference issues arise. For example, AI applications in financial transactions influence approval decisions based on fraud predictions, balancing trade-offs between avoiding mistakes and transaction convenience.

As economists studying AI, the authors aim to cut through the hype and emphasize the importance of prediction, judgment, and data in AI applications. AI attracts interest from various fields, but at its core, it represents an advancement in statistics, specifically the statistics of prediction.

While AI applications, such as fraud detection in banking and financial services, have benefited companies like Verafin, most businesses face challenges in adopting AI due to the need for system-level changes rather than simple point solutions.

The "Ship-then-shop" thought experiment for Amazon illustrates the need for system solutions in AI adoption. While AI has made strides in addressing low-hanging fruit, significant opportunities lie ahead as the technology is just getting started.

To take advantage of AI prediction, businesses must carefully consider its purpose and navigate existing decision-making processes that have evolved without AI. AI predictions are correlations, not causations, and causal relationships require data from randomized experiments.

While point solutions offer improvements in existing systems, system solutions may necessitate significant changes and present challenges to be economically viable.

"The Between Times" represents the stage where AI is just beginning to unfold its potential, and businesses must carefully consider how to effectively integrate it.

The book provides a toolkit to identify non-obvious but significant opportunities for AI prediction and addresses the barriers to AI adoption.

## Rules
### To Decide or Not to Decide

Economists recognize that the perfectly rational agent depicted in models is not a realistic representation of real people. In reality, individuals often avoid making decisions to reduce cognitive load, leading to the adoption of default rules or routines. AI prediction becomes valuable when making decisions, but it may pose challenges to existing systems heavily reliant on rules and routines.

The decision-making process is influenced by various factors, including the consequences of choices and the cost of information. Decisions with low consequences and high cognitive load often result in default rules rather than active decision-making. To simplify the decision-making process and reduce complexity, people tend to limit their choices.

Costly information can also lead to default rules, as the effort of obtaining and processing the information may outweigh the benefits gained from making the decision. Decision tree analysis illustrates how individuals make choices based on available information and predicted outcomes.

AI prediction has the potential to transform latent decisions (default rules) into actual decisions with significant implications for organizations. The book aims to explore how AI can reshape decision-making processes and how organizations may need to adapt in response.

Throughout the book, judgment is a critical concept that will be examined, as it plays a central role in decision-making. AI's ability to separate prediction from judgment allows decision-makers to focus solely on making decisions.

Decision-making is influenced by the consequences of choices and the cost of obtaining information. Rules, as preemptive decisions, are often developed by individuals and organizations to avoid the cognitive effort of considering information repeatedly in similar situations.

AI prediction becomes valuable when it provides superior information for decision-making, encouraging individuals to break their rules and make actual decisions. Examples of "forced experimentation" during events like Covid-19 lockdowns and strikes demonstrate untapped benefits to decision-making.

Organizations frequently invest in not deciding by developing rules and standard operating procedures (SOPs) to enhance reliability and reduce cognitive load. However, AI prediction challenges organizations heavily reliant on rules, as the true value of AI lies in enhancing decision-making rather than rule-following.

The introduction of AI can unlock hidden decisions and replace existing rules with new, more informed decisions. The trade-off between rules and decision-making becomes critical in the context of AI, as AI lowers the cost of information (prediction) and increases the value of decision-making.

By providing accurate predictions and reducing the cost of information, AI enables better decision-making. Rules, although simplifying decision-making, may not be optimal in every situation. Organizations that heavily rely on standard operating procedures (SOPs) may face challenges with AI adoption, requiring a reevaluation of their decision-making processes.

AI has the potential to unlock hidden decisions and replace old rules with new, more informed decisions, transforming how decisions are made in organizations.

### Hidden Uncertainty

Airports are adopting a novel approach to terminal design, reimagining them as destinations where passengers can spend additional time and money. With increased uncertainty in air travel and security measures, passengers now find themselves spending up to an hour longer in airports. However, navigational apps and AI prediction are stepping in to reduce this uncertainty, providing passengers with more accurate travel time estimates and empowering them to make informed decisions about when to leave for the airport. Moreover, AI prediction is proving useful in estimating security line wait times, further reducing uncertainty and enhancing passenger experiences.

The shift towards non-aeronautical charges in airport revenues highlights the growing significance of in-terminal activities. To tackle what is known as "hidden uncertainty," people often adopt rules to sidestep the cognitive costs associated with decision-making. This tendency leads to overengineered solutions across various industries as investments are made to safeguard against uncertainty. For instance, greenhouses face uncertainty concerning weather and pest infestations, which drives farmers to adopt rules to minimize risks.

AI is now stepping in to improve pest management in greenhouses, providing farmers with AI-driven predictions that enable more informed decisions and potentially paving the way for system-level changes. By replacing existing rules, AI predictions have the potential to bring about more efficient operations and unlock new possibilities across different industries.

In airports, AI-driven navigational apps and security line predictions are creating better passenger experiences, reducing uncertainty and streamlining travel processes. Likewise, greenhouses are reaping the benefits of AI predictions for pest management, empowering farmers to ease reliance on existing rules and explore new strategies.

The transformative power of AI predictions is evident in how it is revolutionizing decision-making in both airports and greenhouses. By diminishing uncertainty and enabling more informed choices, AI is not only enhancing existing systems but also paving the way for flexible decision-making across various industries, leading to improved efficiency and novel opportunities.

### Rules Are Glue

Atul Gawande's book "The Checklist Manifesto" underscores the significance of checklists in managing complexity in fields like medicine and aviation. Checklists and standard operating procedures (SOPs) are tangible manifestations of rules designed to ensure reliability and minimize errors in intricate systems. AI prediction presents exciting opportunities to transform rules into decisions, thereby enhancing productivity and efficiency across various industries.

Personalization holds paramount importance in marketing and education to cater to individual differences and specific needs. Pandora's research demonstrates how AI predictions can personalize the number of ads, resulting in increased profits. Implementing AI predictions might necessitate process and strategy changes, but the potential benefits make it a worthwhile pursuit.

Education is rife with rules and standards, and there lies a tension between adhering to rules and accommodating flexibility in personalized learning. AI in education has the potential to deliver personalized training at scale, particularly benefiting entrepreneurs in developing countries.

AI-driven entrepreneurship training programs have already demonstrated the power of personalized modules tailored to individual sellers' operations and products. By enabling informed decisions on which entrepreneurs receive which training, AI contributed to a significant 6.6 percent increase in revenue for businesses using the program.

AI excels at adding value at scale by replacing rigid rules with personalized decisions in diverse systems. For example, while advertising-supported media relies on strict rules for content lengths and ad placements, platforms like YouTube utilize AI to personalize content recommendations and ad placements, thereby enhancing value for both users and advertisers.

In the education system, rules such as age-based curricula and fixed teacher assignments can hinder the impact of AI-driven personalized learning. However, in a new system designed to leverage personalized content, pacing, and teacher support, AI-driven personalized education could have a more substantial impact, moving away from the constraints of age-based curriculum rules.

Unleashing the full potential of AI-driven decisions requires untangling rules in various systems. By personalizing entrepreneurship training and content recommendations, AI can add value at scale. However, rules in existing systems may impede the impact of AI-driven decisions, making it crucial to navigate and unlock these rules for maximum benefits.

The integration of AI into new systems designed around personalized decision-making, rather than rigid rules, empowers AI to be more potent and transformative. In conclusion, AI prediction holds immense promise for enhancing productivity and personalization across industries, given the ability to adapt and rethink existing rules to fully leverage AI's potential.

## Systems
### Glued versus Oiled Systems

AI had the potential to play a significant role in managing the Covid-19 pandemic by providing predictions and decision-making capabilities under conditions of uncertainty. However, traditional public health procedures primarily relied on rigid rules rather than AI-driven decisions, leading to widespread lockdowns and economic disruptions.

The core prediction challenge during a pandemic is identifying infectious individuals to enable targeted isolation and protective measures. To address this, various prediction tools, including rapid antigen tests and AI-based models, were developed to detect infections and assess infectiousness.

A select group of large companies came together to create an innovation platform aimed at overcoming rule-based barriers and facilitating decision-making under uncertainty. By integrating prediction tools into a well-functioning system, workplaces could have reopened safely, minimizing Covid-19 cases and disruptions.

Rules often introduce inefficiencies, and AI predictions offer the potential to unlock new opportunities for decision-making in various systems. However, effectively utilizing AI prediction and turning rules into decisions require uncovering uncertainties and adapting dependent procedures within the system.

AI prediction could have significantly assisted in managing the pandemic if successfully integrated into a well-functioning system. Covid-19 was not solely a health problem but also an information problem due to the lack of accurate infection predictions. Rapid antigen tests and AI-based models provided solutions to address this information gap during the pandemic.

The process of turning rules into decisions requires a well-coordinated system, and starting with new organizations might be more effective than adapting existing ones. AI predictions have the capacity to enable targeted and efficient decision-making, reducing reliance on rigid rules and maximizing value creation.

### The System Mindset

At Bletchley Park, annual contests challenge participants to compete against computer programs in the Turing test, where they attempt to convince their counterparts that they are human. Similarly, horse races between humans and AI are common in AI research, but full-scale replacement of humans by machines remains limited so far.

When analyzing AI's potential impact on jobs, economists break down occupations into tasks and assess their vulnerability to automation. However, leading technology companies like Amazon, Google, Facebook, and Netflix approach AI adoption at the system level, opting to integrate AI into their operations rather than replacing tasks one by one.

While economists often focus on cost, businesses find the value proposition of AI more compelling. AI adoption is more likely when it enhances value creation opportunities rather than solely focusing on cost savings. However, implementing system-wide changes is challenging, requiring the replacement of existing systems with new ones that offer novel value creation possibilities.

In the field of medicine, AI applications include disease diagnosis, automated surgery, at-home patient monitoring, personalized treatments, and drug discovery and repurposing. Despite the prevalence of AI contests and task-level comparisons in AI research, full-scale replacement of humans by machines is not always the primary outcome.

Examining AI's potential solely based on tasks may overlook the value of system-wide changes facilitated by AI technologies. Emphasizing the system mindset acknowledges the larger potential of AI and recognizes that value creation necessitates reconstituting systems of decisions, incorporating both machine prediction and human input.

Eric Topol's book, "Deep Medicine," explores AI's potential impact on health care and the competition between AIs and doctors for diagnosis. While Topol's book highlights the importance of understanding AI and health care systems, it may not fully consider human behavior and incentives, which are crucial in AI adoption in health care.

Factors such as doctors' compensation and fee-for-service reimbursement can impact their incentive to adopt AI technologies in the existing health-care system. The complexity and interdependence of decisions within the health-care system make AI point solutions challenging to implement effectively.

To leverage AI fully in health care, a new system with new incentives, training, methodologies, and culture is needed for doctors to effectively utilize AI. Health care currently ranks low in AI adoption across industries due to the difficulty of implementing AI point solutions within the existing system.

For AI to enable personalized treatments and remote patient monitoring in health care, system-wide changes are required. Such changes would involve adjustments to medical education, regulations, and the roles of different healthcare professionals.

Global health systems, especially in remote areas, could benefit from AI-enabled diagnosis and treatment, but scalable and sustainable improvements necessitate system-level changes.

While task-level thinking dominates AI adoption, a system mindset is required for transformative AI implementation. By examining entire systems, organizations can better understand how AI can facilitate positive changes and realize greater opportunities for AI adoption.

### The Greatest System of All

AlphaFold, an AI-based system, has emerged as a revolutionary tool for predicting protein structures, which plays a crucial role in understanding the building blocks of life and advancing medical research. Its potential impact on medicine, research, and bioengineering lies in its ability to streamline and accelerate the process of predicting protein structures from amino-acid sequences.

Innovation and invention represent areas where AI adoption holds the most potential to transform the economy. Practitioners recognize the need for a systems mindset in AI adoption, acknowledging that AI can change the process of innovation by enabling better data-driven predictions and generating thousands of possible hypotheses for research and development.

For instance, AI-driven recommendation engines on platforms like Amazon and Spotify can create a new system of innovation by significantly improving hypothesis development and experimentation. The impact of AI on innovation may even surpass that of previous general-purpose technologies like the steam engine and the internet.

AI's role in innovation extends to predicting the consequences of new combinations, automating hypothesis generation, and enhancing overall productivity. However, to fully benefit from AI in innovation, the entire innovation system must be reconsidered and adapted.

AI's potential to transform the drug development pipeline is particularly noteworthy, as it can predict protein structures and improve the prioritization of innovations. Nevertheless, recognizing the need for system-level change in various sectors can be challenging, and large companies may be hesitant to invest in transforming their existing, profitable industries.

It is essential to consider that technological changes driven by AI can lead to disruption in industries. Startups and smaller firms may innovate where larger incumbents do not, leading to the eventual collapse of incumbents and the emergence of new business models.

AI, particularly exemplified by AlphaFold, has the potential to revolutionize medical research and bioengineering through its accurate protein structure predictions. The impact of AI on innovation is significant, offering more efficient hypothesis generation and the possibility of breakthrough discoveries. To fully harness the benefits of AI in innovation, a systems mindset and a willingness to transform existing industries for long-term gains are essential.

## Power
### Disruption and Power

AI holds the transformative potential, but its real adoption and transformation come when new systems are created based on the technology's predictions and improved decision-making. While point solutions and applications are the initial outcomes of AI, true transformation necessitates a system mindset that replaces existing rules with new decisions.

Disruption is a common outcome of AI adoption, driven by the discovery of hidden opportunities, challenges in dismantling old systems, and shifts in economic power. As demonstrated in the electricity industry, improved prediction capabilities can lead to system innovation and decentralization, disrupting existing vertically integrated structures.

In this process, disruption can shift economic power from traditional incumbents to new entrants who recognize opportunities that incumbents overlook. One significant challenge is the occurrence of blind spots when radical technological changes improve performance on non-traditional metrics, leading incumbents to miss the need for organizational change.

Managing disruption in AI adoption involves reformulating business organization and priorities, not merely targeting different customer segments. Failure to adapt and embrace system innovation can lead to being disrupted, as illustrated by the case of the British army's resistance to adopting tanks in World War I.

AI's transformative potential requires the adoption of a system mindset and organizational change. Disruption in AI adoption can lead to shifts in economic power and create opportunities for new entrants. However, incumbents' blind spots may hinder their recognition of the need for change when AI improves performance on non-traditional metrics.

Successfully managing disruption entails rethinking business organization and priorities to embrace system-level innovation. Historical examples, such as Blockbuster's failure to adapt to Netflix's model, highlight how incumbents can struggle to adopt new technologies that require organizational change.

Organizational redesign, prompted by system-level change driven by AI, invariably involves changes in the value and power of suppliers of different resources within the organization, leading to resistance from those expecting to lose power. This resistance can impede the full realization of system-level solutions and create disruption.

Moreover, incumbents may struggle to adopt system-level solutions due to resistance to organizational change and fear of losing power. Such changes can lead to shifts in power at different levels, from industries to companies and even job levels.

Resisting system-level change can result in missed opportunities and disruption, as seen in the case of Blockbuster and Netflix. Conversely, successful implementation of system-level change driven by AI can lead to significant payoffs and benefits for those willing to embrace innovation.

### Do Machines Have Power?

The headlines and fears surrounding AI in the workplace often suggest that machines are taking over decision-making about employment. However, the reality is that machines and AI do not have power; humans ultimately make the decisions. AI can certainly automate decision-making processes, but humans are responsible for the judgment elements and defining the rules that guide AI's actions.

While the implementation of decisions can become fully automated, the decision-making process still involves human input. A prime example of this can be seen in the case of Ada, a customer service automation startup. Human judgment plays a crucial role in determining when to automate interactions with customers. AI's ability to predict customer intent opens opportunities for automation, but the threshold for automation is determined by human judgment based on the stakes involved.

Addressing concerns about machines controlling information, the feedback and interactions from users influence AI's predictions, indicating a two-way relationship. Machines and AI do not have the power to dictate outcomes; instead, they serve as tools that require human judgment to make effective decisions.

The "I'm Feeling Lucky" button on Google's search page exemplifies the challenge of automating decisions perfectly. AI predictions work well in narrow contexts and goals, but human judgment is essential for exceptional situations where the rules might not fully apply.

In AI systems, the responsibility for judgment lies with the humans who define the rules and criteria used by the machines. Codifying judgment into machines grants individuals extraordinary scale and power, necessitating accountability and clear identification of decision-makers.

The accumulation of power to AI adopters and the potential for shifting judgment from decision locations are important considerations. AI can create power through scale and reallocate power by changing whose judgment is used for decision-making.

AI predictions require human judgment to make decisions effectively. While AI can be valuable in specific contexts, it still relies on human input and collaboration to address exceptional situations. The responsibility for judgment in AI systems lies with humans who define the rules, and the power that AI grants to individuals requires careful consideration of accountability and decision-making authority.

### Accumulating Power

First-mover advantage in AI stems from the ability to deploy AI early, enabling faster learning and improvement. This advantage is further enhanced by the flywheel effect, as AI learns from data, leading to better prediction accuracy, a more effective system, and a competitive edge. BenchSci, an AI-in-medicine company, exemplifies the power of AI in reducing drug development time and costs by providing better insights from scientific research.

The business of prediction relies on obtaining better algorithms and data, with training data and feedback data playing crucial roles in AI learning. Feedback data is continuously collected to update AI models and maintain accuracy in dynamic environments. Competing effectively in the AI industry requires a sound data strategy, and first-movers may gain an advantage by attracting more users and generating more valuable feedback data.

The minimum efficient scale in AI depends on the accuracy required for predictions to be commercially viable in the market. While there are decreasing returns to scale in data, early entrants can gain a sustained advantage by effectively harnessing feedback data and investing in hardware and talent. These early movers have the opportunity to establish long-term market power and secure a large prize, making it challenging for new players to enter the market and catch up.

The flywheel effect in AI contributes to better prediction accuracy and a competitive advantage. Early deployment of AI allows for valuable data collection, leading to better predictions through feedback loops and creating a barrier to entry for competitors. A fast feedback loop accelerates an early lead and can result in a sustained competitive advantage over time, as demonstrated in the case of Microsoft's Bing search engine struggling to catch up with Google due to Google's faster feedback loop, resulting in constant learning and improved predictions.

In the AI industry, differentiation can occur based on quality, leading to higher demand for higher-quality predictions. The software-based nature of AI levels the cost of producing high-quality predictions with that of producing low-quality ones, giving an advantage to higher quality. Feedback loops are deliberately built to collect outcome data, enhancing an AI's learning process. By designing AI systems with access to outcome data, companies can lead to better learning and improved prediction accuracy.

Early movers in AI have a real advantage due to feedback loops, leading to a race to deploy AI at scale. Additionally, companies that differentiate their AI for specific contexts and purposes can create a defensible space in the market. Quality becomes a significant differentiator in the AI industry, as the cost of producing high-quality predictions is the same as producing low-quality ones, making high-quality AI more attractive to customers.

The first-mover advantage in AI is driven by the early deployment of AI, leading to faster learning, improvement, and a competitive edge. The ability to harness feedback data and differentiate AI for specific purposes further strengthens this advantage, making it challenging for newcomers to catch up and compete effectively in the market.

## How AI Disrupts
### A Great Decoupling

The common response "It will provide insights" to the question of what AI will do for customers is flawed. AI's true value lies in its ability to improve decision-making, not just provide insights. This is evident from the increase in decision-making jobs from 5% in 1960 to over 30% in 2015, highlighting the growing importance of decision-making skills in various fields.

AI prediction has the potential to enhance decision-making skills by translating insights into better decisions. Judgment plays a crucial role in decision-making, involving the assessment of the intensity of outcomes and payoffs. This is exemplified by the hypothetical decision-making scenario presented to Michael Jordan and Jerry Reinsdorf, demonstrating the importance of judgment in decisions.

AI prediction can decouple from human judgment, creating opportunities for better decision-making. Once AI provides predictions, the individuals or committees with the best judgment can make the final decision. The concept of revealed preference allows us to understand judgment from decisions made by individuals.

Amazon's use of AI in estimating consumer demand and pricing products illustrates the power of decoupling prediction and judgment. This decoupling opens up new possibilities for system designs that take advantage of better, faster, and cheaper predictions, combined with improved judgment skills.

In the realm of AI-driven decision-making, it is essential to focus on understanding and improving judgment skills for optimal outcomes. The true value of AI lies in its potential to enhance decision-making processes, going beyond providing mere insights.

AI's value proposition is in improving decision-making, with judgment playing a crucial role. By decoupling prediction from human judgment, AI offers new opportunities for system design and better outcomes. Understanding and enhancing judgment skills are critical components in leveraging AI for optimal decision-making.

### Thinking Probabilistically

In 2018, a tragic incident occurred when an Uber self-driving vehicle struck and killed a pedestrian in Tempe, Arizona, raising questions about the role of judgment in AI-driven decisions. The incident sparked conflicting explanations, with some claiming the car failed to see the pedestrian, while others argued it was difficult to avoid the collision. This incident highlights the importance of distinguishing between a bad decision and a bad outcome. Sometimes, good decisions may lead to bad outcomes due to factors beyond control.

Annie Duke's book, "Thinking in Bets," emphasizes the significance of recognizing uncertainty and understanding that outcomes are influenced by both luck and skill. This insight is particularly relevant in AI-driven decisions, where predictions can be uncertain, and judgments need to consider relative risk and potential consequences.

In self-driving cars, the role of prediction and judgment used to rest with the driver, making it challenging to assess decision errors in case of accidents. Embracing uncertainty becomes crucial in such AI-driven decisions. It becomes essential to acknowledge prediction uncertainty, as it can lead to more informed and fair decisions, as seen in areas like refugee claim assessments.

However, the lack of existing judgment for new AI applications can hinder their adoption and investment, leading to a chicken-and-egg problem. Building judgment can be achieved through planned learning from others and experience, and low-cost predictions can aid in this process. Nevertheless, when predictions require significant investment, a clear justification is needed to balance the costs involved.

In various contexts, the distinction between bad decisions and bad outcomes is essential to understanding the role of judgment in AI-driven decisions. "Thinking in Bets" stresses the importance of embracing uncertainty and recognizing the influence of luck and skill in outcomes, making it a valuable mindset for AI decision-making.

Decoupling prediction and judgment in AI systems can lead to better decision-making and fairer outcomes. For example, credit card fraud detection involves using judgment to decide how to react to prediction scores indicating potential fraud, choosing the right threshold to balance the risk of allowing fraudulent transactions and declining legitimate ones.

Building judgment can be complex and may involve considering various dimensions, which can serve as a barrier to adopting AI systems. However, it remains essential for better decision-making. The experience journey, where choices guide experiences, can complicate the development of judgment, but it is a crucial aspect to consider in AI implementation.

In certain domains transitioning from deterministic to probabilistic systems, regulatory approaches, similar to the FDA's role in pharmaceuticals, might be necessary. This can ensure proper guidelines and safeguards for the use of probabilistic AI systems.

As AI systems decouple prediction and judgment, choosing the right judges becomes crucial, considering their planning skills, experience, or opportunities for gaining experience. AI introduces probabilistic thinking into systems, transforming them from deterministic to probabilistic and creating opportunities for system redesign.

Fully exploiting the power of AI will require newly designed system-level solutions, including a regulatory function to assure society during this transition. Prethinking and planning for different scenarios become necessary to make informed decisions with AI predictions. Ultimately, AI's potential impact on decision-making requires careful consideration of judgment and its integration into AI systems to achieve optimal outcomes.

### The New Judges

Lead is a deadly neurotoxin that impacts brain development, leading to its phased-out use in paint and gasoline to improve public health. However, in Flint, Michigan, lead drinking water pipes continued to cause harm. To address this, a prediction machine was deployed to identify likely lead pipes. The machine correctly identified these pipes 80% of the time, prompting the replacement of thousands of them. However, political judgment hindered the adoption of predictions, leading to disparities in pipe replacements and stalling the process.

Eventually, a court settlement mandated the use of predictions, removing political discretion and increasing the success rate to 70%. This case highlights how AI prediction can create a struggle for decision-making power, leading to changes in decision rights and the allocation of power within organizations. The decoupling of prediction and judgment can change who is best suited to make decisions, impacting power dynamics.

The availability of prediction machines raises questions about the value of human judgment in decision-making. AI may either reinforce the talent of current decision-makers or reallocate decision-making power to others based on judgment efficiency. Changing the decision-maker can lead to resistance and skepticism but can also result in more effective decision-making in certain cases.

Lead phasing out led to improved public health, except for lead drinking water pipes in Flint. The prediction machine identified likely lead pipes, but political judgment hindered its initial adoption. The court settlement forced the use of predictions, increasing the success rate of identifying lead pipes. AI prediction can have significant effects on the power dynamics by reallocating decision-making authority, depending on the industry and situation.

In meteorology, operational meteorologists use forecasts to ensure people make good decisions during extreme weather events. The role of meteorologists has expanded to include the entire value chain, from forecast production to effective decision-making. AI in meteorology raises the challenge of learning to make decisions based on nearly perfect weather forecasts. Improved weather forecasts allow for better communication of weather event likelihood and severity, shifting the focus of meteorologists' work.

AI can enable personalized weather warnings based on individual behavior and risk profiles. With better AI predictions, the source of judgment can change, where local judgment is valued for specific contexts, and global judgment is valuable for consistent decision processes. However, AI may change who provides judgment, leading to resistance from affected decision-makers. The implementation of AI can either centralize or decentralize power in decision-making, depending on the system design.

The concentration of power may occur if judgment is codifiable and scalable through AI, as seen in credit card networks and radiology. In new system designs, reallocating decision rights based on information, skills, incentives, and coordination is essential to ensure decision efficiency. AI prediction has the potential to revolutionize decision-making processes across various industries, and understanding its implications for judgment and power dynamics is crucial for successful implementation.

## Envisaging New Systems
### Designing Reliable Systems

Thomas Schelling's thought experiment highlights the importance of reliable common knowledge in coordinating decisions. However, AI can create a bullwhip effect, where improved prediction in one decision harms others in the system. To address this, two main system design approaches are coordination and modularity.

Coordination involves aligning decisions across multiple decision-makers to manage variability and adjustment. It proves valuable in synchronization problems and assignment problems, where decisions need to be coordinated to achieve overall efficiency. On the other hand, modularity involves creating a wall around AI-driven decisions to shield them from reduced reliability and coordination costs. This approach is beneficial in complex situations where smaller elements can be fit together, making the system more scalable and resilient. Modularity also enables innovation without disrupting the rest of the system.

For instance, restaurants can benefit from modularity if their suppliers have their own modular system to handle variations in demand, counteracting the AI bullwhip effect. Scalability can be achieved by implementing modularity across the supply chain.

Modularity can address difficulties arising from interrelated decisions in AI adoption, making it easier when decisions do not have to align with others in the system. However, finding the right balance between coordination and modularity is crucial for successful AI implementation.

Amazon's supply chain coordination and recommendations exemplify the need for careful design in AI implementation. The example of Team New Zealand's AI sailor showcases how AI can speed up the innovation process and improve coordination between boat design and sailing maneuvers.

Digital twins, virtual representations of physical systems, combined with AI, offer risk-free playgrounds for innovation and facilitate iterative system development. Simulation allows the exploration of numerous options and enhances the chances of finding better combinations of decisions. Virtual Singapore and a wind farm's digital twin demonstrate the benefits of simulated systems, including prediction, optimization, and coordination of decisions.

Coordination and modularity are two main system design approaches to address the reduced reliability caused by AI-based decision-making. Decisions in a system are interdependent and influenced by other decisions or actions, making reliability crucial for system performance. Coordination aligns decision-makers' incentives and information flow to optimize the overall goal, while modularity creates a shield for AI-driven decisions, maintaining scalability and resilience. Simulation with digital twins allows for risk-free exploration of different decision combinations and AI predictions to find optimal solutions in complex systems.

### The Blank Slate

Insurance firms are heavily investing in data science to predict customer risk and set insurance premiums accordingly. However, surprisingly, they rarely share these risk predictions with customers, missing an opportunity to help customers reduce their risk. AI has the potential to generate high-fidelity risk predictions across various insurance sectors, such as home insurance and car insurance, providing valuable insights to customers.

Despite the potential benefits, few insurance companies have fully embraced this approach. Instead, they tend to focus on using AI solutions for traditional underwriting predictions. To facilitate system-level innovation and evaluate AI's value, a "blank slate" approach is introduced, using the AI Systems Discovery Canvas. This canvas helps identify core decisions needed to achieve an organization's mission and how AI predictions can impact those decisions.

Insurance companies can benefit from AI-driven predictions in marketing, underwriting, and claims decisions. AI can identify lower-risk customers for targeted marketing, enabling better underwriting decisions, and enhancing claims decision-making while reducing fraud, ultimately leading to increased profitability.

AI-driven insights have the potential to transform the insurance industry, but there may be challenges due to existing business models and regulations. Regulatory constraints in different jurisdictions limit the use of AI for risk profiling. However, AI is recognized for its value in underwriting and marketing decisions.

AI applications like automated claims assessment and risk monitoring align with specific departments, but their adoption may impact other decisions within the organization. Behavioral monitoring through AI allows for more precise risk assessment, enabling personalized insurance products. Customization and automation can provide a more competitive advantage for insurtech companies but also create conflicts within established insurers.

Customized insurance products may require organizational change, potentially leading to the removal of underwriters and salespeople from the process. This can result in resistance from established insurers due to uncertainty and power dynamics within the organization. Embracing AI's potential requires adopting new systems that optimize risk mitigation and customer-centric approaches.

The AI Systems Discovery Canvas aids in understanding the impact of AI on the insurance industry and identifies new business opportunities. By leveraging AI-driven predictions and integrating them into the decision-making process, insurance companies can enhance their offerings and better serve their customers while navigating regulatory constraints and organizational challenges.

### Anticipating System Change

AI has the potential to aid doctors in predicting whether a patient is having a heart attack, facilitating better decision-making regarding the need for testing and treatment. Since heart attack tests are expensive, invasive, and carry risks, the decision process for physicians is complex. However, an AI algorithm developed by economists has demonstrated higher accuracy than doctors in predicting heart attacks, reducing both overtesting and undertesting.

Implementing AI as a point solution can incrementally improve patient outcomes with minimal disruption to existing workflows. However, AI application solutions, where AI determines whether to test, remove doctors from the decision-making process and may require a larger system change. The decision alignment between doctors and administrators can significantly impact the adoption of AI tools and necessitate a reimagining of the emergency medicine system.

By leveraging AI predictions, emergency medicine has the potential to move diagnosis out of the hospital's triage space and into the patient's home, thereby improving patient care and resource allocation. AI predictions can revolutionize emergency medicine by aiding in the diagnosis and treatment decisions for patients arriving at the emergency department. This could lead to specialized training for paramedics in specific medical conditions, with AI assisting in sending the appropriately trained paramedic and required equipment to the scene.

The integration of AI predictions could potentially result in most patients being treated at home with specialized equipment brought by paramedics, reducing the need for hospital visits and improving patient outcomes. However, there are challenges in implementing such a system, including the need for highly accurate AI predictions, potential resistance from medical professionals and administrators, and significant system-wide changes.

To understand and evaluate potential AI adoption scenarios, especially when the benefits cross multiple divisions or require system-level changes, the AI System Discovery Canvas offers a valuable framework. While AI adoption in healthcare may take time and require disruption, the potential benefits of system-level changes could be significant, leading to more efficient and effective emergency medical care for patients.

## AI Bias and Systems

In 2016, Microsoft released an AI algorithm called Tay on Twitter, which quickly began posting offensive content, highlighting the issue of AI inheriting human imperfections. AI predictions, especially those involving people-related data, can perpetuate discrimination if not carefully designed and monitored. While AI adoption in point solutions, where an algorithm replaces human decision-making in a single task, may not effectively address discrimination issues, adopting a system-level mindset is crucial to tackle bias and discrimination in AI predictions effectively.

AI presents an opportunity to detect and reduce discrimination by understanding the sources of bias and using this knowledge to make fairer decisions. For example, in healthcare, AI can be used to identify factors causing disparities in pain reporting among different racial groups, leading to better treatments for affected individuals. Detecting discrimination in human decisions is challenging due to the complexity of human biases and intent, while AI can be more straightforward in identifying biases and assessing their impact. Fixing discrimination in human decision-making is difficult, requiring changes in attitudes and behaviors, while AI systems can be more amenable to fixing once biases are detected.

AI algorithms offer the potential for large-scale and systematic fixes to discrimination, which may not be achievable with human-based approaches. By including health prediction with cost prediction in AI algorithms, bias can be significantly reduced by 84%. However, fixing AI bias is not without challenges, requiring human motivation, investments in data collection and simulation, and iterative improvements.

AI can also change decision-making power dynamics within organizations, leading to resistance from individuals who may lose their discretion in the decision-making process. Amazon's experience with AI in recruiting showed the challenges of bias arising from training data and the need for new data sources to achieve neutrality.

Despite challenges, AI predictions provide objective benchmarks for equal treatment, unlike human-based interventions that may be divisive. Automated AI predictions can lead to standardized treatment, reducing discrimination in areas like traffic enforcement and hiring. While AI has the potential to reduce bias, resistance to its adoption may come from those who benefit from existing biases.

AIs present an opportunity to reduce discrimination in various domains, and their transparency allows for continuous scrutiny and improvements to ensure more equitable and fair outcomes.
