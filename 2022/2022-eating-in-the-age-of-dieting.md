## Summary

Diwekar argues against the obsession with weight loss, calorie counting, and processed "health" foods, advocating instead for eating local, seasonal, and traditional foods that our grandmothers would recognize. The book reveals how the weight loss industry has created a vicious cycle of failure while traditional eating practices naturally lead to health and wellbeing.

Perfect for anyone tired of dieting cycles, confused by conflicting nutrition advice, or seeking to reconnect with their cultural food heritage while achieving sustainable health. Readers will learn to trust their body's signals, embrace traditional foods like ghee and rice, and understand that true health comes from eating in harmony with nature rather than fighting against it.

## Core Insights

### Traditional Food Wisdom Trumps Modern Diet Culture
Diwekar demonstrates that traditional Indian eating practices are scientifically validated and superior to modern diet fads. The book shows how our ancestors naturally understood nutrition through practices like eating seasonal foods, combining food groups properly, and using all senses while eating. Modern science is finally catching up to what Indian grandmothers have known for generations—local, seasonal, traditionally cooked foods provide complete nutrition and promote health.

> "Basically, never trade common sense for science, because science eventually catches up. And say thank you to your grandmom, look at her with renewed respect; being ahead of her times was her only crime."

**Quick Take**: Trust traditional wisdom over fleeting diet trends—it has stood the test of time for good reason.

### The Three Pillars of Sustainable Health
The book outlines that good health rests on three equal pillars: Food (Local, Seasonal, Traditional), Exercise (Strength, Flexibility, Stamina), and Sleep (proper timing and habits). Diwekar emphasizes that focusing only on food while neglecting exercise and sleep is incomplete. True health comes from balancing all three pillars consistently rather than obsessing over any single aspect.

> "Health is not just about the absence of disease, but rather the presence of enthusiasm and aspiration, an ability to learn at every stage in life."

**Quick Take**: Sustainable health requires attention to all three pillars—neglecting sleep or exercise undermines even the perfect diet.

### Count What Really Matters for Health
Instead of tracking calories, steps, or weight, Diwekar suggests tracking more meaningful metrics: how many meals you eat outside home, how many weekly workouts you complete, your energy levels, skin clarity, digestion quality, and sugar cravings frequency. These indicators provide genuine insight into your health rather than the arbitrary numbers promoted by the weight loss industry.

> "Apps don't inform, they target you for your vulnerabilities. Health comes with taking responsibility for the self and not delegating it to an app."

**Quick Take**: Track behaviors and feelings rather than numbers—they're more accurate indicators of your genuine health status.

### The Self-Limiting Curve and Intuitive Eating
Drawing from both yogic philosophy and Arab culture, Diwekar introduces the concept of eating until you feel light and energetic, not stuffed. The book explains how traditional practices like allowing only odd numbers of servings (1, 3, 5, 7) naturally prevent overeating by creating a buffer zone in the stomach. This approach respects that appetite varies daily and empowers individuals to trust their body's signals.

> "It's also based on the common sense that only the person who digests the food should decide how much to eat, not some dietitian."

**Quick Take**: Your stomach is your best diet guru—learning to listen to its signals is more valuable than any external portion control system.

### Festival Foods as Nutritional Powerhouses
The book demystifies traditional festival foods, showing how items like modaks, kada prasad, and makhan are actually nutritional superfoods. Diwekar explains how these foods combine ingredients in scientifically beneficial ways—coconut and ghee provide essential fats, jaggery and rice offer steady blood sugar response, and traditional cooking methods preserve nutrients. These foods represent the perfect marriage of taste and nutrition that modern processed foods cannot replicate.

> "Modak, and why you must eat it: Devotee: because it is Bappa's favourite. Constipated: because the ghee rebuilds the intestinal mucus lining and allows for smooth elimination of toxins."

**Quick Take**: Festival foods are nutritional treasures—don't fear traditional sweets and preparations that have nourished generations.
