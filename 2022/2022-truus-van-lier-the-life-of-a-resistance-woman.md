# Truus van Lier: The Life of a Resistance Woman
**Original Title**: Truus van Lier: Het leven van een verzetsvrouw
**Author**: Jessica van Geel | **Year**: 2022 | **Category**: History & Biography

## Summary
This compelling biography reconstructs the extraordinary life of Truus van Lier, a 22-year-old Dutch law student who became the first Dutch woman to be executed for her resistance activities during World War II. Born in Utrecht in 1921 to a progressive family with strong social values, Truus evolved from an idealistic student to a courageous freedom fighter who carried out one of the most significant acts of resistance against the Nazi regime in the Netherlands.

The book chronicles her transformation from a university student into a member of the resistance movement CS-6, culminating in her assassination of NSB police chief Gerard Kerlen in September 1943. This bold act made headlines both among Allied forces and Nazi leadership, with Queen Wilhelmina expressing her admiration while Heinrich Himmler personally discussed the sanctions. Despite being executed in Sachsenhausen concentration camp alongside two other women in October 1943, Truus's story remained largely overshadowed by more famous resistance figures like Hannie Schaft. Based on extensive historical research, this meticulously documented account brings to light the forgotten story of a woman who sacrificed her life in the pursuit of justice.

This book appeals to readers interested in World War II history, women's roles in resistance movements, and stories of moral courage under occupation. It offers a valuable perspective on how ordinary individuals can become extraordinary heroes when faced with injustice.

## Core Insights

### From Student to Freedom Fighter
Truus's journey from a privileged university background to active resistance exemplifies how education and moral conviction can transform into decisive action against oppression. Growing up in Utrecht in a family that valued social justice and intellectual pursuits, she studied law at Utrecht University where she developed the critical thinking skills and ethical framework that would guide her resistance work. Her involvement with student resistance movements showed her the power of organized action against the Nazi regime.

> _Original: "Truus benadert de kwesties bij voorkeur met de wetboeken in gedachten. Bij wijze van juridische casus."_

**Quick Take**: Her legal training provided not just technical skills but a moral framework for understanding resistance as a form of justice rather than mere rebellion.

### The CS-6 Resistance Network
Truus became part of CS-6, one of the most significant resistance organizations in the Netherlands, named after their meeting place at Corellistraat 6 in Amsterdam. This group represented a new kind of resistance - organized, strategic, and willing to use targeted force against collaborators. Unlike the more common forms of resistance like hiding Jewish children or distributing illegal newspapers, CS-6 engaged in direct action including assassinations of high-ranking NSB officials.

The group operated with military precision, using cell structures to protect members and planning their actions carefully. Truus's role as a woman in this militant group challenged gender norms and demonstrated that resistance was not exclusively male territory.

**Quick Take**: The sophistication of resistance networks like CS-6 shows that opposition to occupation could be highly organized and strategically planned, contrary to popular narratives of spontaneous resistance.

### The Kerlen Assassination
On September 3, 1943, Truus assassinated Gerard Kerlen, the NSB police chief of Utrecht, making her likely the first Dutch woman to single-handedly eliminate a high-ranking collaborator. This was not an act of impulse but a carefully planned operation targeting someone directly responsible for persecuting resistance members and enforcing Nazi policies. The assassination demonstrated how resistance fighters used targeted force to disrupt the collaborationist infrastructure.

The operation's impact extended far beyond Utrecht - it was discussed at the highest levels of both Allied and German command. Queen Wilhelmina in London learned of the action, while Heinrich Himmler himself was personally informed of the sanctions to follow.

> _Original: "September 1943. De moord op de NSB-politiehoofdcommissaris Gerard Kerlen is voorpaginanieuws."_

**Quick Take**: Targeted resistance actions could have strategic impact far beyond their immediate tactical objectives, influencing both enemy responses and Allied morale.

### Women in Resistance History
The book highlights the systematic underrepresentation of women in resistance narratives. While figures like Hannie Schaft became legendary, many women like Truus who engaged in equally dangerous resistance work remained largely unknown. This gap in historical memory reflects postwar gender biases that redefined "real resistance" as primarily male activities involving weapons and direct action.

The author's research reveals that women participated in all aspects of resistance, from intelligence gathering to armed operations. Yet their contributions were often minimized in postwar accounts that conformed to traditional gender roles, portraying women primarily as couriers or helpers rather than combatants.

**Quick Take**: Understanding women's full participation in resistance requires looking beyond traditional historical narratives that often reflect postwar social attitudes rather than wartime realities.

### Moral Complexity of Resistance
Truus and her resistance colleagues constantly grappled with profound ethical questions about their actions. They debated whether assassinating one collaborator was justified if it led to retaliation against innocent civilians. These discussions show that resistance fighters were not simply acting on emotion but making calculated moral decisions under extreme pressure.

The book reveals how young educated people used their intellectual training to navigate these moral dilemmas, often framing their actions in legal and philosophical terms. This intellectual approach to resistance challenges simplistic narratives of wartime heroism.

**Quick Take**: Effective resistance required not just courage but also sophisticated moral reasoning to navigate the ethical complexities of violent opposition to occupation.
