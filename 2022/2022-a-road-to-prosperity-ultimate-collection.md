The Formless Substance that makes up all things responds to focused thought, creating whatever we consistently impress upon it.

Conwell's famous lecture reveals that opportunity is always closer than it appears. Success doesn't require distant travels or exotic circumstances—it's found in recognizing the value within your current situation, community, and immediate sphere of influence.

**Quick Take**: The greatest opportunities often lie hidden in plain sight. Success comes from developing the vision to see value where others see only the ordinary and having the wisdom to develop what's already at hand.

### The Master Key System - Charles F. Haanel
Haanel presents a sophisticated system for mastering the relationship between the inner world of thought and the outer world of manifestation. The Master Key teaches that all power comes from within, and by understanding and controlling our mental states, we gain control over external conditions.
