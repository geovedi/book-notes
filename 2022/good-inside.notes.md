## Building Connection and Addressing Behaviors
- Strategies to build connection with deeply feeling kids (DFKs) and address challenging behaviors are discussed.
- Emphasize understanding and empathizing with DFKs, who experience emotions more intensely and become easily overwhelmed.
- Shift from blame to curiosity to understand the child's underlying needs and fears.
- Containment: Prioritize keeping the child safe in moments of dysregulation by providing a smaller, calm space.
- Assert the parent's role as a sturdy leader who can handle the child's overwhelming emotions.
- View the DFK as a "good kid having a hard time" to maintain a compassionate perspective.
- Offer support and reassurance to reassure the child of their love and commitment.
- Presence: The parent's calm and loving presence communicates safety and acceptance to the DFK.
- Thumbs Up/Down/to the Side game: Allow the child to express agreement, disagreement, or mixed feelings about emotions without direct confrontation.
- Create a safe space for expression to increase the child's tolerance for emotions and vulnerability.
- Case example of Angie and Maura, where Angie practices containment and uses the Thumbs Up/Down/to the Side game to understand and support her daughter's struggles.
- Importance of building a secure connection with DFKs, recognizing their intense emotions, and providing a safe and supportive environment for emotional growth and development.
