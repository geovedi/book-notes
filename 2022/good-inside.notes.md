## Dr. Becky's Parenting Principles

### Good Inside
- The Assumption of Internal Goodness:
  - Dr. Becky asserts that both parents and children are inherently good inside, at their core.
  - This principle guides her work, enabling her to understand the reasons behind challenging behaviors.
- Curiosity and Frameworks for Change:
  - By approaching behaviors with curiosity and assuming internal goodness, effective frameworks and strategies are developed for fostering change.
  - This principle serves as the foundation, guiding parents to intervene differently and positively.
- Challenges of Applying the Principle:
  - Frustration and anger can easily overshadow the assumption of internal goodness.
  - In tough parenting moments, the tendency to operate with the assumption of internal badness prevails.
- Internal Badness vs. Internal Goodness:
  - Behaviorism often reinforces the perception of internal badness, leading to controlling behaviors instead of trusting children.
  - Dr. Becky emphasizes that understanding internal goodness doesn't excuse bad behavior or promote permissiveness.
- Connection to Behavior and Identity:
  - Differentiating between behavior and identity is crucial for preserving relationships while driving meaningful change.
  - Recognizing the good child beneath "bad behavior" is essential for effective intervention.
- Shifting Perspectives: Breaking Intergenerational Patterns:
  - Intergenerational patterns can perpetuate a belief in internal badness.
  - Parents are empowered to be cycle-breakers, changing the direction of generational patterns.
- Rewiring Circuitry and Reflecting on Childhood:
  - Childhood experiences impact self-perception and influence how parents respond to their own children.
  - How caregivers responded to struggles becomes how we respond to ourselves, setting the stage for how we treat our children.
- The Most Generous Interpretation (MGI):
  - The MGI involves asking, "What is my most generous interpretation of what just happened?"
  - This approach softens interactions and promotes better understanding in challenging situations.
- Empathy over Criticism:
  - Responding with empathy and understanding helps children build healthy coping mechanisms.
  - Reflecting their internal goodness fosters their self-confidence and capacity for empathy.
- Parents' Reflections Impact Children's Self-Views:
  - Children shape their self-views based on parents' responses to their behavior.
  - Positive reflections from parents encourage children's self-confidence and empathy.
- Valuing Internal Goodness for Growth:
  - Recognizing internal goodness under struggles promotes growth and positive change.
  - Dr. Becky's approach emphasizes the importance of feeling secure in recognizing and nurturing one's inherent goodness.

### Two Things Are True
- Introduction:
  - Many parents struggle with balancing discipline and fun in parenting.
  - The concept of holding two opposing truths simultaneously is central to the "Two Things Are True" parenting approach.
- Acknowledging Multiplicity:
  - The idea that individuals can embody multiple roles and feelings at once.
  - Applying this concept to parenting leads to better relationships and understanding.
- Understanding vs. Convincing:
  - Understanding involves seeking to comprehend another person's perspective, feelings, and experience.
  - Convincing aims to prove a singular reality, often leading to conflict and feelings of being unheard.
- Multiplicity and Healthy Relationships:
  - Accepting that multiple truths exist within a relationship fosters connection and closeness.
  - Holding multiple perspectives helps people feel seen, fostering better interactions.
- Applying "Two Things Are True" in Parenting:
  - Acknowledging both parents' and children's experiences as valid and real.
  - Using the approach to navigate conflicts, boundaries, and communication.
- Examples of Applying the Approach:
  - Holding Boundaries Amid Protest:
     - Balancing firm decisions with validating children's feelings.
     - Acknowledging both the decision and the child's emotional response.

     - Transitioning from a me-versus-you mindset to a problem-solving, me-and-you mentality.
     - Recognizing the importance of feeling seen in resolving conflicts.
  - Responding to Child's Rudeness:
     - Understanding that rude behavior stems from dysregulated feelings.
     - Validating the child's underlying emotions while addressing inappropriate behavior.

- Embracing Complexity for Healthier Parenting:
  - Encouraging a mindset that allows for multiple, seemingly contradictory thoughts and emotions.
  - Recognizing that both parents and children can hold diverse experiences and emotions simultaneously.

### Know Your Job
- Roles and Responsibilities in Family Systems:
  - Clearly defined roles and responsibilities are crucial for smooth functioning within any system.
  - Family units are also systems, with every member having a job.
  - Parents' job is to establish safety through boundaries, validation, and empathy.
  - Children's job is to explore, learn, and express emotions.
- Importance of Staying in Your Lane:
  - Members must stick to their designated roles to prevent confusion and dysfunction.
  - Parents shouldn't let kids dictate boundaries, and kids shouldn't dictate parents' feelings.
  - Safety is a priority over happiness and pleasing children.
- Safety as a Primary Job:
  - Parents' foremost job is to keep children safe both physically and psychologically.
  - Failure to ensure safety can create anxiety and undermine children's trust.
  - Children need parents to intervene and keep them safe to develop emotion regulation skills.
- Boundaries as Pathways to Safety:
  - Boundaries are essential for protecting and containing children's experiences.
  - Parents set boundaries out of love to shield children from poor decision-making.
  - Boundaries prevent children from engaging in actions they're developmentally incapable of managing.
- Developmental Differences and Regulation:
  - Children's downstairs brain (emotion and impulse) develops early, while the upstairs brain (complex functions) takes longer.
  - Children struggle with self-awareness, empathy, and decision-making due to upstairs brain still developing.
  - Parents serve as bridges, linking the downstairs brain to the upstairs brain.
- Incorporating Validation and Empathy:
  - Validation is recognizing and accepting someone's emotional experience as real.
  - Empathy involves understanding and relating to another person's feelings.
  - Validation and empathy help children build healthy emotion regulation skills.
- The Process of Setting Boundaries:
  - Boundaries are not just saying "stop," but also what the parent will do.
  - Parents use physicality when needed to keep children safe (not using force to intimidate).
- Validation and Empathy in Boundary Setting:
  - Combining boundaries with validation and empathy creates a supportive environment.
  - Boundaries show children that emotions won't spiral out of control forever.
  - Validation and empathy help children find their goodness amid struggles.
- Child's Job in the Family System:
  - Children's role is to explore, learn, and express emotions.
  - They learn through boundary testing, challenging parents, and trying new things.
- Reflecting on Job Fulfillment:
  - Reviewing moments with children through the lens of roles prevents blame and self-doubt.
  - Recognizing each person's role in the family system provides clarity in challenging situations.

### The Early Years Matter
- Importance of Parenting and Early Years
  - Parenting matters as it shapes children's experiences and behaviors.
  - Early childhood memories, even if not consciously recalled, have a profound impact.
  - Children learn from interactions with parents what is acceptable, manageable, and shameful.
  - Early relationships influence self-perception, expectations of others, and emotional regulation.
  - Parenting during early years forms the foundation for adulthood and important dynamics.
- Attachment Theory
  - Attachment theory explains children's innate drive to attach to caregivers for survival.
  - Attachment formation impacts internal working models that influence how they interact with themselves and others.
  - Children's questions shape their attachment: "Am I lovable?", "Will I be heard?", etc.
  - Children create generalized lessons about attachment based on interactions with parents.
  - Parental responses influence whether vulnerability is safe or threatening in relationships.
- Internal Family Systems (IFS)
  - IFS considers multiple parts or subpersonalities within a person.
  - Children's minds are subdivided into parts with different emotions and behaviors.
  - Integrating IFS with attachment theory provides a nuanced view of children's development.
  - Early experiences influence children's perceptions of their parts and how they seek connection.
- Impact of Early Interactions
  - Children wire themselves to adapt to their environment for attachment and survival.
  - Different parental responses lead to contrasting attachment lessons.
  - Secure attachments enable children to explore, take risks, and be vulnerable in adulthood.
  - Children's internal working models from early interactions affect adult relationships.
  - Parenting in early years is crucial for building secure, balanced adult relationships.
- Importance of Recognizing Feelings
  - Separating behavior from underlying feelings is vital for healthy development.

  - Examples of children's behaviors that relate to shame: refusal to apologize, stubbornness, and lying.
  - Children react to guilt or bad feelings by shutting down and avoiding dealing with these emotions.
- Understanding Shame
  - Shame is defined as the feeling that a part of oneself is not connectable, leading to a desire to hide or distance from others.
  - It activates a fear of being unlovable and abandoned, which is threatening for children who rely on attachment for survival.
  - Shame is evolutionarily adaptive, signaling the need to hide parts of oneself that might hinder attachment.
- Impact of Shame
  - Shame leads to a child feeling frozen and numb, making them unable to engage effectively.
  - Parents often misinterpret this behavior as rudeness or apathy, resulting in power struggles or yelling.
  - Shame in children's difficult moments adds fuel to conflicts and makes situations more explosive.
- Detecting and Reducing Shame
  - Detecting shame is essential for effective parenting, as many difficult moments involve shame.
  - Identifying shame allows parents to modify behavior to address it and reduce its impact.
  - Shame can appear as indifference, numbness, or avoidance.
  - The key is to shift focus from correcting behavior to reducing shame.
- Intervening with Connection and Understanding
  - Intervention should focus on shame detection and reduction, rather than forcing behaviors like apologizing.
  - For example, instead of pressuring a child to apologize, a parent might model the apology to reduce shame.
  - This approach aims to help the child feel secure and loved, which is crucial for them to "unstick" from shame.
- Shame's Long-Term Effects
  - Unchecked shame can lead to long-term effects in adulthood, affecting how individuals handle vulnerability and emotions.
  - The lessons learned in childhood around suppressing emotions can impact adult behavior and relationships.
  - Shame can hinder personal growth, communication, and emotional expression.
- Connection First

  - Connection doesn't mean approval of behavior; it's about valuing the relationship with the person.
- Impactful Role of Connection
  - Connection allows for movement and positive behavior change, unlike shame which stagnates.
  - Parents can show their children that it's okay to be themselves even when they're struggling, fostering a sense of acceptance and security.

### Tell the Truth
- Introduction:
  - Honesty in parenting is crucial but can be challenging to practice effectively.

  - Externalizing a struggle reduces shame and self-blame, making space for compassionate problem-solving.
- Embracing Imperfections:
  - Everyone, including parents, makes mistakes in their interactions with children.
  - Imperfections are part of being human, not an indication of being a bad parent.
  - Moments that feel awful can be opportunities for growth and connection.
- The Power of Repair:
  - Repairing relationships is more important than avoiding ruptures.
  - Rupture moments happen when both parties are focused on their own experiences and can't connect with the other person.
  - Repairing goes beyond apologizing; it aims to reestablish connection after someone feels hurt or misunderstood.
  - Healthy relationships are defined by their ability to repair and deepen connections.
- Components of Effective Repair:
  - Reflection:
     - Share thoughts about the situation, showing active consideration.
  - Acknowledgment:
     - Recognize the other person's feelings and experiences.
  - Taking Responsibility:
     - Express what could have been done differently and take ownership of actions.

  - Repairs can vary in length and structure, based on personal comfort.
  - The key is taking ownership and assuring children that their feelings are not responsible for the parent's reactions.
  - Repair prevents children from turning to self-blame and self-doubt when faced with tough emotions.
  - Repair replaces feelings of isolation with connection, benefiting both parties.

### Not Listening
- Understanding the "Not Listening" Challenge:
  - Parents often complain that their children don't listen, but the issue is more about cooperation than listening.
  - Children's cooperation is influenced by how close they feel to the person making the request.
- Framing the Problem as a Relationship Issue:
  - The struggle of a child not cooperating reflects a need for relationship strengthening rather than being solely a parenting issue.
  - Recognizing that all parent-child relationships need extra attention helps in addressing this challenge.
- Importance of Connection in Cooperation:
  - Connecting with a child's world before making a request is crucial for them to cooperate.
  - Feeling seen and acknowledged creates a powerful bond that motivates cooperation.
  - Acknowledging a child's current activity communicates that their perspective matters.
- Giving Children Agency Through Choices:
  - Allowing children to make choices increases their willingness to cooperate.
  - Offering options that parents are comfortable with and trusting children to follow through builds cooperation.
  - Providing choices aligns with children's desire for control and reduces feelings of being dictated to.
- Using Humor to Facilitate Cooperation:
  - Infusing playfulness and humor changes perspectives and fosters cooperation.
  - Playful approaches create a more enjoyable environment, increasing the likelihood of cooperation.
- "Close Your Eyes" Hack:
  - The "Close Your Eyes" technique involves temporarily closing one's eyes and creating a playful scenario.
  - By giving children control and introducing silliness, cooperation is encouraged.
  - This approach builds trust and respect, motivating children to fulfill requests.
- Role-Reversal Game:
  - Playing the "I have to listen to you now" game helps children empathize with the challenges of taking orders.
  - Reverse roles allow children to experience control and build connection.
  - Empathy and role-reversal foster a cooperative atmosphere.
- Application to Specific Scenario (Sonia and Felix):
  - Sonia's frustration with her son Felix's lack of cooperation leads her to focus on strengthening their relationship.
  - Recognizing that cooperation comes from connection, she engages in playful activities and role-reversal with Felix.
  - Applying the strategies of connection, giving choices, and humor, Sonia experiences improved cooperation from Felix.

### Emotional Tantrums
- Understanding Tantrums as a Developmental Process:
  - Tantrums are a normal and healthy part of child development.
  - They occur when a child's emotional demands exceed their capacity to regulate their feelings.
  - Tantrums are not willful acts of disobedience but biological states of dysregulation.
- The Purpose of Tantrums and Recognizing Feelings:
  - Tantrums signify a child's unmet desires and frustration when they're unable to fulfill them.
  - Tantrums are a way of expressing the persistence of a desire even when faced with denial.
  - Tantrums are a crucial part of teaching children to assert their desires and build emotional regulation skills.
- Embracing the Emotional Release and Building Regulation:
  - Tantrums involve a buildup of distressing feelings, which may explode in a meltdown.
  - Just as adults have meltdowns due to accumulating distress, children's tantrums reflect their emotional turmoil.
  - Understanding the distress behind tantrums helps parents respond with empathy and support.
- Parenting Strategies During Tantrums:
  - The goal during a tantrum is not to stop it but to remain calm and keep the child safe.
  - Strategies are aimed at connecting with the child, showing understanding, and helping them regulate their emotions.
  - Parents should not avoid or shut down children's emotions; instead, they should provide regulation through their presence.
- Specific Strategies for Dealing with Tantrums:
  - Remind yourself of your own goodness and ability to cope with the situation.
  - Emphasize that decisions are made by parents, while children are allowed to have their feelings.
  - Name the unmet wish underlying the tantrum to connect with the child's perspective.
  - Validate the magnitude of the child's feelings to help them process and express their distress.
- Application to Specific Scenario (Orly and Ezra):
  - Orly encounters a tantrum when Ezra demands ice cream for breakfast.
  - She reminds herself that her role is to stay calm and keep Ezra safe, not to end the tantrum.
  - Orly communicates to Ezra that his feelings are valid while setting the limit on the request.
  - Using strategies like validation and naming the wish, Orly acknowledges Ezra's emotions and waits for the tantrum to subside.

### Aggressive Tantrums (Hitting, Biting, Throwing)
- Tantrums and Emotional Regulation
  - Tantrums are a normal and healthy part of child development.
  - Tantrums indicate a child's inability to manage overwhelming emotions.
  - Tantrums stem from unmet desires or needs and are not acts of disobedience.
  - Encouraging emotional expression in childhood supports confidence and assertiveness in adulthood.
  - Tantrums release built-up distressing feelings, like frustration, disappointment, and anger.
- Strategies for Handling Tantrums without Aggression: Connecting and Empathizing
  - Parents should focus on connecting with their child during tantrums, not stopping them immediately.
  - Strategies aim to build emotion regulation skills and acknowledge the child's desires.
  - Remind yourself of your own goodness and your capacity to handle the situation.
  - Validate your child's feelings and communicate that they're allowed to feel upset.
  - Name the underlying wish causing the tantrum to show empathy and understanding.
  - Validate the magnitude of your child's feelings to help them recognize their intensity.
  - Stay calm and contain your child during a tantrum for safety and regulation.
  - Use "I won't let you" language to establish parental authority and containment.
  - Differentiate between urges and actions, redirecting urges to safe outlets.
  - Contain the child's emotional "fire" by creating a safe space and offering comfort.
  - Personify the feelings causing the tantrum, recognizing that they're not directed at you.
  - Telling the story of the tantrum afterwards adds coherence and connection.
- Handling Tantrums with Aggression: Containing Explosive Moments
  - Tantrums involving aggression signal a child's inability to regulate emotions and are rooted in the underdeveloped prefrontal cortex.
  - Aggressive tantrums are a way for children to protect themselves from overwhelming sensations.
  - Embodying parental authority is crucial but can be challenging for many adults.
  - Children need containment during explosive tantrums to prevent danger.
  - "I won't let you" language establishes parental control and prevents dangerous behavior.
  - Differentiate between urges and actions, allowing safe outlets for emotional discharge.
  - Containment is crucial; imagine the child's feelings as a fire and focus on limiting its reach.
  - Personify the feelings causing aggressive outbursts to help maintain empathy.
  - Telling the story of explosive tantrums builds coherence and connection for regulation.
- Example Scenario: Liam and Allison
  - Four-year-old Liam's aggressive tantrum over a water bottle illustrates these strategies.
  - Allison uses "I won't let you" language, physically contains Liam, and maintains her authority.

### Sibling Rivalry
- Introduction:
  - Sibling conflicts are common and rooted in the complex dynamics that arise from the addition of a new sibling.
  - Elaine Mazlish and Adele Faber's analogy: Adding a sibling is similar to a partner getting a second spouse, which can evoke feelings of confusion and insecurity.
  - Siblings argue to communicate feelings of unsettlement and threat to their essential need for security within the family.
- Attachment and Abandonment:
  - The addition of a sibling triggers attachment needs and abandonment fears in older children.
  - Children seek safety and wonder if their needs will be met, if they are appreciated for who they are, and if they are considered good within the family.
- Complexity of Sibling Relationships:
  - Sibling relationships are multifaceted and shouldn't be oversimplified with unrealistic expectations.
  - Birth order plays a significant role: Firstborn children experience a shift from being the only child, while later-born children grow up in a sibling-centric environment.
- Strategies for Healthy Sibling Relationships:
  - PNP Time (Play No Phone Time): Dedicated one-on-one time with each child builds security and reduces rivalry.
  - Individual Needs over Fairness: Focusing on individual needs rather than strict fairness reduces competition and encourages internal orientation.
  - Allowing Venting: Creating a safe space for children to express their feelings towards their siblings helps them manage emotions.
  - Step In When There's Danger: Intervening when dangerous behavior occurs, protecting both the child acting out and the child being targeted.
  - Slow Down and Narrate: Slowing down conflicts without solving them, allowing children to regulate themselves and develop problem-solving skills.
- Application of Strategies:
  - Ray, as a father, applies the mentioned strategies:
    - Models self-regulation and deep breathing to de-escalate conflicts.

### Rudeness and Defiance
- Understanding Rudeness and Defiance:
  - Parents often react to children's rudeness and defiance as signs of disrespect, but it's important to consider the emotional dysregulation underlying such behavior.
  - Rudeness and defiance in children can stem from feeling misunderstood, frustrated, or overwhelmed.
- Emotion Dysregulation in Children:
  - Children's limited emotion regulation skills can lead to behaviors like rudeness and defiance when they are unable to manage intense feelings.
  - Big feelings can manifest as negative behavior, such as Farrah's explosive statements, "I hate you" or "I hope you drown."
- Separating Behavior from Feelings:
  - Parents should distinguish between a child's underdeveloped regulation skills and their genuine emotions (anger, sadness).
  - Rudeness and defiance should be seen as a plea for understanding, a way to communicate deeper feelings.
- Reframing the Approach:
  - Punishment doesn't necessarily reinforce bad behavior; instead, addressing rudeness with empathy and kindness promotes a healthier response from the child.
  - A positive approach involves interpreting the behavior as a sign of deeper vulnerabilities and responding accordingly.
- Strategies for Handling Rudeness and Defiance:
  - Don't Take the Bait:
    - Set boundaries around behavior.
    - Provide a generous interpretation of underlying emotions.
  - Embody Authority Without Punishing:
    - Embrace authority without intimidating.
    - Narrate reassertion of boundaries, focusing on helping the child with impulse control.
  - State the Truth:
    - Validate the child's experience before setting rules.
    - Open a dialogue for brainstorming and coping in advance.
  - Connect and Build Regulation:
    - Reconnect with the child during periods of rudeness and defiance.
    - Use techniques like "Did I ever tell you about the time..." or the Fill-Up Game.
  - Importance of PNP Time (Play No Phone Time):
    - Dedicated one-on-one time with children strengthens connections and helps regulate behavior.
- Application of Strategies:
  - Farrah's situation with Heather exemplifies the strategies:
    - Heather recognizes Farrah's dysregulation and responds with understanding, acknowledging her feelings.
    - Heather uses presence and shares a relatable story to reconnect with Farrah and reinforce her goodness.

### Whining
- Understanding Whining Behavior:
  - Whining in children often stems from a combination of strong desire and powerlessness.
  - Parents can misinterpret whining as lack of gratitude, but it's more about children feeling helpless and seeking connection.
- Triggers for Whining:
  - Parents might be triggered by whining due to their own upbringing where vulnerability wasn't accepted.
  - When children whine, it might evoke past reactions from parents and create a sense of urgency to shut down the behavior.
- Whining as a Plea for Connection:
  - Children whine when they seek emotional release and connection, indicating they need to let out feelings.
  - Responding with understanding and validation can reduce the frequency of whining.
- Strategies for Handling Whining:
  - Channel Your Inner Whiner:
    - Embrace vulnerability and powerlessness, reducing your reactivity to children's whining.
    - Acknowledge that strong, resilient people can feel helpless too.
  - Use Humor:
    - Respond to whining with playful humor to connect and offer hopefulness.
    - Playfulness should be lighthearted and not mocking.

- Lies as a Form of Coping:
  - Kids may lie to cope with guilt, shame, or fear of disappointing their parents.
  - Lying can be a way for children to feel control, protection, and a sense of self.
- Changing the Parent-Child Cycle:
  - Changing the lying pattern involves understanding and addressing its underlying causes rather than focusing on immediate confessions.
  - Strategies aim to create an environment where truth-telling is encouraged and supported.
- Strategies for Addressing Lying:
  - Reframe the Lie as a Wish:
    - Viewing lies as a wish allows for understanding beyond truth or lies, fostering connection and empathy.
    - Responding with the language of wishing shifts the conversation towards a common perspective.
  - Wait and Provide an Opening Later:
    - In the moment of a lie, avoid power struggles and defensiveness.
    - Wait for an opportunity to provide a non-judgmental opening for honesty later, acknowledging potential underlying issues.
  - "If It Did Happen..." Approach:
    - Describe how you would respond if the truth were told, creating a safe space for honesty.
    - Offer understanding and reflection without pressing for immediate confessions.
  - Asking a Child What He Needs to Be Honest:
    - Engage in a calm discussion about what a child needs to be truthful.
    - Build an environment where truth-telling feels safe and where children's needs are understood.
- Application of Strategies:
  - In the case of Dara and Jake:
    - Dara avoids escalating the situation when Jake denies pushing Owen.
    - She reframes the lie as a wish and communicates her commitment to understanding and helping Jake.
    - Dara fosters a connection and provides Jake with an opportunity to share the truth later, focusing on their relationship and not immediate confessions.
    - Ultimately, they discuss the underlying issue of anger and work together to address it.

### Fears and Anxiety
- Understanding Childhood Fears:
  - Children experience fear as a bodily response to perceived threats, leading to somatic experiences like increased heart rate and stomach discomfort.
  - It's crucial to recognize that children's fears are not exaggerated for attention; they genuinely experience panic and need adult help to feel safe again.
  - The goal for parents is to help children transition from feeling endangered to feeling safe.
- Ineffective Approaches to Addressing Fear:
  - Trying to rationalize or convince a child out of their fear in the moment is not successful because fear triggers a stress response that impairs logical thinking.
  - Logic and reasoning are less effective; children need connection and presence to feel safe during fearful moments.
  - Attempting to convince a child to feel more positive or less anxious can increase anxiety, as it sends the message that their feelings are wrong.
- Effective Strategies for Dealing with Fear:
  - Jump into the Hole with Them:
    - Visualize the child's fear as a hole and metaphorically "jump into" the fear with the child, providing companionship and showing that the fear is not as scary when faced together.
  - Dry Runs:
    - Avoiding discussing fears or avoiding situations that trigger fears increases anxiety.
    - Conducting "dry runs" by rehearsing the challenging situation can provide practice, mastery, and familiarity with the feared scenario.
  - Script for Addressing Specific Fears:
    - Address fears head-on by talking to the child, gathering information, validating their fear, and problem-solving together.
    - Engage the child in brainstorming coping mechanisms and encourage them to create a mantra to manage anxiety in the moment.
    - Share a personal story of gradually coping with fear to provide reassurance.
- Encouraging a Healthy Relationship with Fear:
  - The goal is not to eliminate fear but to help children manage it by increasing their tolerance and allowing coexistence with other emotions.
  - Parents should remain curious about their child's anxiety, providing acceptance and comfort when anxiety arises.
- Application of Strategies:
  - In the case of Blake and Leo:
    - Leo recognizes Blake's fear of fire and offers companionship by acknowledging her feelings and sharing his own experiences.

  - Remember the child is a "good kid having a hard time" during meltdowns.
  - Be present and patient; your loving presence communicates stability and acceptance.
  - Use the Thumbs Up/Down/to the Side game to talk about feelings without overwhelming DFKs.
- Example of Implementation:
  - Angie uses containment first when Maura escalates into a meltdown.
  - Angie reassures Maura that she's a good kid having a hard time and stays present.
  - After calming down, Angie plays the Thumbs Up/Down/to the Side game with Maura to discuss feelings.
