# The Pragmatist's Guide to Crafting Religion
**Authors**: Simone Collins, Malcolm Collins | **Year**: 2022 | **Category**: Philosophy & Critical Thinking

## Summary
"The Pragmatist's Guide to Crafting Religion" presents a bold framework for designing intentional family cultures that can reverse demographic collapse and ensure long-term human flourishing. The Collins argue that humanity faces an existential crisis from plummeting birth rates, with many developed nations falling below replacement level fertility. They propose that the solution lies in consciously crafting "cultivars"—intentional cultures that combine the best elements of ancestral traditions with modern innovations, creating sustainable communities that produce high birth rates and strong cultural fidelity.

The book serves as both a diagnosis of civilization's demographic challenges and a practical playbook for anyone wanting to build or restore a culture capable of carrying human progress forward. Readers interested in cultural design, family formation, demographic trends, or civilization-level challenges will find concrete strategies for creating resilient, pro-natal communities.

## Core Insights

### Culture as Evolutionary Technology
The Collins frame culture as a memetic technology that evolves through natural selection, with successful cultures demonstrating high birth rates, strong cultural fidelity (low attrition), effective adoption mechanisms, and sustainable death rates. They argue that most modern cultures are failing because they've lost their pro-natal edge, particularly as internet and social media exposure accelerates cultural "bleed."

The key insight is that culture isn't just heritage—it's a reproductive strategy. Cultures that fail to produce above-replacement birth rates are evolutionarily dead ends, regardless of how virtuous or successful their members may be in other domains.

> "Birth rate is the most important cultural growth factor. Cultivars with low birth rates are virtual non-players in the game of civilization and can largely be ignored by your culture once you have addressed any bleed they may cause."

**Quick Take**: Your culture's success ultimately depends on whether your grandchildren share it with their children.

### The Cultural Spectrum: Hard vs. Soft Cultures
The book categorizes cultures on a spectrum from "hard" to "soft." Hard cultures (like Mormons, Amish, Orthodox Jews) maintain strict boundaries, unique dress, social safety nets, and high birth rates—but are currently collapsing due to internet exposure. Soft cultures (like "spiritual but not religious" Christians, Unitarian Universalists) are more socially acceptable but have below-replacement fertility rates.

The critical discovery is that the internet has broken the isolation that once protected hard cultures, causing their birth rates to plummet and attrition to skyrocket. Only groups like the Amish, who strictly control internet access, maintain high fertility.

> "Until recently, hard cultures represented some of the world's most successful civilizations, having a low bleed and high birth rate... In the last decade or so, many of these cultures' attrition rates have skyrocketed while their birth rates have begun plummeting."

**Quick Take**: Cultural isolation, once a bug, is now a feature for sustaining high-fertility communities.

### The Index: A Cultural Reactor System
The authors propose "The Index"—a structured network of family units called "Houses" that function as cultural laboratories. Each House maintains distinct traditions while participating in a broader ecosystem that tracks outcomes, enables cultural evolution, and provides infrastructure for dating, childcare, and shared resources.

This system allows children to rebel productively by creating their own House rather than abandoning their family culture entirely. It also enables inter-cultural marriage without forcing families to water down their traditions or choose between competing identities.

> "The Index is meant to serve as a self-contained cultural ecosystem strong enough to carry the torch of civilization through the encroaching darkness. We invite other Pragmatists to join us in trying to create a unified network of cultures inspired by a variety of backgrounds and life experiences."

**Quick Take**: Design your family culture to evolve across generations, not remain static.

### The Demographic Economic Collapse
The book presents a stark economic analysis: when population declines exponentially while productivity only increases linearly, stock markets and economic systems face permanent contraction. South Korea's 0.81 birth rate means that for every 100 great-grandparents, only 6.6 great-grandchildren will exist—a 94% population collapse within a century.

This isn't a distant problem; it's already underway. The authors argue that no secret backup plan exists among global elites, and artificial intelligence may be the only potential "Deus ex machina" that could prevent systemic economic failure.

> "When this happens, the stock market, on average, will begin to shrink. When that happens, people will stop putting their money there—we will stop investing in the future. The civilization we have built is about to undergo a massive and permanent change."

**Quick Take**: Demographic collapse will permanently reshape economic systems within our lifetime.

### The "Supervirus" Analysis
The Collins identify what they call a "supervirus"—a memetic package descended from Hicksite Quaker culture that prioritizes emotional validation over objective truth and systematically attacks high-fertility, successful cultures. This virus, they argue, has become the dominant secular culture in Western societies.

Key characteristics include using personal feelings as evidence, prioritizing aesthetics over outcomes, encouraging public shaming of outsiders, and reverencing youth as moral authorities. The virus spreads through educational systems and organizational bureaucracies, leaving destroyed institutions in its wake.

> "What makes the supervirus unique and especially dangerous is that it actively attacks the memetic immune systems of cultures and institutions that could conceivably outcompete it."

**Quick Take**: Modern progressive culture functions as a parasitoid that destroys its host cultures' reproductive capacity.

## Best Quotes
- "For every 100 South Korean great-grandparents, there will be 6.6 great-grandkids... Imagine if we knew a disease would kill 94% of South Koreans in the next century. We are not far from Korea's present predicament."
- "Birth rate is the most important cultural growth factor. Cultivars with low birth rates are virtual non-players in the game of civilization."
- "The Index was designed to prevent this—to allow hard-culture-like factions to become different without losing the ability to interact and reintegrate."
- "We no longer believe that it is possible to avert most of the severe economic, governmental, and social consequences associated with a 'hard landing' from population collapse."
- "Anyone who can craft a self-sustaining new cultivar that produces competent, highly educated, technophilic individuals gets the chance to write the future of human civilization."

## Action Items
- **Assess Your Cultural Baseline**: Identify elements from your ancestral and chosen cultures that promote family formation and high fertility
- **Design Cultural Boundaries**: Create practices that distinguish your community while maintaining connection to broader society
- **Build Inter-Generational Intent**: Structure your family culture to evolve and improve across generations, not remain static
- **Develop Cultural Infrastructure**: Implement systems for music, rituals, holidays, and gatherings that reinforce identity and community bonds
- **Consider the Index Model**: Whether joining the authors' proposed network or creating your own, develop mechanisms for cultural evolution and cooperation

## Questions to Consider
- What cultural traditions from your ancestry or experience actually help families thrive and have more children?
- How can you maintain cultural distinctiveness without isolation that limits opportunities for your children?
- What would need to change about your current lifestyle to make raising larger families more feasible and rewarding?
- If you could design a family culture from scratch, what elements would you preserve, modify, or eliminate?
- How should communities balance individual freedom with collective responsibility for demographic continuity?

## Conclusion
This book is worth your time if you're concerned about civilization's future, interested in cultural design, or planning to raise a family. Its biggest strength is the brutally honest demographic analysis combined with concrete frameworks for action. The Collins make a compelling case that intentional culture-building isn't just a lifestyle choice—it's essential for human flourishing.

The book will particularly resonate with those who feel that modern culture has lost something essential about family, community, and inter-generational continuity. While some may find the authors' analysis of "cultural viruses" controversial, their demographic data and cultural framework are undeniable.

Whether you agree with their conclusions or not, "The Pragmatist's Guide to Crafting Religion" will change how you think about culture, family, and civilization's future. At minimum, it will convince you that demographic collapse is the most urgent crisis facing humanity—and that cultural innovation is our best hope for addressing it.
