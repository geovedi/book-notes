***

"Crime and Punishment" follows the story of Rodion Romanovich Raskolnikov, a young man burdened by debt and inner turmoil. He becomes obsessed with the idea of committing a crime to prove his superiority and test his theory that extraordinary individuals are above conventional morality and have the right to transgress the law for a higher purpose.

Driven by desperation and a desire to improve his impoverished circumstances, Raskolnikov plans and executes the murder of an old pawnbroker, Aliona Ivanovna. However, during the crime, he accidentally kills her innocent sister, Lizaveta Ivanovna.

## PART ONE


Raskolnikov, a young man burdened by debt and anxiety, seeks to avoid his landlady and wanders towards K. Bridge, deep in contemplation and fearing encounters with others. He decides to pawn his watch to the old woman, Aliona Ivanovna, but she eyes him suspiciously. Despite her suspicions, Raskolnikov manages to pawn the watch successfully. This sparks thoughts of pawning more items in the future, and he mentions a cigarette box he intends to retrieve from a friend. Overwhelmed by repulsion and torment, he seeks solace in a tavern and numbs his emotions with beer.

In the dimly lit tavern, Raskolnikov finds himself amidst a few people, including a group with a girl playing a concertina and a drunk man with a gray beard. Unaccustomed to crowds and society in general, he suddenly desires company to escape his miserable state. Yet, the tavern's atmosphere is unpleasant and filthy. Amidst this setting, a retired clerk named Marmeladov approaches him, showing interest in conversation. Marmeladov is a disheveled man with a bloated face from excessive drinking, but despite his appearance, he maintains a respectable demeanor. He shares his story of poverty and suffering, and how his wife, Katerina Ivanovna, despite her noble background, faces destitution. The family is struggling, with their daughter Sonia resorting to prostitution to support them.

Marmeladov is grateful for the help they receive and speaks with pride about their efforts to improve their situation. He recounts how he recently regained employment and how they celebrated his return. He acknowledges that his wife Katerina tends to embellish the truth when talking about his return and promotion, but he forgives her for it. Despite their difficult circumstances, Marmeladov loves his family deeply and finds solace and love in their presence. He becomes emotional as he shares the challenges they face, including his own mistakes, such as stealing money from Katerina. He describes how he went to see Sonia, their daughter, and received money from her, which he spent on alcohol.

Marmeladov speaks of the pity he seeks and how he believes God will forgive them all for their misfortunes and sins. As they arrive at Katerina Ivanovna's room, she confronts Marmeladov about the missing money and his appearance. The children in the room are hungry and distressed due to their dire situation. After witnessing this scene, Raskolnikov leaves and later regrets not taking back the money he left for Sonia's rouge. His mind is in turmoil, contemplating whether humanity is inherently flawed or if society's perceptions create artificial barriers.

The following day, Raskolnikov wakes up late, in a foul mood, and surrounded by his small, shabby, and disorderly room. He has withdrawn from society and is troubled in mind. His landlady has stopped sending him meals, but he does not complain. He has a friendly conversation with the cook, Nastasia. Raskolnikov contemplates various ways to make money but remains unsuccessful. He receives a letter from his mother, updating him on his sister Dunia's troubles as a governess and her upcoming marriage to Peter Petrovich Luzhin.

Pulcheria, Raskolnikov's mother, expresses concern about his well-being and hopes he still believes in God. The letter deeply affects Raskolnikov, and he ventures out, lost in thought and seemingly talking to himself aloud, leading others to think he may be intoxicated. Raskolnikov encounters a drunken young girl on the street, and he intervenes to protect her from a suspicious man. He later regrets giving money to a policeman to help the girl and questions the extent of his right to interfere. This incident leads him to reflect on the tragic fate of vulnerable girls like the one he encountered, and he feels helpless in the face of societal injustices.

Raskolnikov recalls his friendship with Razumikhin, a rare friend from his university days. Razumikhin's amiable nature and popularity among comrades contrast Raskolnikov's own distance from others. Despite their differences, Razumikhin's genuine and simple character has always been a source of comfort to Raskolnikov. Raskolnikov contemplates going to Razumikhin's for work or lessons but ultimately dismisses the idea. He remembers a disturbing dream involving a scene of cruelty towards a horse, after which he resolves to renounce his dark thoughts.

While crossing the Haymarket, Raskolnikov spots Lizaveta, the sister of the old pawnbroker. He overhears a huckster and his wife discussing their plans for Lizaveta to visit the pawnbroker's house the next day when she'll be alone. The opportunity strikes Raskolnikov, and he feels a sense of destiny guiding his actions. He decides to proceed with his plan and heads back home, convinced that everything is irrevocably decided, leaving him with no freedom of thought or will.

Raskolnikov learns that Lizaveta was invited by the huckster and his wife to buy their household goods and clothes for selling. Lizaveta runs a commission business and is known for being honest and fair with her clients. Raskolnikov has been feeling superstitious lately and notices strange coincidences around him. He recalls a conversation he overheard at the pawnbroker's house, where a student spoke critically of Aliona Ivanovna, suggesting that her money could be put to better use to help people. This idea, combined with Raskolnikov's growing sense of desperation, leads him to contemplate committing a crime that he believes would benefit society.


## PART TWO

The day had broken, and Raskolnikov suddenly woke up in a panic. He noticed bloodstains on his clothes but found no other evidence of his actions from the previous night. Hiding the stolen items in a hole in the wall, he received a summons to the police station for an unpaid debt. Thankfully, the debt issue was not as serious as he had feared. At the police station, he overheard an argument between the assistant superintendent and a distressed lady, who shared a recent disturbance at her house involving him.

Raskolnikov, a literary man and author, was known to cause scandals by not paying his debts and using disgraceful language. Luise Ivanovna, his landlady, was angry with him for not settling his debts and taking lessons. He explained that he had lived with her for three years and promised to marry her daughter, who had since passed away. The police officers discussed a murder case involving Raskolnikov, causing him to faint in the police office and leave, fearing suspicion.

Anxious and paranoid, Raskolnikov thought someone might be searching for him. Finding hidden items in his room, he decided to bury them near a courtyard. Feeling a mixture of joy and relief, he visited his friend Razumikhin but left abruptly without taking up a translation job. As he walked on the Nikolaevsky Bridge, he experienced strange feelings of familiarity and disconnection from his past.

Later, he heard a violent altercation between his landlady and a man named Ilia Petrovich, leaving him in extreme anxiety. Nastasia, his servant, offered some food and suggested that fever and blood in his ears might be causing his distress. Raskolnikov passed out after taking a sip of water.

Raskolnikov was ill and delirious, sometimes half-conscious. Nastasia and Razumikhin were taking care of him, and his friend visited him frequently. He received a gift from the office and signed an I.O.U. in a weak state. Wanting to escape and leave his current place of stay, he took some beer to calm his nerves.

Razumikhin returned with items, including new clothes, but Raskolnikov seemed uninterested. Zossimov, a familiar-looking man, entered the room, and Razumikhin updated him on Raskolnikov's condition. Raskolnikov showed signs of distress upon hearing about a murder case involving a house-painter named Nikolai.

Zametov, the head clerk, joined Raskolnikov at a restaurant, and they discussed criminals and murders. Raskolnikov hinted at the possibility of committing a crime and left the restaurant. He bumped into Razumikhin, and they argued about his behavior.

Feeling apathetic and depressed, Raskolnikov witnessed a woman attempting to drown herself. He then went to the apartment where the murders took place and talked to the workmen there. After a confrontation with the porters, he decided to go to the police station.

On the way, a man was run over by a carriage, and Raskolnikov recognized him as Marmeladov, a drunkard he had known before. He offered to pay for medical help and assisted in carrying Marmeladov to his apartment. There, he met Marmeladov's family and gave them money for the funeral expenses.

Later, Raskolnikov was overtaken by a priest and a little girl named Polenka, who delivered a message from Sonia, his sister. He found joy in Polenka's presence and asked her to pray for him. With a newfound resolve, he met Razumikhin, who informed him about Zametov's suspicions of his mental state.

Emotional and discussing a deathbed scene and a flame-colored feather, Raskolnikov encountered his mother and sister, concerned about his health. Overwhelmed, he fainted, but Razumikhin reassured them that he was fine.


## PART THREE

Raskolnikov was in an emotionally distressed and fragile state, seeking solace from his mother, Pulcheria Alexandrovna, and his sister, Avdotia Romanovna. He urged his sister to refuse the marriage proposal from Luzhin. Amidst his troubles, Razumikhin, who was infatuated with Avdotia Romanovna, brought Dr. Zossimov to examine Raskolnikov's condition and reassure them about his health. Although Zossimov was impressed with Avdotia Romanovna's beauty, he maintained a professional demeanor.

Raskolnikov's illness was attributed, in part, to both material and moral influences, and his family's presence was believed to aid in his recovery. However, a small dispute arose when Razumikhin became angry at Zossimov's comment about Avdotia Romanovna. Eventually, Razumikhin and Zossimov left, and as they walked together, Razumikhin criticized Raskolnikov for being feeble, capricious, and indulgent, warning him against becoming lazy and careless.

Razumikhin tried to persuade Raskolnikov to spend the night in the landlady's apartment to get to know her better. It seemed Razumikhin was interested in the landlady and wanted Raskolnikov to keep her company, claiming that they were made for each other and destined to be together. He described the landlady's apartment as a haven with pleasant things like featherbeds and warm shawls, which piqued Raskolnikov's interest.

Later, Razumikhin woke up troubled and serious, regretting his drunken behavior and being judgmental towards the young girl's fiancé. He was concerned about Raskolnikov's character and moodiness. Meanwhile, Pulcheria Alexandrovna and Avdotia Romanovna were worried about Raskolnikov's upcoming meeting with Luzhin. They discussed Luzhin's letter, which requested Raskolnikov not to be present during their meeting and mentioned a suspicious incident involving a drunkard's daughter and money.

The ladies planned to visit Raskolnikov to discuss the situation further. As they reached the fourth floor, they noticed a room with its door open a tiny crack, and inside, they saw two keen black eyes watching them. However, the door was slammed shut abruptly as their eyes met.

Later, Zossimov arrived and found Raskolnikov in a better condition than before. Raskolnikov seemed pale, listless, and somber, showing signs of physical pain, possibly due to his recent illness. They discussed Raskolnikov's recovery, and Zossimov suggested that it depended on himself, advising him to have an occupation and a definite aim in life. The conversation also touched upon Raskolnikov's university days and potential causes of his derangement.

Pulcheria Alexandrovna thanked Zossimov for visiting them the previous night. Raskolnikov, feeling puzzled, didn't understand why Zossimov and Razumikhin were showing him such special attention. The conversation then shifted to discussing Marfa Petrovna's death, who was abused by Svidrigailov, and Raskolnikov's former love, followed by his decision to oppose his sister's marriage to Luzhin.

Dunia defended her decision to marry Luzhin, explaining she chose the lesser of two evils and wanted to be useful to her family. This led to a tense exchange between Raskolnikov and Dunia regarding her reasons for marrying Luzhin. Raskolnikov analyzed Peter Petrovich's letter, criticizing its uneducated language and warning Dunia about Luzhin's slanderous comments.

Despite their disagreements, Dunia decided to invite Raskolnikov to an important evening meeting with Peter Petrovich, and he agreed to attend. Razumikhin was also invited to the meeting, and Pulcheria Alexandrovna felt relieved to have the whole truth out in the open.

The story then introduced Sofia Semionovna Marmeladov, who entered the room timid and scared, informing Raskolnikov about Katerina Ivanovna's request for him to be at the service in the morning and the funeral lunch, to which Raskolnikov agreed and invited Razumikhin as well.

As Raskolnikov and Razumikhin walked outside, they encountered a stranger following Sofia home. Raskolnikov felt anxious about meeting Porfiry, concerned about whether he was aware of his presence at the old woman's apartment. Razumikhin teased Raskolnikov about his nervousness and excitement before entering Porfiry's apartment.

When they entered, Raskolnikov struggled to contain his laughter, and Razumikhin appeared awkward and crestfallen after some incident. Raskolnikov introduced himself to Porfiry Petrovich and explained that he had a matter to settle regarding some items that belonged to him and were in the pawnbroker's possession.

Porfiry suggested that Raskolnikov should provide information about the items and offered alternative ways to claim them. The conversation then turned to a discussion about crime and the social environment, with Razumikhin becoming passionate in his arguments against the idea that crime was solely a product of environment.

Porfiry recalled reading an article by Raskolnikov on crime and conscience, and they delved into a deeper conversation about whether some individuals might feel justified in committing crimes for a greater purpose. Raskolnikov mentioned historical figures who had done so and clarified that he believed extraordinary individuals might sometimes have the right to break the law for the greater good.

As the discussion continued, Raskolnikov elaborated on his belief that society could be divided into two categories: material, ordinary people and those with the talent to produce something new. He argued that the crimes of extraordinary people might be justified in their conscience based on the ideas they pursued.

Porfiry questioned Raskolnikov about whether he had seen painters in the apartment on the day of the murder, to which Raskolnikov recalled seeing porters moving furniture but couldn't remember any painters. Later, as Raskolnikov reflected on his actions and feelings of guilt, he encountered Svidrigailov, a strange man who entered his room without permission and introduced himself in a calm and nonchalant manner.

## PART FOUR

As Raskolnikov remembered the scene with Porfiry Petrovich and Nikolai after the murder, he couldn't help feeling a mix of relief and anxiety. Nikolai, looking pale and distressed, had confessed to being the murderer of Aliona and Lizaveta Ivanovna with an axe. Porfiry seemed annoyed by Nikolai's premature confession and wanted to question him further.

Despite the unsettling events, Raskolnikov made plans to attend Katerina Ivanovna's memorial dinner to see Sonia. He needed a distraction from the ongoing turmoil. However, his peace was short-lived as the man from the previous day, who had been looking for him, appeared again. This man confessed to having evil thoughts about Raskolnikov and reported to Porfiry about his visit to the police station and the bloodstains.

Even with this unexpected turn of events, Raskolnikov realized that Porfiry had no substantial evidence against him. He began feeling a bit more confident about facing the situation. However, he knew that the danger was still imminent, and he couldn't afford to let his guard down.

Feeling unsettled and unwell, Raskolnikov decided to seek solitude and parted ways with his family. He sought solace by visiting Sonia's house, where he found her agitated and frightened by his unexpected presence. As he observed her humble living conditions, Raskolnikov couldn't help but feel sympathy for her.

During their conversation, Sonia revealed her deep faith in God and how she believed He would protect and guide her. Raskolnikov noticed a New Testament on her chest of drawers and asked her to read the story of Lazarus. Sonia reluctantly complied, but as she read, her emotions intensified, and Raskolnikov realized that reading the Bible was her secret treasure, something she had kept to herself for a long time.

As their conversation deepened, Raskolnikov felt a connection to Sonia, sensing her genuine feelings and beliefs, even though he struggled to understand her situation fully. He decided to share with her his recent actions, breaking ties with his family, and seeking solace in her presence.

Raskolnikov confided in Sonia that he knew who killed Lizaveta, intending to reveal it to her the next day. This revelation left Sonia shocked and disturbed, but she also felt sympathy for him. Unbeknownst to them, Mr. Svidrigailov had been eavesdropping on their conversation, finding it interesting enough to listen in on their future interactions.

Later on, Raskolnikov visited the investigation department, where he encountered Porfiry Petrovich, the investigator. Raskolnikov felt intense hatred and fear towards Porfiry, suspecting that he might be trying to trap him. As they engaged in conversation, Raskolnikov challenged Porfiry's intentions, accusing him of trying to make him betray himself.

The situation escalated as Porfiry hinted at a locked door and claimed to have someone locked behind it as a surprise. Raskolnikov became increasingly agitated, feeling that Porfiry was conspiring against him. The chapter ended on a cliffhanger, leaving the reader wondering about the unfolding events and Raskolnikov's fate.

## PART FIVE

The morning after the interview with Dunia and her mother, Peter Petrovich accepted the reality of the situation. However, he was upset about his wounded vanity and checked himself in the mirror, fearing he had jaundice. He regretted telling Andrei Semionovich about the interview and held it against him. Moreover, he faced unpleasantness with legal cases and financial matters related to his approaching marriage. Peter Petrovich regretted not giving Dunia and her family money and realized it was a mistake to be stingy.

Amidst the turmoil, he was also irritated by the preparations for Katerina Ivanovna's funeral dinner and didn't plan to attend. Peter Petrovich had a particular interest in the tenants and their activities, particularly Raskolnikov. He had conflicting feelings about Andrei Semionovich, whom he both despised and feared. Furthermore, Peter Petrovich was involved in progressive circles and wanted to know if they posed any threat to him.

During a conversation with Lebeziatnikov, he expressed his desire to help Katerina Ivanovna and her family by starting a subscription or a lottery for her benefit. However, he suggested that the money should not be given directly to Katerina Ivanovna, as she had spent money on luxuries like rum, Madeira, and coffee. Sonia was emotional and grateful for the offer of help, and Peter Petrovich gave her a ten-ruble note. Lebeziatnikov admired Peter Petrovich's actions and praised him for his compassion despite not agreeing with private charity. He also shared his views on free marriage during their conversation.

In the midst of this, Peter Petrovich wanted to see Sonia to discuss something with her before he left. Sonia was shy and overwhelmed in his presence. As he tried to talk to her privately, Raskolnikov entered the room. Peter Petrovich wanted to speak with Sonia alone and asked Lebeziatnikov to stay with them.

Peter Petrovich apologized for not attending Katerina Ivanovna's dinner due to "inevitable circumstances" and expressed his desire to help her by starting a subscription or a lottery for her benefit. The dinner had been a chaotic affair, with arguments and tensions rising among the guests. Amalia Ivanovna and Katerina Ivanovna had a heated argument that led to Katerina Ivanovna being thrown out of the lodgings.

Later, Raskolnikov confided in Sonia about his crime, revealing that he had killed Lizaveta accidentally while intending to murder the old pawnbroker. Sonia advised him to confess his crime publicly. Amidst all this, Katerina Ivanovna's health rapidly declined, and she eventually died, leaving Sonia and Polenka in grief.

Svidrigailov offered to take care of the funeral and financial matters for the children, leading to Raskolnikov questioning his motives. Svidrigailov revealed that he had been observing Raskolnikov and found him interesting, hinting at a possible friendship. The events continued to unfold, leaving the characters in a web of emotions and actions.

## PART SIX

Raskolnikov was going through a strange period, feeling foggy and isolated, haunted by the belief that his mind was clouded and he had made grave mistakes during this time. His thoughts were preoccupied with Svidrigailov, and he couldn't shake the worry surrounding him. Raskolnikov had met Svidrigailov a few times, and they had agreed not to discuss a certain vital subject.

Amidst this turmoil, Raskolnikov attended Katerina Ivanovna's funeral, but his mind was preoccupied with other thoughts, and he felt uneasy, unable to find solace in solitude. Soon, Razumikhin visited Raskolnikov and accused him of being mad. He mentioned that Dunia had come to see Raskolnikov and became upset after receiving a letter. Furthermore, Razumikhin revealed that the murderer of the old woman had been caught, adding to Raskolnikov's troubled state.

Raskolnikov found himself deep in thought about Porfiry's actions and contemplated confronting Svidrigailov. Unexpectedly, Porfiry paid him a visit, leaving Raskolnikov startled and on guard. During their conversation, Porfiry shared his concerns about Raskolnikov being the murderer, and Raskolnikov initially denied it. However, as Porfiry tried to persuade him to confess, Raskolnikov's resolve wavered, and he showed signs of doubt and despair.

Porfiry urged Raskolnikov not to disdain life and to seek faith or God. He advised him to embrace life without fear and with a good heart. Porfiry believed that Raskolnikov should be thankful for not committing a worse crime and encouraged him to fulfill the demands of justice. Raskolnikov, however, remained reluctant to confess.

After Porfiry left, Raskolnikov hurried to Svidrigailov's place, feeling morally fatigued and anxious about his future. He confronted Svidrigailov about his intentions with Dunia and became disgusted with Svidrigailov's behavior, finding him repulsive.

Svidrigailov then recounted a disturbing story about his past, revealing his complicated relationships with Marfa Petrovna and Dunia. Raskolnikov, suspicious of Svidrigailov's motives, decided to follow him. During their argument, Svidrigailov offered to help Raskolnikov and claimed to have evidence of his guilt.

Later, Svidrigailov encountered a neglected little girl in a hotel and took care of her before experiencing disturbing dreams. His inner turmoil reached a breaking point as he contemplated suicide. Ultimately, he ended his life with a revolver.

In the midst of all this, Raskolnikov confessed the truth about the murder to his mother and sister Dunia, who were both horrified but remained supportive. He also sought Sonia's cross, contemplating going to prison and confessing his crime.

In a state of emotional turmoil, Raskolnikov finally confessed to Ilia Petrovich that he was the one who killed the pawnbroker and her sister, revealing the truth at last.


## EPILOGUE


The story unfolds in Siberia, within a town that houses both a fortress and a prison. The central character, Rodion Raskolnikov, finds himself serving as a second-class convict, having spent nine months behind bars after committing a crime. During his trial, Raskolnikov confessed to all the details of the murder, but his behavior puzzled the lawyers and judges. They were confounded by his actions of hiding the stolen items and his apparent ignorance of their value. The conclusion drawn was that he might have been suffering from temporary mental derangement during the commission of the crime.

Raskolnikov disclosed that his motive for the act was rooted in poverty, driven by a desire to use the stolen money to improve his life. Consequently, he received a sentence of eight years of penal servitude, with extenuating circumstances taken into account. Tragically, during the trial, his mother, Pulcheria Alexandrovna, fell ill and eventually passed away. Meanwhile, Raskolnikov's sister, Dunia, married a determined man named Razumikhin, who actively planned their future together in Siberia.

Throughout his incarceration, Sonia, a deeply connected figure in Raskolnikov's life, continued to correspond with the Razumikhins, sharing updates about his life in prison. Raskolnikov's demeanor behind bars was sullen and indifferent, though he managed to maintain his health and accept the harsh conditions. Unfortunately, his fellow prisoners despised him, and at one point, he fell seriously ill, landing him in the convict ward of the prison hospital.

Despite the hardships, the physical toll, and the isolation, Raskolnikov's spirit remained unbroken. He found solace in the demanding physical labor, which left him physically exhausted but granted a few hours of peaceful sleep. The deplorable food and prison attire meant little to him, as he had endured worse in his past. Neither the chains nor his shaven head filled him with shame, except when it came to seeing Sonia, to whom he often displayed a rough and contemptuous manner.

However, his true suffering was born of wounded pride. It wasn't the crime itself that plagued him, for he saw it as a legal crime by the letter of the law. Rather, it was his failed attempt at executing the deed that bruised his ego. Raskolnikov relentlessly judged himself, seeking a fault in his past that would justify his fate. Alas, he found no particularly terrible fault, only a simple blunder that anyone might have made.

Despite his turmoil, Raskolnikov did not repent of his crime. He questioned why he did not end his own life instead of confessing and wondered if it was due to the strong desire to live. He pondered whether his instinctive will to survive was a sign of fundamental falsity within himself and his convictions. Perhaps, unbeknownst to him, his consciousness held the promise of a future crisis that could lead to a new perspective on life, offering the hope of a rebirth.

In prison, Raskolnikov observed the stark contrast between himself and his fellow inmates. He felt alienated, perceived as a different species, and met with distrust and hostility. Even among the prisoners who had committed more severe offenses, his crime was considered horrific. They viewed him as a gentleman who shouldn't have resorted to such crude violence. The disdain from his peers weighed heavily on him, leaving him with a profound sense of isolation.

Yet, amidst the despair, Sonia remained a beacon of light. Surprisingly, she was well-regarded by the other prisoners, although she had done little to earn their affection. She continued to visit Raskolnikov during his work and became a symbol of goodness and compassion to them. They admired her deeply and sought her assistance, and in return, she offered them small acts of kindness.

One fateful day, Raskolnikov's life took an unexpected turn when Sonia visited him in the hospital ward. In a moment of intense emotion, he fell at her feet, and they both realized the depth of their feelings for each other. Despite the difficult circumstances and the seven more years they had to wait for a full life together, they were overwhelmed with happiness, knowing that they had found true love.

As Raskolnikov recovered from his illness, he often thought of Sonia and the possibility of a new life. He kept a New Testament under his pillow, a book that belonged to her, and contemplated whether her convictions and feelings could align with his own. Their love seemed to be the catalyst for a gradual transformation, a regeneration, and he yearned for the moment when they could be together, free from the shackles of the past.

In this way, their story concludes with hope and anticipation. The path ahead would undoubtedly be fraught with great striving and suffering, but they were willing to endure it all for the promise of a renewed and meaningful life.
