## Individual Rethinking

In a rapidly changing world, the ability to rethink is essential, yet people often stick to their beliefs and opinions. The pace of knowledge and information is increasing, necessitating a willingness to question our beliefs more readily. The mindset of preachers, prosecutors, and politicians can hinder our ability to rethink, while scientists possess a unique perspective that involves doubt, curiosity, and updating views based on new data. Teaching scientific thinking to entrepreneurs has resulted in more successful businesses, as great leaders exhibit traits of intellectual curiosity and openness, which contribute to their success. Overconfidence and resistance to change can lead to flawed thinking while rethinking opens our minds to new possibilities.

Mike Lazaridis, the creator of the BlackBerry smartphone, initially thought like a scientist but struggled to rethink as a CEO, leading to the downfall of BlackBerry. A higher IQ does not guarantee the ability to change one's mind or update beliefs, as even math geniuses can exhibit confirmation bias and resist analysing contradictory data. Preaching, prosecuting, and politicking mental modes hinder rethinking, while the scientist mode fosters mental agility. The curse of knowledge can close our minds, but rethinking opens them, allowing us to embrace new opportunities and overcome resistance to change.

Cultivating the habit of rethinking and being open to revising our beliefs is crucial in navigating the complexities of life. Adopting a scientist's mindset, characterised by doubt, curiosity, and a willingness to adjust views based on evidence, can help us adapt to a rapidly changing world. By avoiding the mental traps of preaching, prosecuting, and politicking, we can develop intellectual curiosity and openness, contributing to personal growth and success. Rethinking enables us to overcome overconfidence, embrace new possibilities, and seize opportunities for positive change.

### The Armchair Quarterback and the Impostor: Finding the Sweet Spot of Confidence

In this part, we also discussed the concepts of blind spots and overconfidence in our knowledge and abilities. Blindness to our blindness, known as Anton's syndrome, can lead to a deficit in self-awareness. Armchair quarterback syndrome and impostor syndrome are discussed as situations where confidence and competence are imbalanced, with the former exhibiting overconfidence and lacking confidence. The Dunning-Kruger effect is introduced, highlighting that people with lower competence often have inflated beliefs in their abilities.

Overconfidence and blind spots can hinder rethinking by creating false confidence in our knowledge and skills. Lacking metacognitive skills can leave us blind to our incompetence. The ideal belief state is confident humility, where we have faith in our capability but remain open to questioning our methods. Doubt and impostor syndrome can be beneficial by motivating us to work harder, encouraging us to work smarter by reevaluating our strategies and making us better learners. Embracing uncertainty and impostor syndrome primes us to ask questions, absorb new ideas, and protect against the adverse effects of overconfidence.

Confident humility and a willingness to learn contributed to the success of Halla Tómasdóttir in the presidential election, as she worked harder, rethought her campaign strategies, and sought advice and feedback from others. Great thinkers maintain doubts to improve their understanding and knowledge, recognising there is always more to learn. Arrogance blinds us to our weaknesses, while humility and confident humility enable us to overcome them and continue growing.

### The Joy of Being Wrong: The Thrill of Not Believing Everything You Think

This part also explores embracing the joy of being wrong and not believing everything we think. The inner dictator, our ego, seeks to protect our self-image and core beliefs by filtering out threatening information. However, we have control over our thoughts and should be open to rethinking them, as evidence shows we are often wrong. Detaching from our past selves and separating opinions from identity enables growth and flexibility in updating our practices based on new evidence.

Individuals comfortable with being wrong, such as top election forecasters and Nobel Prize-winning scientists, enjoy discovering their mistakes. They excel in updating their beliefs and have confidence in their predictions while doubting and revising their false prophecies. The key driver of their success is the frequency of updating ideas and engaging in rethinking cycles. Having a long-term time horizon focus and being open to short-term stumbling and rerouting are traits of great scientists and super forecasters.

Admitting when we are wrong displays honesty, and a willingness to learn doesn't diminish our competence. Our responsibility is to ground opinions in logic and facts, share our reasoning, and change our minds when better evidence emerges. Embracing challenges to our ideas and viewing them as opportunities for development and evolution leads to more graceful and accepting responses. The case of Ted Kaczynski highlights the dangers of unwavering conviction and the consequences of not questioning our opinions.

### The Good Fight Club: The Psychology of Constructive Conflict

Successful collaborations often stem from solid bonds and a lack of rivalries, such as the relationship between the Wright brothers or the chemistry among comedic duos like Fey and Poehler. Conflict can be divided into relationship conflict and task conflict, with the former being detrimental to performance and the latter having positive outcomes for creativity and decision-making. Disagreeable individuals who challenge the status quo contribute to innovation, as seen in Pixar's success with "The Incredibles." Building challenge networks and promoting constructive conflict within organisations can foster critical thinking and growth.

Constructive arguments and conflicts are crucial for growth, learning, and producing better outcomes. However, it's essential to ensure that diverse perspectives are heard, and that newcomers and less assertive individuals feel comfortable expressing their ideas. Agreeableness should focus on seeking social harmony rather than cognitive consensus, allowing for disagreements without disagreement. The Wright brothers exemplified intense task conflict without relationship conflict, viewing arguments as opportunities to test and refine their thinking. Framing disputes as debates and focusing on "how" instead of "why" can activate rethinking cycles and lead to new insights and solutions. Approaching task conflict with a scientific mindset propels thinking forward and encourages curiosity and openness to alternative options.

## Interpersonal Rethinking

### Dances with Foes: How to Win Debates and Influence People

In a debate between Harish Natarajan and eight-year-old Debra Jo Prectet on subsidising preschools, both debaters present strong arguments that cause the audience to reconsider their positions. Harish skillfully uses negotiation tactics such as finding common ground, giving fewer reasons, and asking thought-provoking questions to sway the audience's opinion. The debate highlights the collaborative nature of effective persuasion and the importance of remaining open to learning and thinking like scientists.

The debate also emphasises the value of humility, curiosity, and adaptability in convincing others to reconsider their opinions. Harish establishes common ground with Debra, acknowledges valid points from the opposing side, and focuses on several compelling reasons. Asking individuals to contemplate their reasons for a particular viewpoint can be more persuasive than providing declarative statements. However, some individuals may be deeply attached to their beliefs and require different approaches to engage in productive dialogue.

The importance of approaching arguments as a dance is emphasised, where both sides consider the most potent version of the opponent's perspective and focus on the most compelling points. Expressing less conviction and acknowledging weaknesses can be persuasive, inviting the audience to think for themselves and fostering a more nuanced discussion. Engaging in curiosity and asking questions can invite the audience to join as partners in the conversation, encouraging openness and understanding.

### Bad Blood on the Diamond: Diminishing Prejudice by Destabilizing Stereotypes

A Black musician, Daryl Davis, engages in conversations with white supremacists to challenge their beliefs and has successfully led some individuals to leave hate groups. The author reflects on the power of dialogue and understanding in diminishing prejudice and stereotypes. Rivalries, such as between Red Sox and Yankees fans, can intensify contempt and stereotypes. Opening fans' minds from rival teams by recognising the complexity of their beliefs did not significantly change their attitudes. However, reflecting on the arbitrariness of animosity and considering counterfactual thinking led to decreased hostility and varied views.

The experiments conducted with passionate Yankees and Red Sox fans demonstrated that humanising individuals from rival groups may change attitudes toward them, but stereotypes of the group remain unchanged. However, fans who reflected on the arbitrariness of their stereotypes showed a decrease in sabotage and a willingness to support the rival team. Counterfactual thinking, imagining different circumstances and beliefs, can help people question their stereotypes and prejudices. Interacting with members of another group in person can reduce bias in the majority of cases, according to studies.

Daryl Davis' approach involves planting seeds of doubt and curiosity in conversations with white supremacists, challenging their beliefs, and emphasising common identity and shared interests. He advocates for dialogue and education as catalysts for systemic change and urges individuals to rethink their assumptions. Many former white supremacists have transformed into educators after reconsidering their ideas.

### Vaccine Whisperers and Mild-Mannered Interrogators: How the Right Kind of Listening Motivates People to Change

Marie-Hélène Étienne-Rousseau, initially hesitant to vaccinate her children due to community beliefs, was persuaded to reconsider through motivational interviewing techniques used by Arnaud Gagneur, a vaccine whisperer. Motivational interviewing, developed by Bill Miller, focuses on finding an individual's motivation to change by asking open-ended questions, engaging in reflective listening, and affirming their desire and ability to change. It has been successful in various areas, such as smoking cessation, substance abuse, and diet. Motivational interviewing can be applied in everyday interactions to help others explore their thoughts and motivations.

Motivational interviewing was utilised to help Jeff, a struggling biotechnology startup CEO, develop a vision for the company. The approach involved asking open-ended questions and engaging in reflective listening, leading Jeff to consider changing his leadership approach. Change talk, referencing a desire or commitment to make adjustments, is crucial in motivational interviewing. The technique requires summarising, checking for understanding, and discussing plans and next steps. The interviewer effectively guides individuals toward their goals, genuinely wanting to help them.

Listening skills have proven influential in various contexts, such as Peacemaking in Uganda by Betty Bigombe. Betty demonstrated curiosity, humility, and patience while empowering individuals to share their views and generate solutions. Effective listening can lead to more complex and less extreme attitudes in group settings. Great listeners make others feel smart and encourage them to approach their views with humility, doubt, and curiosity. Listening with empathy and respect shows care and makes others more receptive to hearing. How we change someone's mind reflects our character, and the process should be something to be proud of, not just the result.

## Collective Rethinking

### Charged Conversations: Depolarizing Our Divided Discussions

The Difficult Conversations Lab at Columbia University aims to foster understanding and consensus by facilitating discussions on controversial topics. They promote productive conversations by presenting polarising issues as complex problems with multiple viewpoints. Simplifying complex issues into binary categories, known as binary bias, hinders open-mindedness and fuels polarisation. Overconfidence can be disrupted by showcasing a range of perspectives and complexifying issues, and rethinking can be spurred.

While the internet can potentially expose us to different views, being exposed to diverse perspectives does not necessarily change our minds. The complexity and nuance in discussions are needed for better understanding. Seeking and spotlighting shades of grey in conversations helps combat desirability bias and engages people with diverse beliefs. Acknowledging complexity as a signal of credibility and favouring content that presents multiple sides of an issue can promote better understanding and meaningful conversations.

Presenting solutions to complex issues can shift the focus from the problem to actionable steps, reducing polarisation. Highlighting the "how" of addressing a problem fosters more constructive discussions about solutions. Scientists often include caveats in their communication to acknowledge the limitations and uncertainties of their studies, which keeps readers' minds open. Conveying complexity involves highlighting contingencies and accepting the conditions under which specific effects may change. Recognising the complexities of racism and embracing nuance and complexity can lead to deeper discussions, mutual understanding, and progress.

### Rewriting the Textbook: Teaching Students to Question Knowledge

A social studies teacher, Erin McCarthy, challenges her students by using an outdated history textbook and encouraging them to question its inaccuracies and omissions. She fosters curiosity and teaches her students that knowledge is constantly evolving. McCarthy engages her students in inquiry-based learning, encouraging them to critically examine historical events and rewrite textbook chapters with underrepresented perspectives. This approach promotes critical thinking skills and the understanding that there isn't always a single correct answer.

In education, there is a movement towards promoting critical thinking and questioning. Teaching students to think like fact-checkers and interrogate information helps develop their thinking skills. Active learning methods, such as group problem-solving and tutorials, are more effective than traditional lecturing. While lectures can be entertaining and informative, they may not facilitate dialogue, disagreement, or more profound understanding. The "dumbstruck effect" refers to captivating addresses that fail to teach students how to think for themselves. Thus, lectures should complement active learning and student-centred methods to foster independent thought and lifelong learning.

Rethinking skills and opportunities for questioning and critical examination should be integrated throughout education. Providing assignments that challenge conventional wisdom and promote inquiry and critical analysis can teach students the importance of rethinking. Learning methods like simulations and problem-solving activities promote more profound understanding and engagement. Embracing confusion as an opportunity for learning and creating an environment where revision is encouraged is crucial for fostering rethinking. Teachers can adopt principles such as introducing new ways of thinking, expressing humility, fostering curiosity, and promoting the joy of discovery to cultivate a classroom environment that supports continuous revision and lifelong learning.

### That’s Not the Way We’ve Always Done It: Building Cultures of Learning at Work

Luca Parmitano, an astronaut, encountered a life-threatening situation during a spacewalk because he failed to rethink his faulty assumptions. NASA's history of failures, such as the Challenger and Columbia disasters, can be attributed to a lack of rethinking caused by complacency, a performance-oriented culture, and a lack of psychological safety. Psychological safety, characterised by trust, respect, and openness, is crucial for fostering a learning culture that encourages rethinking. It does not mean relaxing standards or avoiding accountability but creating an environment where individuals can voice concerns and suggestions without fear of retaliation.

Establishing psychological safety in the workplace can be challenging but is essential for encouraging rethinking and continuous learning. An astronaut and NASA leader, Ellen Ochoa, actively promoted psychological safety by challenging assumptions and asking probing questions. Questioning assumptions and asking, "How do you know?" are essential in fostering a rethinking culture. The Gates Foundation recognised the need for psychological safety to encourage risk-taking and bold experimentation. Traditional feedback approaches did not sustain psychological safety, but managers sharing their experiences receiving feedback and their development goals had a lasting impact. Creating an environment where leaders openly react to criticisms and share their imperfections fosters psychological safety and promotes learning.

However, psychological safety should be combined with process accountability to create a comprehensive learning culture. Solely focusing on results and best practices can hinder long-term learning and improvement. Process accountability involves evaluating decision-making processes, encouraging deep thinking, and considering alternatives. Separating decision makers from decision evaluators and cultivating a learning mindset is vital to building a rethinking culture. NASA's shift toward a learning culture resulted in improved safety measures, open communication, and reevaluation of decisions. Rethinking and process accountability prevent regrettable outcomes and promote continuous improvement.

## Conclusion

### Escaping Tunnel Vision: Reconsidering Our Best-Laid Career and Life Plans

Tunnel vision and the escalation of commitment can prevent us from reconsidering our career and life plans. Although valuable for long-term goals, the concept of grit can also lead to stubbornness and hinder reevaluation. Identity foreclosure, settling on a fixed sense of self without exploration, can limit our options. Encouraging children to view work as actions rather than fixed identities can maintain their enthusiasm and openness to different career paths. Regular checkups on our life plans can help us avoid foreclosure and embrace growth.

Seduction by status, overconfidence, and validation-seeking can trap us in unfulfilling career paths and hinder reevaluation. Placing too much importance on individual happiness can distract from experiencing joy and overlook the significance of purpose and meaning. Rethinking how we spend our time and creating meaningful connections can lead to greater fulfilment. Focusing on contribution and harmony rather than happiness can lead to a more fulfilling life.

Recognising that careers, relationships, and communities are open systems with multiple paths and destinations, we should avoid getting too attached to a specific route or definition of success. Job crafting allows individuals to shape their roles to better align with their values, interests, and skills. Rethinking and adjusting our plans can bring new meaning and fulfilment without completely upending our paths. Embracing humility, doubt, and curiosity is essential for reviewing and leading a more fulfilling life.-
