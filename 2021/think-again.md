## Individual Rethinking
### A Preacher, a Prosecutor, a Politician, and a Scientist Walk into Your Mind

Mike Lazaridis, an electronics wizard, left an indelible mark on the world with his groundbreaking inventions. He first patented a device for reading bar codes on movie film, showcasing his innovative prowess. Later, he revolutionized the mobile industry with the invention of the BlackBerry, a device that quickly gained immense popularity.

However, despite initial success, the BlackBerry's market share gradually declined over time. This was partly due to Mike's struggles with rethinking and adapting to a rapidly changing world. In today's fast-paced environment, rethinking is crucial, but most individuals tend to cling to their established beliefs and opinions.

The continuous advances in information and technology have led to a constant flow of new knowledge, necessitating more frequent questioning of our assumptions. Unfortunately, people often find themselves falling into three mental modes: preacher, prosecutor, and politician, all of which hinder the capacity for rethinking.

Contrasting these modes is the scientist mindset, characterized by a commitment to questioning, experimentation, and updating views based on evidence. This approach can lead to smarter choices and better outcomes in various domains.

Teaching entrepreneurs to think like scientists has yielded remarkable results, with higher revenue and quicker customer attraction for their startups. Flexibility and the ability to change one's mind are increasingly valued traits, even for successful leaders and scientists.

While Mike Lazaridis initially succeeded in thinking like a scientist during the rise of BlackBerry, he faltered as a CEO when faced with the iPhone's introduction. He struggled to adapt, resisting adding an internet browser and instant messaging to the device, missing out on valuable opportunities for growth.

Research has shown that high IQ individuals might struggle to update their beliefs, falling prey to confirmation and desirability biases. The scientist mindset, on the other hand, requires intellectual humility, doubt, curiosity, and actively open-mindedness.

Overconfidence cycles can lead to closed-mindedness, hindering effective rethinking. The story of Apple's renaissance exemplifies the importance of team efforts in rethinking, as the collective challenged Steve Jobs to change his mind about the iPhone.

Ultimately, rethinking is a vital habit in life, enabling us to evolve our beliefs and make better judgments in a dynamic and ever-changing world.

### The Armchair Quarterback and the Impostor: Finding the Sweet Spot of Confidence

Ursula Mercz's case is a fascinating example of Anton's syndrome, a condition where individuals are unaware of their physical disability due to damage in the occipital lobe of the brain. On the other end of the competence-confidence spectrum is the Dunning-Kruger effect, which reveals that those with low competence often exhibit overconfidence, while those with high competence may lack confidence in their abilities.

Halla Tómasdóttir's story exemplifies the impostor syndrome, a phenomenon where individuals doubt their abilities despite their competence. Striking the right balance in confidence is crucial, avoiding extremes like being an overconfident armchair quarterback or an underconfident impostor.

Overconfidence can be detrimental, compromising self-awareness and hindering the willingness to rethink. Developing metacognitive skills, which involve thinking about our thinking, helps in recognizing blind spots in our knowledge and competence.

The Dunning-Kruger effect can even lead to feigned knowledge, where people pretend to know things they don't, due to their inability to recognize their incompetence. Lack of metacognitive skills can make us blind to our own limitations in certain areas.

Recognizing our blind spots is essential for growth and improvement. Though everyone may experience moments of overconfidence and ignorance, being aware of these moments empowers us to rethink and strive for improvement.

The Dunning-Kruger effect is particularly likely to impact individuals as they transition from novice to amateur levels of expertise, fostering overconfidence in their abilities.

Moving from novice to amateur status can disrupt the rethinking cycle, leading to blind spots in knowledge and competence. Humility, however, does not mean having low self-confidence; rather, it involves being grounded and acknowledging our flaws and fallibility.

Confident humility represents the ideal state of confidence, where we have faith in our capabilities while recognizing that we may not have all the answers. The impostor syndrome, when channeled positively, can motivate individuals to work harder, smarter, and become better learners.

Halla Tómasdóttir's journey from self-doubt to confident humility serves as an illustration of how doubts can fuel growth and improvement. Embracing doubts and humility, great thinkers understand that the quest for knowledge is never-ending and that they can learn from everyone they encounter.

### The Joy of Being Wrong: The Thrill of Not Believing Everything You Think

In 1959, psychologist Henry Murray conducted an unethical study at Harvard, where he subjected students to attacks on their beliefs and filmed their reactions. While some participants found the experience agonizing, others seemed to enjoy having their beliefs challenged. However, the goal is not to be wrong more often but to recognize that everyone is wrong sometimes and to be more accepting of it.

The "totalitarian ego" can prevent us from rethinking our beliefs and shield us from information that threatens our views. To unlock the joy of being wrong, we need to detach from our past selves and separate our opinions from our identity. This detachment can lead to healthier mental well-being and make it easier to change our beliefs when necessary. By identifying with values rather than opinions, we become more open-minded and flexible in updating our perspectives.

Jean-Pierre Beugoms serves as an example of someone who enjoys discovering when he's wrong and participates in forecasting tournaments to predict future events. Forecasting is a systematic way of testing knowledge and making predictions about future occurrences. Forecasters are scored based on accuracy and calibration, which refers to having the right level of conviction in their predictions.

Jean-Pierre excels as an election forecaster, displaying skill in predicting political outcomes. The key factors contributing to forecasters' success are not solely based on their knowledge or intelligence, but on how often they update their beliefs and embrace new information to improve their accuracy.

The importance of rethinking is highlighted in forecasting, as the best forecasters engage in frequent reevaluation and are willing to doubt their judgments in order to enhance their accuracy. Kjirste Morrell employs a unique approach, transforming the pain of being wrong into a source of pleasure through classical conditioning.

Emotional investment in predictions can cloud judgment and hinder accurate forecasting. Therefore, detaching from emotional attachment to predictions is crucial for maintaining objectivity and achieving accurate forecasts. The fear of being wrong motivates forecasters to constantly improve and correct their mistakes, fostering personal growth and learning.

In contrast, extreme conviction and an unwillingness to consider alternative views can lead to harmful actions, as demonstrated in an excerpt from Ted Kaczynski's manifesto, the Unabomber. Thus, forecasting success relies on the ability to update beliefs frequently and embrace new information, while admitting and embracing mistakes becomes essential for personal growth and learning.

### The Good Fight Club: The Psychology of Constructive Conflict

Wilbur and Orville Wright stand as an example of brothers who collaborated harmoniously and engaged in rethinking to achieve the monumental feat of human flight. Their partnership showcased how successful innovation can be achieved without sibling rivalry, emphasizing the power of teamwork in rethinking.

Conflict can manifest in two distinct forms: relationship conflict and task conflict. Relationship conflict involves personal and emotional clashes, whereas task conflict revolves around disagreements concerning ideas and opinions. The consequences of conflict vary greatly; high levels of relationship conflict can detrimentally impact performance, while some degree of task conflict can be beneficial. Task conflict can foster higher creativity and lead to better decision-making processes.

Disagreeable individuals, characterized by their critical, skeptical, and challenging nature, play a valuable role in fostering a challenge network that encourages productive rethinking and innovation. A prime example of this is Brad Bird at Pixar, who formed a challenge network of "pirates" to push boundaries and overcome technical limitations while creating "The Incredibles."

Task conflict, with its focus on disagreements about ideas and opinions, is crucial for stimulating creativity and driving progress. Leaders are encouraged to embrace productive disagreements rather than surrounding themselves with yes-men. Disagreeable individuals are instrumental in such environments, providing tough feedback that elevates the quality of work and encourages rethinking.

Some studies have shown that people tend to avoid working with others who criticize them, leading to a preference for partners who provide praise instead. This avoidance behavior can hinder rethinking and innovation in the workplace.

Challenge networks within organizations and occupations serve as catalysts for task conflict, fostering a culture of rethinking and innovation. Pixar's "moonshot factory" and the peer-review process in scientific communities are prime examples of challenge networks in action.

Disagreeable givers within challenge networks contribute significantly by providing tough feedback and fostering task conflict, ultimately promoting rethinking and innovation. The key lies in cultivating intellectual tension rather than emotional discord within these networks.

Framing disagreements as debates about ideas, not personal conflicts, can encourage open dialogue and productive rethinking. The Wright brothers exemplify how intense task conflict can lead to breakthroughs in work without compromising their relationship.

While debates about "how" something works can encourage intellectual growth and rethinking, arguments centered on "why" can lead to emotional attachment to positions, hindering progress.

Asking individuals to explain "how" something works can reveal gaps in their knowledge, promoting curiosity and encouraging rethinking. The Wright brothers' resolution of the propeller problem through scientific rethinking exemplifies the power of such an approach in achieving major breakthroughs.

In conclusion, challenge networks, task conflict, and the value of disagreeable individuals are essential elements in fostering rethinking and driving innovation. Framing disagreements productively and focusing on "how" rather than "why" can further enhance the process of rethinking, leading to breakthrough solutions and intellectual growth.

## Interpersonal Rethinking
### Dances with Foes: How to Win Debates and Influence People

In a remarkable debate, Harish Natarajan, a world record-winning debater, squared off against Project Debater, an AI developed by IBM, personified as an eight-year-old prodigy named Debra Jo Prectet. The topic of the debate was whether preschools should be subsidized by the government. Debra presented her arguments in favor of subsidies, relying on data, studies, and a focus on the benefits for underprivileged children. On the other hand, Harish countered by arguing against subsidies, highlighting trade-offs and the allocation of resources.

What made Harish's approach particularly effective was his acknowledgment of areas of agreement with Debra, seeking common ground, and avoiding defensive or offensive tactics. The art of debate was likened to a dance, where partners adapt their moves to find harmony. Similarly, expert negotiators focus on finding common ground, presenting fewer reasons to support their case, asking questions, and avoiding defensive or offensive stances.

Project Debater demonstrated the remarkable capabilities of AI in conducting intelligent debates, utilizing vast knowledge and coherent arguments. Despite the AI's impressive skills, Harish emerged as the winner, showcasing the power of presenting a reasonable case and acknowledging areas of agreement.

Convincing others to rethink their opinions requires humility, curiosity, and openness to evolving views based on logic and data. Effective debates rely on finding common ground and presenting a coherent, reasonable case. Avoiding defensive or offensive tactics and asking questions can foster more open-mindedness in the audience.

The art of debate involves adaptability and a willingness to change one's views based on evidence. The use of AI in debates highlights the potential of technology to engage in intelligent discussions, but Harish's human touch of finding common ground gave him an edge.

Harish's practical tip for finding common ground is to consider the strongest version of the opponent's case, known as the "steel man," rather than attacking the weakest version, called the "straw man."

Piling on too many arguments can dilute the power of each, and top debaters often focus on a small number of compelling reasons. The effectiveness of preaching and prosecuting in persuasion depends on the audience's level of interest, openness to the argument, and willingness to rethink their beliefs.

The source of persuasion matters, and the most convincing source is often the one closest to the audience. Harish's success in debates is attributed to posing more questions for contemplation, leaving the audience intrigued to learn more and engage in a rethinking cycle.

When faced with hostile arguments, responding with curiosity and interest can de-escalate the situation and encourage a more nuanced discussion. Expressing opinions with some uncertainty signals confident humility and invites curiosity, making the argument more credible and persuasive.

Acknowledging weaknesses and being self-aware can positively influence others' perceptions and increase credibility. Asking questions rather than thinking for the audience invites them to join in the discussion and think for themselves, promoting a more cooperative dialogue.

### Bad Blood on the Diamond: Diminishing Prejudice by Destabilizing Stereotypes

Daryl Davis's encounter with a white supremacist proved to be a pivotal moment in his life, changing his perspective on confronting hatred and prejudice. Stereotypes and prejudice are deeply ingrained and challenging to change due to both mental and social reasons. This is exemplified in sports rivalries like Yankees vs. Red Sox, where group polarization and stereotyping intensify the "us vs. them" mentality.

The author seeks to understand how approaches like humanizing and common identity can break overconfidence cycles and foster change. Daryl Davis, a Black musician, demonstrated this approach by engaging in a conversation with a white supremacist without reacting with hostility. Instead, he chose laughter, leading to an unexpected friendship. This encounter encouraged the Klansman to leave the KKK and abandon his hatred, inspiring Davis to engage with other white supremacists and promote positive change.

Sports rivalries, like Yankees vs. Red Sox, highlight the intensity of stereotypes and prejudice. People tend to identify strongly with their own group and disidentify with their rivals, reinforcing the "us vs. them" mindset. Stereotypes are difficult to undo due to mental defenses and social interactions, especially as group polarization pushes individuals towards extreme views within their groups.

While the overview effect experienced by astronauts fosters a sense of common identity among humanity, it falls short in bridging the gap between sports rivals like Yankees and Red Sox fans. Shared love for baseball does not diminish negative views between the groups.

Humanizing techniques and peace psychology have shown some success in conflict resolution, as seen in Herb Kelman's workshops for Israeli and Palestinian leaders, fostering empathy and friendships. However, when it comes to rivalries in sports, like UNC-Duke, humanizing may change individuals' attitudes towards specific individuals but not group stereotypes.

Overcoming stereotypes and prejudice is a complex challenge that requires more research to understand the underlying mechanisms. People often cling to stereotypes about groups even when they know individuals from those groups as exceptions. Herb Kelman faced a similar problem with Israelis and Palestinians; they trusted individuals but still held onto stereotypes about the groups.

Sports team rivalries can be seen as arbitrary rituals that people adopt early in life and hold onto without questioning. However, research has shown that fans of rival baseball teams can become more sympathetic and less hostile toward each other when they reflect on the arbitrariness of their animosity.

Counterfactual thinking, imagining different circumstances, can help challenge stereotypes and prejudices, and interacting with members of another group can reduce prejudice in many cases.

In summary, Daryl Davis's experiences demonstrate the power of engaging in conversations, finding common ground, and challenging stereotypes without preaching or prosecuting to promote positive change and foster empathy and understanding. However, breaking deeply rooted stereotypes and prejudice requires continued research and efforts to understand and address the underlying complexities.

### Vaccine Whisperers and Mild-Mannered Interrogators: How the Right Kind of Listening Motivates People to Change

Vaccination rates in developed countries have been on the decline, leading to preventable disease outbreaks like measles. Traditional approaches of preaching, prosecuting, and educating people about vaccine safety have shown limited success in increasing vaccination rates. In response, motivational interviewing, a technique developed by Bill Miller and Stephen Rollnick, has emerged as a promising method to help individuals find their own motivation for change.

Motivational interviewing involves asking open-ended questions, engaging in reflective listening, and affirming the person's desire and ability to change. A neonatologist named Arnaud Gagneur successfully used motivational interviewing to help a hesitant mother, Marie-Hélène Étienne-Rousseau, overcome her resistance to vaccinating her children. Following the conversation with Arnaud, Marie-Hélène decided to vaccinate her children, demonstrating the effectiveness of this technique in increasing vaccination rates.

This approach is not limited to the medical field; motivational interviewing is used in various domains to promote behavior change and open people's minds to new possibilities. Instead of offering advice or recommendations, motivational interviewers guide individuals to self-discovery and self-persuasion, allowing them to make decisions based on their own motivations.

Listening and asking questions, rather than trying to convince or persuade, can be more effective in opening people's minds to change. Motivational interviewing involves distinguishing between sustain talk (maintaining the status quo) and change talk (expressing a desire, ability, need, or commitment to make adjustments). Change talk is considered a "golden thread" that should be encouraged and explored further to facilitate transformation.

Betty Bigombe's success in negotiating with warlord Joseph Kony demonstrates the power of empathetic listening without the pressure to persuade or fix the situation. Being a great listener involves showing genuine curiosity, asking truly interested questions, and facilitating the clear expression of another person's thoughts. Listening can encourage individuals to explore their opinions more deeply and share them more openly.

Moreover, group interactions and listening circles have been found to lead to more nuanced and less extreme attitudes. Effective listeners make their audiences feel respected and encourage them to approach their own views with more humility, doubt, and curiosity. Listening is a display of respect and care, offering others our undivided attention and demonstrating that their thoughts and goals are valued.

The means of achieving change are just as significant as the end result; using manipulative techniques can undermine the authenticity and effectiveness of motivational interviewing. By embracing the principles of motivational interviewing and cultivating a genuine and empathetic approach, we can promote positive behavior change and foster open-mindedness in individuals.

## Collective Rethinking
### Charged Conversations: Depolarizing Our Divided Discussions

At Columbia University, the Difficult Conversations Lab engages in a unique approach by pairing strangers with opposing views on controversial topics for 20-minute discussions. Their goal is to find common ground and create joint statements on shared views. The lab, led by psychologist Peter T. Coleman, challenges the assumption that mere exposure to opposing views will change people's minds.

One significant barrier to productive conversations is binary bias, where complex issues are simplified into two categories, leading to polarization and a reluctance to reconsider one's stance. To disrupt overconfidence cycles and encourage rethinking, issues should be presented with a range of perspectives and nuances.

The "both-sides" lens approach can be instrumental in increasing the likelihood of finding common ground and reaching consensus on contentious matters. One such complex and emotionally charged issue is climate change, which is influenced by political, economic, and emotional factors.

Communicating about climate change with complexity and nuance can help overcome binary bias and foster more productive discussions. Recognizing complexity as a signal of credibility and seeking sources that present multiple sides of an issue can promote a more nuanced understanding.

Expressing uncertainties and doubts can increase persuasiveness and lead to more meaningful conversations. Although complex discussions may not go viral, they are essential for gaining a deeper understanding of challenging issues like climate change.

Interestingly, conservatives showed greater receptiveness to climate science when presented with a green technology policy proposal rather than an emissions restriction proposal. This demonstrates the significance of offering shades of gray in discussions of solutions, shifting the focus from the problem to how to address it.

To promote mutual understanding and reduce polarization, perspective-seeking (engaging in conversations with others) is found to be more effective than perspective-taking (imagining others' viewpoints).

Infusing charged conversations with a wider range of emotions can lead to more productive and open discussions. Expressing complex emotions and acknowledging mixed feelings can foster rethinking and understanding in difficult conversations.

Emphasizing caveats and contingencies in scientific communication can improve credibility and increase openness to new information.

The dangers of idea cults, which oversimplify and rigidly defend certain concepts, are highlighted as they hinder progress and understanding in various fields.

In conclusion, complexifying discussions and embracing nuance are crucial for better communication and advancing solutions to complex issues. By exploring a broad spectrum of perspectives, we can foster more open-minded conversations and pave the way for productive solutions.

### Rewriting the Textbook: Teaching Students to Question Knowledge

Erin McCarthy, a history teacher, initially worked in museums before finding her passion in teaching. Her teaching approach revolves around encouraging her students to question and rethink historical information, leading to greater curiosity and understanding. To achieve this, Erin uses old history books to illustrate how knowledge evolves over time and has her students rewrite textbook chapters to incorporate underrepresented perspectives.

The movement in history education emphasizes the importance of questioning, critical examination, and fact-checking to foster intellectual humility and curiosity among students. Active learning methods are prioritized as they lead to deeper understanding and better knowledge retention compared to traditional lectures, which can hinder critical thinking and promote passive information reception. A meta-analysis has demonstrated that active learning is more effective, resulting in higher grades and lower failure rates.

While lectures still have a place in education, there is a growing need to reduce their dominance in favor of more interactive and engaging learning approaches that foster lifelong learners. This approach is in line with Robert Nozick's philosophy of continuously teaching new classes, reflecting the importance of continuous learning and rethinking.

Ron Berger, an education pioneer and teacher, emphasizes teaching students an ethic of excellence and the significance of constantly revising their thinking. His hands-on craftsmanship approach involves presenting students with complex problems to work through in phases, promoting independent thinking and exploration. Ron encourages his students to embrace confusion as a cue for curiosity and interest, fostering open-mindedness.

In Ron's classroom, students learn to think like young scientists, identifying problems, developing hypotheses, and designing their own experiments. Regular critique sessions help students revise their work based on input from others, creating a challenge network. Discussions on what excellence looks like and updating criteria with each new project further contribute to a culture of questioning and rethinking, leading to continuous improvement and growth.

An illustrative example of this approach is seen in Austin, a first-grade student, who significantly improved his butterfly drawing through multiple drafts, highlighting the power of revision and perseverance in the learning process.

Overall, the joy of discovery and the ability to rethink are essential aspects of education that enable individuals to become lifelong learners. By encouraging questioning, critical thinking, and active learning, educators like Erin McCarthy and Ron Berger foster a passion for learning that extends beyond the classroom.

### That’s Not the Way We’ve Always Done It: Building Cultures of Learning at Work

Luca Parmitano, the youngest astronaut to visit the International Space Station, faced a life-threatening situation during his second spacewalk when water started accumulating in his helmet. This incident highlights the critical importance of psychological safety in preventing mistakes and fostering learning cultures. Psychological safety is the environment where individuals can voice concerns and suggestions without fear of punishment. It does not mean relaxing standards or being overly agreeable, but rather creating a climate of respect, trust, and openness that allows people to raise concerns and question existing practices.

NASA's failure to foster a culture of rethinking has resulted in disasters like the Challenger explosion and the Columbia disintegration. To promote a learning culture, where growth is valued, questioning and doubting existing practices are encouraged, and curiosity about new routines is nurtured. Psychological safety is more likely to exist in teams that admit their mistakes freely and learn from them instead of hiding them to avoid penalties.

Ellen Ochoa, deputy director of flight crew operations at NASA, played a significant role in encouraging questioning assumptions to promote psychological safety. In the process of rethinking, asking questions like "How do you know?" helps challenge assumptions and fosters learning and improvement.

Creating psychological safety within an organization requires modeling openness and inclusiveness and building a coalition of colleagues committed to the change. Teams that share past experiences with receiving feedback and future development goals experience sustainable gains in psychological safety.

This sense of psychological safety is crucial for promoting innovation and preventing overconfidence cycles in performance cultures. Building it involves managers admitting their imperfections and remaining open to feedback. Managers who share their experiences with constructive criticism normalize vulnerability, making it easier for their teams to open up about their own struggles.

In a learning culture, psychological safety combined with accountability creates a zone where people feel free to experiment and challenge each other's ideas. In contrast, performance cultures often freeze best practices in time, hindering continuous improvement and learning.

Process accountability, which evaluates decision-making procedures, complements outcome accountability in promoting learning cultures. Companies like Amazon use the "disagree and commit" principle to encourage experimentation and rethinking.

Rethinking should occur in both inconsequential and consequential decisions to avoid overconfidence and incentivize progress. Separating decision makers from evaluators can promote rethinking and prevent biases in evaluating decisions.

NASA's transition to a learning culture involved encouraging employees to speak up and promoting humility, doubt, and curiosity in decision-making. Ellen Ochoa's decision to vote to delay a space shuttle launch due to sensor malfunctions exemplified the shift towards a learning culture at NASA.

In organizations with learning cultures, people live with fewer regrets and are more open to rethinking decisions and practices, fostering an environment of growth and continuous improvement.

## Conclusion
### Escaping Tunnel Vision: Reconsidering Our Best-Laid Career and Life Plans

As a kid, the author dreaded the question of what he wanted to be when he grew up, as adults seemed dissatisfied with his answers. Throughout his life, he tried different career aspirations, from superhero to NBA player to diving coach, but faced challenges and criticism each time. In contrast, his cousin Ryan had a clear career plan to become a doctor, fulfilling a family dream. Ryan's pursuit of becoming a neurosurgeon was relentless, and he ignored doubts and interests in other fields. Driven by grit, he completed a seven-year neurosurgery residency despite burnout and doubts, exemplifying escalation of commitment.

However, the author points out that identity foreclosure, settling on a career path prematurely, can prevent rethinking and personal growth. Many people may foreclose on life plans, such as career choices, leading to regrets and a lack of adaptation. To avoid this, the author suggests that students and individuals schedule career checkups to periodically activate rethinking cycles, maintain humility, and explore new possibilities. The case of Marissa Shandell illustrates the value of career checkups and rethinking when making a career change.

Management professor Herminia Ibarra's framework suggests thinking like scientists when considering career choices and transitions. This framework involves entertaining possible selves, developing hypotheses about career paths, and running experiments to test different identities. Regular career checkups are essential for maintaining openness to rethinking and exploring new possibilities.

The pursuit of happiness alone may lead to misery, as people may focus too much on evaluating life rather than experiencing it fully. Instead, happiness depends more on the frequency of positive emotions and actions rather than their intensity. The pursuit of meaning and contribution is more likely to lead to lasting happiness than solely focusing on pleasure. Passion is often developed through effort and skill-building rather than being discovered, and as people get older, they tend to focus more on finding meaning in actions that benefit others.

Happiness is a by-product of mastery and meaning, rather than a goal in itself. The author emphasizes the importance of viewing open systems, such as careers, relationships, and communities, that offer multiple paths and destinations, rather than fixating on a particular route. Smaller adjustments and job crafting can breathe new meaning into our lives without requiring major changes. Candice Walker's story exemplifies how individuals can redefine their roles through job crafting and find fulfillment in their work.
