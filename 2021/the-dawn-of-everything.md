## Farewell to Humanity's Childhood

Have you ever wondered about the true story of human history? Well, there's a lot we still don't know. One of the big questions people debate is whether humans are inherently good or evil. But here's the thing: the answer might not be so black and white. 

Many people believe that early humans lived in small, equal communities where everyone was treated fairly. But recent discoveries have shown that things were more complicated than that. Pre-agricultural societies experimented with different ways of governing themselves, and it was sometimes more fair and equal than we might have thought. 

There are different theories about why inequality exists in our world today. Some say it's because of the rise of agriculture and civilisation, while others believe it's just human nature to be selfish. These ideas shape our understanding of progress and how to create a better society. But sometimes, focusing too much on "inequality" can distract us from finding real solutions. It can make us feel like true equality is impossible to achieve. 

To understand human history, we must challenge how we think about it. We should have open and honest discussions and avoid oversimplifying complex ideas. History may have patterns, but we make the rules that govern it. We need to question assumptions about equality throughout history and listen to different perspectives. Indigenous thinkers, for example, have influenced how we see the world and offer valuable insights that challenge our understanding of history. By embracing diverse viewpoints, we can expand our understanding of what humans are capable of and imagine new possibilities for the future.

## Wicked Liberty

The story of social inequality has been passed down through generations, but there's more to it than meets the eye. It's not just about one person's ideas or a single moment. The question of inequality emerged during the Enlightenment, a period of new ideas and exploration. As Europeans encountered different cultures, including indigenous Americans, they started questioning their society and its flaws.

During conversations between Europeans and indigenous Americans, some eye-opening perspectives were shared. Indigenous thinkers pointed out the problems they saw in European society, like constant fighting and lack of generosity. They saw themselves as having a more prosperous and comfortable way of life, valuing different social arrangements. These perspectives influenced European thinkers who challenged the status quo.

One important concept that emerged from these discussions was "equality." Europeans learned about the indigenous ideals of individual liberty and began questioning their society's structures. Writers like Louis-Armand de Lom d'Arce and Madame de Graffigny were inspired by indigenous critiques and presented European society through the eyes of imagined outsiders. These ideas contributed to the famous essay by Rousseau on the origins of social inequality.

This book challenges stereotypes and aims to undo the damage caused by misconceptions about indigenous peoples. It explores the meaning of "equality" and examines how societies became hierarchical over time. By considering indigenous critiques and reevaluating our understanding of civilisation, the authors provide fresh perspectives on the origins of social inequality. It's an essential conversation for today's world and our issues.

## Unfreezing the Ice Age

Many societies have stories about a time when the world was different and new things came into existence. These stories serve a similar purpose as myths, reflecting our fears, desires, and concerns. In the 19th century, archaeologists began studying prehistory before written records and made discoveries that challenged what we thought we knew about human history. However, studying prehistory is tricky because there is limited evidence, and it's easy to fill in the gaps with speculative narratives.

Recent research has shown that early humans were physically diverse, and the idea of a single "mitochondrial Eve" as a common ancestor has been revised. We are more similar than we think, and our ancestors coexisted with other species, making it difficult to understand their social organisation. The plants and animals of the past were very different from what we see today, so it's hard to make assumptions based on the archaeological record.

It's important to remember that no one original form of human society exists. The search for it is more like making up stories than finding the truth. These stories can help us reflect on our species, but they are only partial insights and should be viewed cautiously. The concepts of the Garden of Eden and a single Eve are myths. The uniformity we see in humans today was established around half a million years ago, and there is no clear point when Homo sapiens "emerged."

Around 100,000 years ago, we had the first direct evidence of complex symbolic human behaviour or culture in Africa. The idea of a sudden revolution around 45,000 years ago is likely an illusion based on biased evidence from Europe. Recent research shows evidence of early complex behaviour in other parts of the world. The assumption that there was a gap between our biological origins and the appearance of human behaviour is no longer taken seriously. The European cultural explosion may be explained by climate, population changes, and increased human interactions.

Evolutionary anthropologists argue that human societies are political and can reject dominant behaviour. This suggests that throughout history, societies have explored different social structures. Recent archaeological findings challenge assumptions about prehistoric hunter-gatherers, revealing complex burial practices, trade networks, and impressive architecture. The evidence shows that strict egalitarianism may not have been the norm among hunter-gatherer groups and needs to be reevaluated.

Stone temples, elaborate burials, and bustling trade centres suggest Ice Age societies were more complex than previously thought. However, evidence of institutional inequality is patchy, and assumptions of universal hierarchy and centralised power may not be accurate. It's essential to discard lingering assumptions of indigenous peoples' incapability and recognise their scepticism, imagination, critical analysis, and thoughtfulness.

Indigenous societies value eccentricity and allow for non-conformity without punishment or coercion. Eccentric individuals can become leaders or reserves of talent and insight in times of crisis. Seasonal variations in social structures among indigenous societies reveal different social possibilities and the capacity for change.

Instead of searching for the origins of social inequality, it's more interesting to explore how we became stuck in one mode of social organisation and lost our political self-awareness. Understanding why permanent systems of inequality took hold after millennia of constructing and dismantling hierarchical forms is a puzzle. Exploring the impact of agriculture, permanent settlements, and land enclosure may provide insights into the origins of inequality, but there is still much to discover.

By asking questions that acknowledge our capacity as moral and social beings, we can better understand the human condition and the dynamics of inequality. The earliest evidence of human social life shows a variety of political forms rather than a linear progression. The challenge lies in understanding why permanent systems of inequality emerged and how we can navigate between different alternatives.

## Free People, the Origin of Cultures, and the Advent of Private Property

This chapter explores fascinating aspects of ancient societies and how social structures evolved. It touches upon the disappearance of traditional practices, the innovative social experiments of early humans, and the importance of festive calendars in agricultural civilisations. The ethnographic record provides insights into different social systems and is highlighted as a valuable resource.

Before the advent of farming, societies had unique cultural arrangements. The chapter discusses the presence of separate societies during the Upper Paleolithic period and the cosmopolitan nature of modern hunter-gatherer societies. It also examines the emergence of distinct cultures in the Mesolithic period and explores the concept of egalitarianism. The impact of surplus resources on property arrangements, elites' rise, and states' development are also examined.

A key focus of the chapter is the significance of autonomy and individual freedom in egalitarian societies. It introduces the concept of "free societies" that highly value individual autonomy. The passage also delves into the influence of wealth and social rank on marriage practices and women's freedom.

The chapter delves into humanity's historical quest for freedom and autonomy, contrasting it with the trend towards settled populations and increased subordination. It challenges traditional notions by exploring the lifestyles of foraging societies and showcasing archaeological discoveries that reshape our understanding of pre-agricultural societies.

Indigenous property systems and land management by foragers are also explored. The chapter challenges conventional views on land-based migration and highlights the importance of resource-rich coastal and river regions.

Moreover, the passage examines the connection between private property and the sacred, shedding light on the unique European conceptions of rights and freedoms. It discusses indigenous concepts of ownership and sacred property, emphasising the responsibility of caring for such properties. The intertwining of private property and the sacred within ritual contexts is also emphasised.

Overall, this chapter provides fascinating insights into the complexity of ancient societies, the evolution of social structures, and the interplay between concepts like autonomy, property, and the sacred throughout human history. It encourages readers to question traditional narratives and explore diverse perspectives on these critical topics.

## Many Seasons Ago

In this chapter, we dive into the fascinating world of ancient societies, focusing on indigenous Californians and Northwest Coast peoples. We explore their unique cultures, social structures, and attitudes towards slavery, challenging traditional beliefs.

Contrary to popular assumptions, pre-agricultural societies were not primitive or lacked sophistication. Indigenous Californians, for instance, led sedentary lifestyles, engaged in various industries, and accumulated wealth without relying on farming. This challenges the notion that agriculture was a critical factor in societal advancement. We also delve into the role of language in shaping cultural differences and ask thought-provoking questions about how cultural boundaries are formed.

We examine the culture areas approach, which categorises societies based on geographic regions. By critiquing this approach, we challenge the labels assigned to California and the Northwest Coast as "affluent foragers" or "complex hunter-gatherers." We specifically explore the Yurok people of California and their emphasis on money and private property, drawing connections to Max Weber's ideas about the Protestant work ethic and capitalism.

Comparing the two cultural areas, we uncover differences in social structures, such as the presence of warrior aristocracies and chattel slavery on the Northwest Coast. We delve into the nature of slavery in capturing societies where other populations were exploited for labour and vitality. We also examine the ethical dimensions of rejecting slavery through indigenous narratives and attitudes.

Through the lens of optimal foraging theory, we explore why indigenous Californians preferred acorns over fish and why significant slavery-related raiding was absent on the Northwest Coast. We investigate the rejection of slavery in the "shatter zone" of California and its implications for values and social organisation compared to the Northwest Coast. We also delve into the role of rituals, ceremonies, and money's influence in shaping these societies.

The chapter concludes by emphasising the complexity of the arguments between environmental determinism and cultural agency. We explore how hierarchy and equality are intertwined in social dynamics, noting that domination often starts within domestic institutions and intimate social relations. However, we also discover that egalitarian politics can emerge to prevent the extension of domination.

By examining these captivating aspects of ancient societies, we challenge conventional wisdom and invite readers to think critically about human history's diverse and complex nature.


## Gardens of Adonis

In this chapter, we embark on a journey to uncover the origins of agriculture and challenge the traditional stories we've been told. We explore fascinating aspects like the gardens of Adonis, fertility rites, and the worship of Adonis, delving into the debate between the gardens of Adonis and the more severe farming practices of the Thesmophoria.

Our exploration takes us to the archaeological site of Ã‡atalhÃ¶yÃ¼k in Turkey, where we examine their agricultural practices and recent discoveries that have overturned previous interpretations. We also delve into the interpretation of female figurines found in Neolithic contexts, questioning assumptions of matriarchy and highlighting the complexity and uncertainties surrounding gender roles and power dynamics in ancient societies.

We dive into the work of Matilda Joslyn Gage, Otto Gross, and Marija Gimbutas, exploring their ideas about Neolithic societies and the criticism they faced. We explore the intricate relationship between humans and plants during the Neolithic period, shedding light on the crucial role of women in activities like harvesting wild plants and experimenting with their properties. We challenge the notion that "wheat domesticated humans" and instead emphasise the contributions of women in scientific innovation and knowledge.

Examining the differences between upland and lowland populations in the Fertile Crescent, we focus on GÃ¶bekli Tepe and the unique cultural orientations of these regions. We explore the intriguing House of Skulls at Ã‡ayÃ¶nÃ¼ Tepesi and the contrasting cultural practices between upland and lowland populations.

As we conclude the chapter, we dare to challenge the prevailing narrative of an Agricultural Revolution. We question the idea that the shift to farming immediately led to inequality and the origins of social rank. We ponder what might have gone wrong if the adoption of farming was expected to steer us away from violence and domination.

Through this exploration, we encourage young adult readers to think critically about ancient societies' complexities and consider alternative perspectives that challenge conventional wisdom. We open ourselves to a richer understanding of our history by embracing uncertainty and questioning long-held beliefs.

## The Ecology of Freedom

In this chapter, we embark on a fascinating journey to uncover the origins and spread of farming in different parts of the world. We challenge simple explanations and delve into the complexities of this transition. 

We begin in the Fertile Crescent, where evidence suggests that early farming societies engaged in trade and specialised crafts without necessarily experiencing significant warfare or social inequality. We explore alternative forms of land tenure and communal management of plots, highlighting examples from various regions across the globe. 

The role of geography, climate, and ecology is examined as we delve into the favourable conditions of the Holocene epoch, which played a crucial role in the emergence of agriculture. We discuss concepts like the "Columbian exchange" and "ecological imperialism," exploring the impact of European expansion and the dominance of European economies on a global scale.

Through diverse case studies, including central Europe, Egypt, Sudan, Polynesia, and Amazonia, we illustrate the diverse forms of Neolithic farming and the interactions between farming and foraging populations. We highlight the boom-and-bust pattern observed in central Europe, the unique African variant of the Neolithic, the spread of the Lapita horizon to Polynesia, and the distinctive form of farming in Amazonia.

We emphasise early farming societies' complexities and challenges, such as periodic raiding, labour shortages, soil exhaustion, disease, and harvest failures. We caution against simplistic reasoning and advocate for a nuanced understanding of the dynamics and complexities of human societies in different regions and periods.

Overall, this chapter provides valuable insights into the origins and spread of farming, challenging prevailing narratives and showcasing the diversity and intricacies of early agricultural societies. It lays the foundation for further exploration of the fascinating developments that have shaped human societies over the past 5,000 years.

## Imaginary Cities

In this eye-opening chapter, we dive into the origins and nature of cities, challenging commonly held beliefs and exploring the fascinating world of early urban societies in different parts of the globe.

We begin by questioning the notion that physical structures solely define cities. Instead, we argue that the inhabitants' thoughts, behaviours, and actions shape cities. By examining archaeological evidence, we challenge the assumption that the transition to cities always led to the rise of states or centralised power.

We journey through early cities in Eurasia, Mesoamerica, and other regions, uncovering their incredible diversity and experimentation in urban form. We highlight that many early cities lacked authoritarian rule and exhibited a range of ecological practices. Contrary to popular belief, their impact on the environment and social relationships varied greatly depending on the location.

Through captivating case studies, such as the Ukrainian mega-sites, Mesopotamian cities, the Harappan civilisation in the Indus Valley, and Neolithic cities in China, we dismantle conventional assumptions about urbanisation, social hierarchy, and governance. These examples reveal participatory government, communal decision-making, and social experimentation within early cities.

We acknowledge the limitations of our knowledge due to the need for written records from these early periods. This highlights the importance of ongoing research and exploration to deepen our understanding of social relationships, kinship, and governance in ancient cities.

Overall, this chapter challenges prevailing narratives and invites us to reconsider the rise of cities from a fresh perspective. We emphasise early urban societies' complexities and diverse paths, showcasing the power of social imagination and experimentation in shaping human communities. Prepare to be inspired by the potential for political revolutions within urban settings!

## Hiding in Plain Sight

In this captivating chapter, we delve into the cities of Teotihuacan and Tlaxcala in Mesoamerica, challenging prevailing views and unveiling the fascinating political structures in these urban societies.

Teotihuacan, renowned for its grandeur and sophistication, surprises us by lacking evidence of kings or ruling elites. Instead, its art and imagery celebrate the collective community, suggesting a society consciously striving for equality. Teotihuacan's influence extended beyond its borders, with evidence of interaction and trade with other Mesoamerican city-states. The presence of Teotihuacan individuals in Maya city-states hints at their influence and potential roles as "stranger-kings."

Adjacent to the Aztec Empire, Tlaxcala had a unique political system resembling a republic. Its famous urban council made decisions through reasoned arguments, lengthy discussions, and seeking consensus. This challenges the dominant narrative of European conquest and reveals the intricate political deliberation and complex decision-making processes within indigenous societies.

We emphasise the importance of recognising and appreciating the indigenous political systems and practices rather than attributing them to mere mimicry or European influences. To gain insight, we turn to firsthand accounts such as Francisco Cervantes de Salazar's CrÃ³nica de la Nueva EspaÃ±a, which describes indigenous figures and institutions.

The Tlaxcalan Actas, written records of municipal council proceedings, affirm indigenous politicians' rhetorical skills, consensus decision-making, and reasoned debates. Archaeological evidence supports the existence of a cityscape dominated by well-appointed residences and district plazas, indicating the functioning of urban democracy in Tlaxcala.

Overall, this chapter shatters simplistic narratives and reveals the complexity and diversity of political structures in Mesoamerican cities. It sets the stage for the next chapter, where we explore the concept of the state and its relevance to political developments in Mesoamerica. Get ready for a journey into the intricate world of ancient politics!

## Why the State Has No Origin

In this thought-provoking chapter, we embark on a journey to explore the origins of the state and challenge traditional ideas about how states came into being. We examine ancient civilisations and political structures, unveiling the complexities of power dynamics and domination.

The chapter begins by questioning the very definition of the state, emphasising its limitations and urging us to delve deeper into the questions surrounding human history and the nature of power. We delve into the intricate relationship between property, power, and the state, highlighting how coercion, control of information, and individual charisma play crucial roles in political power and authority.

Case studies of civilisations such as the Aztecs, Incas, Mayans, Olmecs, ChavÃ­n, Natchez, and Shilluk showcase unique forms of governance and domination. These examples challenge conventional definitions of states and shed light on power dynamics' intricate and varied nature.

The chapter also delves into the role of ritual killing, bureaucracy, and administration in state formation, examining how central authority affects caring labour and societal relationships. Concepts such as sovereignty, bureaucracy, and charismatic politics are explored in the context of state structures.

Furthermore, the chapter emphasises the significance of freedom, mutual aid, and the role of women in developing civilisations. It challenges the traditional narrative that portrays civilisation as inherently hierarchical and authoritarian, instead emphasising the importance of voluntary cooperation and social activism.

Throughout the chapter, the author emphasises the need for a nuanced understanding of ancient political structures and acknowledges the limitations of existing archaeological evidence. The chapter concludes by suggesting that ongoing research and advancements in archaeological techniques may uncover more "lost civilisations" and encourage us to reevaluate our understanding of social possibilities and the formation of states. Get ready to question the conventional and explore the complexities of ancient political systems!

## Full Circle

In this eye-opening chapter, we are invited to challenge the conventional understanding of human history and explore alternative paths that have been overlooked. The book argues that our understanding of history has been shaped by an evolutionary framework and a European backlash against indigenous critiques, leading to a narrow view of the past. It urges us to question the certainty of our present global arrangements and reconsider the vast range of social possibilities.

The chapter takes us on a journey to explore the indigenous societies of North America, unveiling their rich and complex social structures and intellectual traditions. We encounter societies such as the Wendat and Haudenosaunee that defy the assumptions of social evolution. These societies moved away from agriculture and followed unique paths challenging expected evolutionary patterns. We delve into the fascinating examples of Cahokia and Hopewell, marvelling at their ritual practices, engineering skills, and artistic brilliance. Through these examples, we understand that North American indigenous societies had their own vibrant intellectual and political history, shaping their conceptions of freedom and equality.

Furthermore, the chapter delves into the reformations and transformations in Native North America as a response to European colonisation. We learn about the democratisation of theocratic elites into communal councils and the shifts in access to sacred power. The Osage and the Iroquoian-speaking peoples, such as the Wendat and Haudenosaunee, are captivating examples of complex political institutions. They developed tiered systems of initiation, federal structures, and consensus-building processes. These indigenous societies valued individual autonomy and held conflicting ideologies, which profoundly influenced the indigenous critique of European society and left a lasting impact on Enlightenment thinkers.

The chapter encourages us to question traditional narratives and embrace a deeper understanding of human history. It underscores the importance of indigenous perspectives, inviting us to recognise the diverse possibilities and complexities of the past. By challenging the teleological understanding of social evolution, we open ourselves to a world of exploration and new insights into the human experience.
