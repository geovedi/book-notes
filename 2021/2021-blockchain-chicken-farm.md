# Blockchain Chicken Farm
**Author**: Xiaowei Wang | **Year**: 2021

## Summary
"Blockchain Chicken Farm" explores how technology is reshaping rural China and challenging our assumptions about progress, innovation, and the relationship between urban and rural life. Wang takes readers from Chinese chicken farms with blockchain-tracking ankle bracelets to American Facebook livestreams selling pearls, revealing how AI, surveillance technology, and digital platforms are transforming food production, labor, and human connection.

The book challenges "metronormativity"—the belief that urban life is superior to rural—and argues for a more inclusive vision of technological progress that serves all communities, not just city dwellers. Through vivid reporting and sharp analysis, Wang shows how technology promises efficiency while often deepening existing inequalities, and how people in both rural China and struggling American towns find innovative ways to navigate these changes.

**Readers interested in technology ethics, food systems, global economics, or China's social transformation will gain a fresh perspective on how technology shapes daily life and what alternatives are possible.**

## Core Insights

### Technology Reinforces Power Structures
Wang argues that technology isn't neutral—it reflects and amplifies existing economic and social hierarchies. The "Blockchain Chicken Farm" exemplifies this: chickens wear $5 blockchain ankle bracelets while farmers like Jiang make only $14 per $40 chicken. The technology creates premium products for urban consumers while extracting value from rural producers.

> "Each chicken wears an ankle bracelet that is physically tamperproof, which tracks characteristics such as number of steps taken and the location of the chicken. A chicken Fitbit of sorts."

**Quick Take**: Before adopting new technology, ask who really benefits from the efficiency gains.

### Scale Creates Problems It Claims to Solve
The book reveals how industrial agriculture generates diseases and food safety concerns that companies then sell technology solutions for. NetEase's AI pig farming promises efficiency but requires millions of pigs to be cost-effective, pushing further industrialization that created the problems in the first place.

> "AI is not the balm to any problem—it is just one piece of the ever-hungry quest for scale."

**Quick Take**: Be skeptical of technological fixes to problems created by scaling.

### Economic Precarity Connects China and America
Wang draws surprising parallels between Chinese rural livestreamers selling local products and American women running multilevel marketing "pearl parties" on Facebook. Both represent responses to economic insecurity and declining traditional opportunities, using digital platforms to create alternative income streams.

> "At a pearl party, the hostess announces your name to the livestream audience... As a viewer, you pay for emotional labor."

**Quick Take**: Global economic transformation creates similar opportunities and challenges in seemingly different cultures.

### Rural Innovation Matters More Than Urban Tech
The book celebrates rural innovators like Sun Wei, who found opportunity operating agricultural drones, and challenges the assumption that meaningful innovation only happens in tech hubs. Rural communities aren't backward—they're dynamic spaces where traditional knowledge meets cutting-edge technology in unique ways.

**Quick Take**: Look for innovation beyond Silicon Valley and urban centers.

### Surveillance Has Many Faces
From blockchain-tracked chickens to AI-monitored pigs, Wang shows how surveillance technology is reshaping agriculture under the guise of food safety and efficiency. This reveals a broader pattern where monitoring and control are packaged as consumer protection while extracting data and value from producers.

**Quick Take**: Question who benefits when surveillance is sold as safety or quality control.

## Best Quotes
- "Questioning metronormativity means demanding something outside the strict binaries of rural versus urban, natural versus man-made, digital versus physical, and remote as disengaged versus metropolitan as connected."

- "With one of the worst, most error-prone health-care systems in the developed world, why wouldn't you seek out online health advice or alternative explanations for illness in the United States?"

- "Technology promises efficiency while often deepening existing inequalities, and people find innovative ways to navigate these changes."

## Key Takeaways
- **Question technological promises**: Look beyond efficiency claims to see who really benefits from new systems
- **Support rural innovation**: Seek out and value technological solutions developed outside traditional tech hubs
- **Understand global connections**: Recognize how economic transformation affects communities worldwide
- **Resist metronormativity**: Challenge the assumption that urban ways of living are superior to rural ones
- **Consider human costs**: Evaluate how technological solutions affect different people across supply chains
- **Value traditional knowledge**: Recognize the wisdom in traditional practices alongside technological advancement

## Questions to Consider
- How does your own metronormativity affect how you view progress and innovation?
- Who benefits when efficiency is prioritized over other values in food production?
- What technologies in your life extract value from you while promising convenience?
- How can we create technological systems that serve all communities, not just urban ones?
- What traditional knowledge have we lost in our rush toward technological solutions?

## Conclusion
"Blockchain Chicken Farm" is worth your time because it challenges fundamental assumptions about progress, technology, and whose futures matter. Wang's reporting from rural China and American towns reveals how technological transformation affects real people's lives in ways that aren't visible from urban tech hubs.

The book's biggest strength is its ability to connect seemingly disparate stories—blockchain chickens, AI pigs, drone operators, and Facebook pearl parties—into a coherent critique of how technology often reinforces existing inequalities while promising efficiency and progress. Wang's personal journey of questioning their own metronormativity adds depth and makes the book feel more like a conversation than a lecture.

Read this book if you want to understand how technology shapes food systems, why rural innovation matters, or how global economic transformation affects communities differently. Most importantly, read it to question your own assumptions about what progress looks like and who gets to define it.
