## Core Insights

### Think Lucky, Be Lucky: The Power of Positive Mental Attitude
A positive mental attitude is the foundation of successful street photography. When you go out expecting to see interesting pictures, you become more positive and consequently luckier. This isn't about magical thinking—it's about being primed to notice opportunities that others miss. As John Szarkowski said, "Luck is the attentive photographer's best teacher." Your mindset literally affects what you see and how you respond to it.

> "A positive mental attitude is the key to great photographs. If you go out expecting to see interesting pictures, you tend to be more positive, and then luckier."

**Quick Take**: Develop the mantra "I will be lucky" before heading out to shoot. Remember that street photography is 99.9% failure, but positive persistence pays off.

### The Three Fs: Fish, Follow, F**k!
The most productive street photography strategies fall into three categories: "Fish" (find a promising location and wait), "Follow" (track developing situations), or "F**k!" (react instantly to unexpected opportunities). The fishing approach is particularly effective—find a location with good background, people, and light, then let moments come to you. When following, don't settle for one shot—keep shooting through the moment.

> "The key to getting good pictures is threefold: find a location that looks promising, track something with potential, or jump straight in!"

**Quick Take**: Spend time scouting locations that combine interesting backgrounds with good foot traffic. Sometimes the best approach is to plant yourself and let the world come to you.

### Be Calm: Think Fast, Move Slow
The most successful street photographers learn to blend into crowds and remain calm while their minds are racing. Physical slowness with mental alertness creates a paradoxical state that allows you to capture authentic moments without drawing attention to yourself. Practice subtle body language—bend your knees, keep elbows in, wear muted colors. This approach enables you to get incredibly close to subjects without disrupting natural moments.

> "Street photography is not about rules… Don't let people tell you what to do. Do what feels right for you and your voice will come through."

**Quick Take**: Adopt a humble stance and move deliberately through crowds. The calmer you appear externally, the more freedom you have to observe and capture genuine moments.

### See With a Child's Eyes: Maintain Fresh Vision
Children notice everything because they're experiencing the world for the first time. Recreate this fresh perspective by focusing on whatever catches your attention—bright colors, strange combinations, mini narratives, funny juxtapositions. Get low to the ground, look up at unusual angles, and notice the details that most adults filter out. This childlike way of seeing reveals photographic opportunities hidden in plain sight.

> "If you can learn to see… as a child sees… you'll be on the road to developing a way of seeing that is essential to street photography."

**Quick Take**: Practice photographing from unexpected angles. Try shooting from waist level or even ground level to discover perspectives that make ordinary scenes extraordinary.

### Shoot First, Think Later: Overcome Hesitation
The greatest street photography opportunities are lost to hesitation. When you see something potentially interesting, shoot first and decide later whether to show or use the image. This philosophy isn't about being careless—it's about not letting self-doubt prevent you from capturing potentially great moments. Most fears about negative reactions are exaggerated; most people don't notice or don't mind being photographed in public spaces.

> "When you're out and you see something you think is worth photographing, shoot first and think later about whether you're going to show the picture."

**Quick Take**: Practice the "one-second rule"—if you see something interesting, you have one second to decide and shoot before the moment is gone.
