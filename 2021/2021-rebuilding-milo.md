# Rebuilding Milo
**Authors**: Dr. Aaron Horschig, Dr. Kevin Sonthana | **Year**: 2021

## Summary
"Rebuilding Milo" is a revolutionary guide that challenges conventional wisdom about injury treatment and performance training for strength athletes. Written by a performance physical therapist, the book reframes pain not as a medical problem to be medicated, but as a movement issue requiring active rehabilitation. Through the story of Milo of Croton—the ancient Greek who built legendary strength by progressively lifting a growing calf—the authors introduce the principle of progressive overload while exposing why the "lift, lift, break" cycle plagues modern athletes.

The book provides a systematic approach to injury rehabilitation across six major pain areas (back, hip, knee, shoulder, elbow, and ankle), with each chapter following the same structure: anatomy, screening tests, classification, and rebuilding process. Most controversially, it demolishes the long-held belief in icing as a primary treatment method, presenting compelling evidence that inflammation is actually essential for healing and that ice delays recovery by blocking crucial inflammatory processes.

This guide is ideal for strength athletes, CrossFitters, powerlifters, weightlifters, and anyone experiencing training-related aches and pains who wants to understand the root causes rather than just masking symptoms with temporary fixes.

## Core Insights

### Pain is a Movement Problem, Not a Medical Problem
The book's central thesis challenges the medicalization of pain. Rather than viewing pain as something to be eliminated with pills or ice, Horschig argues that most training-related pain stems from dysfunctional movement patterns, poor stability, and insufficient recovery. Pain serves as your body's protective mechanism—it changes how you move, limits mobility, and diminishes strength to prevent further injury.

> "Today's society tells us that pain is a medical problem. I don't believe this is correct. You see, the way in which many in the medical community address pain is to treat the symptoms of pain and not the cause."

**Quick Take**: Stop asking "what can I take for this pain?" and start asking "what movement caused this pain, and how can I fix it?"

### The Three-Step Rebuilding Process
Each injury follows the same systematic rehabilitation approach: (1) Wind down pain sensitivity by avoiding movements that trigger pain, (2) Improve core stability and mobility in joints above and below the injury site, and (3) Improve movement quality by relearning proper patterns and reactivating inhibited muscles. This process addresses the root cause rather than just symptoms.

> "There is always a reason for pain. It doesn't develop out of thin air."

**Quick Take**: Your rehabilitation should follow a clear progression from pain-free movement to loaded movement, not the reverse.

### Core Stability Trumps Core Strength
Many athletes with back pain already have strong backs—they lack core stability and endurance. The book introduces Dr. Stuart McGill's "Big Three" exercises (curl-up, side plank, bird-dog) that create spinal stiffness without the harmful spinal loading of traditional core exercises like crunches and back extensions.

> "The definition of stability is the ability to limit excessive or unwanted motion."

**Quick Take**: Replace dynamic core exercises with isometric holds that teach all core muscles to work together as a coordinated system.

### Don't Ice—Move It Off!
Perhaps the book's most controversial insight is that inflammation is essential for healing, and ice actually delays recovery by preventing white blood cells from reaching injured tissue. Studies show that icing leads to 65% smaller regenerated muscle cells and more scarring compared to no icing.

> "Healing requires inflammation. It isn't a bad thing at all; it is an essential biological response to injury."

**Quick Take**: After injury, focus on pain-free movement and muscle contraction to evacuate swelling through the lymphatic system rather than trying to prevent inflammation.

### The Car Tire Philosophy
The book uses a powerful analogy: using temporary fixes like painkillers or ice is like putting tape over a hole in your car's tire—it might get you to the mechanic, but it doesn't fix the underlying problem. Similarly, you should be able to perform basic maintenance on your own body rather than relying on medical intervention for every ache and pain.

> "You wouldn't bring your car to the mechanic to put air in your tires or call an electrician to change a light bulb."

**Quick Take**: Develop the knowledge and skills to handle your own minor injuries and movement issues before seeking professional help.

## Best Quotes
- "The purpose of life is to discover your gift. The work of life is to develop it. The meaning in life is to give your gift away."
- "Using temporary quick fixes to address pain is like putting a piece of tape over a hole in your car's tire."
- "Healing requires inflammation. It isn't a bad thing at all; it is an essential biological response to injury."
- "You wouldn't bring your car to the mechanic to put air in your tires or call an electrician to change a light bulb."
- "There is always a reason for pain. It doesn't develop out of thin air."

## Action Items
- **Screen your pain**: Use the book's diagnostic tests to identify what movements trigger your pain and which pain-free movements you can perform
- **Master the McGill Big Three**: Perform curl-ups, side planks, and bird-dog exercises daily to build core stability endurance
- **Address mobility limitations**: Improve hip and thoracic spine mobility before core stability work to prevent compensations
- **Reactivate inhibited muscles**: Focus on glute activation exercises if you have back pain, as these muscles often "fall asleep"
- **Embrace pain-free movement**: After injury, perform light exercises and isometric contractions to facilitate healing rather than resting completely
- **Ditch the ice**: Replace post-workout icing with active recovery methods like walking, light exercise, or foam rolling

## Questions to Consider
- What movements in your training consistently cause pain, and what pain-free alternatives can you substitute?
- Are you treating symptoms (pain) or addressing the root cause (dysfunctional movement)?
- How can you modify your training to include more stability work and fewer harmful spinal loading exercises?
- What preconceived notions about injury treatment (like icing) might be preventing optimal recovery?
- Are you building a body that can withstand progressive overload, or just repeatedly breaking yourself down?

## Conclusion
"Rebuilding Milo" is essential reading for any serious strength athlete who wants to train sustainably for decades rather than burning out through injury. The book's greatest strength is its systematic approach that demystifies pain and puts athletes back in control of their bodies.

While some recommendations (like abandoning ice) may seem radical, the evidence-based approach and practical exercise progressions make this an invaluable resource. The biggest reason to read this book is that it teaches you not just how to fix injuries, but how to understand your body's signals and prevent injuries before they occur.

However, be prepared to challenge long-held beliefs about recovery. If you're unwilling to question traditional approaches like the RICE protocol, you may resist the book's most powerful insights. But for athletes ready to take ownership of their physical health and training longevity, "Rebuilding Milo" provides the roadmap to become stronger, more resilient, and better equipped to handle the inevitable stresses of serious training.
