### Humble Human Influences
- Introduction
  - Weight balance analogy: Weight influenced by calories consumed and burned.
  - Earth's temperature balance analogy: Balance between sunlight warming and infrared cooling.
- Radiative Equilibrium and Albedo
  - Radiative equilibrium: Balance where planet gains/loses no energy, maintaining temperature.
  - Earth's albedo: Reflectivity affecting temperature; changes in reflection affect warming/cooling.
  - Earthshine observations: Measure global albedo through lunar observations.
  - Albedo's role in climate: Changes in albedo can offset warming influence of CO2.
- Greenhouse Effect and Insulation
  - Earth's temperature influenced by balance of absorbed sunlight and radiated heat.
  - Greenhouse gases: Intercept and impede heat flow from Earth's surface.
  - Water vapor's importance: Dominant greenhouse gas, intercepts significant heat.
  - Carbon dioxide (CO2): Its concentration increase from human activities affects heat interception.
  - CO2's potency: Few molecules of CO2 can have a large effect on heat interception.
  - Spectrum of heat radiation: Greenhouse gases affect different wavelengths differently.
  - Climate sensitivity: Small changes in heat interception correspond to significant temperature changes.
- Climate Influences and Human Factors

### Emissions Explained and Extrapolated
- Introduction and Personal Anecdote:
  - Koonin recalls an event at Buckingham Palace involving Prince Philip and climate discussion.
  - The topic of the evening was climate and energy, and Koonin engaged in a conversation about carbon dioxide emissions and global temperatures.
- The Significance of Greenhouse Gases:
  - Carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane (CH4) are significant human-caused greenhouse gases affecting the climate.
  - Efforts to reduce climate impact focus on reducing emissions due to the increasing concentrations of these gases.
  - The connection between concentrations and emissions is complex, particularly for CO2.
- Carbon Movement in Earth's Reservoirs:
  - Earth's carbon is distributed among various reservoirs: crust, oceans, land, and atmosphere.
  - Natural processes move carbon between these reservoirs, such as the annual cycle of plant growth and respiration.
  - Human-emitted CO2 is a small addition to the natural carbon cycle.
- The Keeling Curve and CO2 Concentrations:
  - The Keeling curve shows the monthly average concentration of CO2 at Mauna Loa, Hawaii.
  - CO2 concentration has risen steadily over decades, with seasonal fluctuations due to plant growth and respiration.
- Historical and Geological CO2 Concentrations:
  - Historical data and carbon isotope analysis confirm the recent rise in CO2 concentrations due to human activities.
  - Geological data show that today's CO2 levels are relatively low compared to the past.
- CO2's Long-lasting Influence:
  - CO2 persists in the atmosphere for a long time, which complicates efforts to reduce concentrations.
  - Modest emission reductions would slow the increase but not prevent it; CO2 concentrations would continue to rise for centuries.
- Methane's Influence and Sources:
  - Methane (CH4) is another significant greenhouse gas with a shorter atmospheric lifetime.
  - Methane's warming impact is more potent than CO2 on a per-molecule basis.
  - Methane emissions come from various sources, including livestock, agriculture, and landfills.
- Future Scenarios and Influence on Climate:
  - Future climate depends on human and natural influences, as well as internal variability.
  - IPCC's Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs) describe different emission scenarios.
  - Various RCPs project different degrees of population growth, economic activity, and emissions.
  - Human influences on the climate will continue to grow unless emissions are drastically reduced.
- Challenges:
  - It's challenging to disentangle human influences from other climate factors.
  - The relationship between emissions and atmospheric concentrations complicates climate moderation.
  - Climate models project higher temperatures with increased emissions, but impacts are complex and require detailed analysis.

### Many Muddled Models
- Climate Models and Uncertainties:
  - Climate models are complex computer simulations used to predict climate changes.
  - The models are based on physical laws and factors affecting the Earth's climate system.
  - However, they have limitations and uncertainties due to factors like subgrid representations, tuning, and internal variability.
  - The spread of results among different models has been increasing over time, challenging the idea that the science is settled.
- Challenges in Temperature Predictions:
  - The assessment reports often emphasize the rise in average temperature and focus on model-calculated changes.
  - There are difficulties in reproducing observed temperature variations, such as the warming from 1910 to 1940.
  - Slow changes in ocean currents and interactions contribute to cyclic behaviors (e.g., El NiÃ±o, AMO) that affect climate.
  - Models struggle to replicate the strength, duration, and timing of these cyclic variations, leading to uncertainties.
- Equilibrium Climate Sensitivity (ECS) and Uncertainty:
  - ECS is a measure of how much average surface temperature would increase with doubled CO2 concentration.
  - Climate models have provided varying estimates of ECS, contributing to uncertainty in predicting temperature changes.
  - Different models in CMIP6 ensemble show ECS values that exceed the upper limit previously estimated by the IPCC.
  - Higher sensitivities in some models arise from uncertainties in cloud-aerosol interactions.
- Comparing Temperature Rise and Forcings:
  - An alternative approach to estimating sensitivity involves comparing temperature rise with human and natural influences.
  - Internal variability, lag in temperature response, and uncertainties in forcings make this approach challenging.
  - A combined top-down and grid-based approach suggests a likely ECS range of 2.6 to 4.1Â°C, lower than AR5's estimate.
- Challenges in Climate Modeling:
  - Climate models are used to assess climate response strategies like albedo modification (geoengineering).
  - Uncertainties in modeling albedo modification highlight limitations in predicting consequences and risks.
  - Similar uncertainties exist in modeling future greenhouse gas emissions and their effects on the Earth system.

### Hyping the Heat
- Introduction: Weather Presenters and Climate Change Attribution
  - TV weather presenters have transitioned to climate and weather presenters, attributing severe weather events to a "broken climate."
  - Media, politicians, and some scientists implicate human influences as the cause of extreme weather events.
  - The media's portrayal of weather events and climate change often lacks scientific accuracy.
- Uncertainty in Detecting Extreme Weather Trends
  - Observations over a century show no significant change in most types of extreme weather events.
  - High levels of uncertainty exist in detecting trends in extreme weather due to various factors.
  - IPCC's AR5 WGI report indicates low confidence in trends like floods, droughts, and severe weather phenomena.
- Event Attribution Studies and Their Limitations
  - Event attribution studies connect extreme weather events to human-caused climate change.
  - These studies focus on disasters and use climate modeling to determine human influence.
  - Attribution studies are challenging due to multiple factors contributing to extreme events.
- Disconnect Between Popular Perception and Scientific Evidence
  - Public perception suggests increasing frequency and severity of extreme weather events.
  - Scientific evidence indicates no long-term trends attributed to human influences.
  - Attribution studies and media coverage contribute to this disconnect.
- Analysis of Record Temperatures
  - IPCC's AR5 highlights a "very likely" increase in warm days and nights since 1950.
  - Public perception of increasing extreme high temperatures contradicts data analysis.
  - The US shows record low temperatures becoming less common, but record daily high temperatures remain consistent.

  - CSSR's Figure ES.5 (ratio graph) misrepresents increasing high temperature records.
  - The ratio graph method used in the CSSR shows dramatic fluctuations, not accurate trends.
  - The absolute record method reveals a lack of significant trend in high temperature records.
- Academies' Review and Government Response
  - The National Academies' review panel criticized the CSSR's treatment of temperature extremes.
  - The expert panel's feedback was incorporated, but the misleading ratio graph remained.
  - The government response acknowledged changes but failed to address misleading data representation.
- Media's Role and Misleading Interpretations
  - The media widely disseminates inaccurate information about high temperature records.
  - Associated Press article emphasizes heat records falling more frequently than cold ones.
  - The media often overlooks the decline in both hot and cold temperature records.
  - There have been changes in temperature extremes across the US, with declining cold records.
  - The annual number of high temperature records shows no significant trend.
  - Media portrays warming extremes, while the data suggests milder temperatures in some aspects.

### Tempest Terrors
- Introduction
  - Media frequently highlights the worsening impact of hurricanes.
  - The message is that storms are becoming more frequent and intense due to rising greenhouse gas emissions.
  - However, the actual data and research conflict with this narrative.
  - Assessment reports often present summaries inconsistent with their own findings.
- Hurricanes
  - Hurricanes are tropical cyclones with a low-pressure center and intense thunderstorms.
  - They are categorized by intensity and can be measured using various indices.
  - There's an interplay of factors influencing hurricane activity.
  - The Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation (AMO) affects sea surface temperatures and can impact hurricane activity.
  - The increase in hurricane activity does not have a clear relationship with rising ocean temperatures.
  - The National Climate Assessment (NCA) reported trends in hurricane activity that contradict explicit findings in the research.
- Tornadoes
  - Tornadoes are localized, destructive storms with varying intensities.
  - There's no significant long-term trend in the number of tornadoes.
  - Weak tornadoes were underreported in earlier records, contributing to the apparent increase in recent years.
  - There's more variability in tornado occurrence patterns in recent decades.
  - Improved radar warnings have significantly reduced tornado-related deaths.
  - Predicting future tornado patterns is highly uncertain due to complex factors and modeling limitations.
  - Claims of worsening tornadoes due to climate change lack strong evidence.

### Precipitation Perilsâ€”from Floods to Fires

  - Weather variability and climate change are often intertwined in discussions about precipitation.
  - The perception of climate change can be influenced by individual weather events.
  - Climate and weather are distinct concepts; weather events can't definitively be attributed to climate change.
- Precipitation Patterns and Climate Change:
  - Rising temperatures can lead to more snow due to increased evaporation.
  - Annual snowfall trends in Washington, DC, show declining total snowfall over the long term.
  - The relationship between human-caused climate change and snowfall is complex.
- Global Precipitation Trends and Variability:
  - Precipitation trends vary widely across regions and over time.
  - Global precipitation anomalies show a slight increase over land since 1901, but with high variability.
  - Confidence in global precipitation trends before 1951 is low; afterward, some areas show increased precipitation.
- Drought and Flood Trends:
  - Drought and flood trends are difficult to assess due to complex interactions.
  - No global-scale trend in drought or dryness is confirmed.
  - Floods' frequency and magnitude vary regionally, with increases in some areas.
- Wildfires and Their Relationship to Climate:
  - Satellite data shows a decline in the global area burned by fires from 1998 to 2015.
  - Human activities like agriculture have contributed to the decline in fire-prone regions.
  - While climate change affects wildfires, other human factors like forest management and ignition play a crucial role.
  - The Western US has seen an increase in large forest fires since the early 1980s due to higher temperatures and drier conditions.
- Caution in Interpreting Model Predictions:
  - Climate models are limited in their ability to predict regional climate changes.
  - The reliability of model projections for precipitation changes is questioned.
  - Policy decisions based solely on model projections can be misleading.
- Case Study: Winter Precipitation in England and Wales:
  - The example of winter precipitation in England and Wales shows the unpredictability of climate models.
  - The record wet winter of 2014 was followed by several years of more typical rainfall.
  - Natural variability, such as the North Atlantic Oscillation, has a significant impact on extreme rainfalls.

### Sea Level Scares
- Sea Level Rise and Climate Change
  - The cover of the September 2013 National Geographic magazine depicted a partially submerged Statue of Liberty, highlighting rising sea levels due to climate change.
  - Tide gauge records at The Battery, Manhattan, showed sea level rising at about 30 cm per century since 1855.
  - Geological data spanning 400,000 years revealed cycles of sea level changes due to variations in Earth's orbit and axis tilt.
  - Sea level has risen by about 120 meters since the Last Glacial Maximum, with variations over time.
- Measuring Sea Level Rise
  - Sea level measurements are affected by factors like gravity variations, ocean currents, temperature, and air pressure.

  - Climate models offer projections under various emissions scenarios (RCP2.6 to RCP8.5), but these models have uncertainties, especially regarding ice sheet dynamics.
  - There's uncertainty in predicting regional and local sea level changes.
- Local vs. Global Sea Level Rise
  - Local sea level rise is influenced by regional factors like tectonics, subsidence, ocean currents, and land use.
  - Climate models offer projections for various cities, but these projections are even more uncertain than global sea level rise projections.
- Assessment Reports and Media Coverage
  - Assessment reports like the Climate Science Special Report (CSSR) and media coverage often focus on sea level rise itself, rather than the rate of rise, which can be misleading.
  - Media coverage sometimes lacks context and fails to highlight long-term trends.
- Understanding Sea Level Rise
  - Attribution of sea level rise to human-caused warming is complex due to natural variability and long-term cycles.
  - The risk associated with sea level rise requires clear and unbiased communication, as it involves various factors like currents, erosion, and land use.
- Adaptation
  - Addressing sea level rise necessitates understanding its causes and potential impacts.
  - Even if emissions were to cease immediately, sea level would continue to rise due to the lag in ice melting.
  - Preparing for potential sea level threats requires further research, adaptation, and resource allocation.

### Apocalypses That Ain't
- Climate-Related Deaths
  - The media often attribute various societal catastrophes to human-influenced climate change.
  - However, historical data doesn't necessarily support these claims.
  - Projections of future impacts often rely on extreme scenarios fed into models.
  - Examples of headline "apocalypses that aren't" include climate-related deaths.
  - Climate-related deaths are based on speculation, strained assumptions, and incorrect data use.
  - Weather-related death rates have fallen over the past century despite global warming.
  - Weather-related death rates are about 80 times less frequent today than a century ago.
  - The analysis of climate-related deaths includes assumptions and uncertainties.
  - Projection of 85 deaths per 100,000 in 2100 is based on an extreme emissions scenario.
  - Under a more plausible scenario, the average death rate decreases.
  - Greenstone's analysis lacks a crucial measure of a model's credibility: hindcasting.
  - Misinformation by organizations like WHO can distort perceptions of climate-related deaths.
  - Climate-related deaths are often conflated with other factors like pollution and poverty.

  - Projections suggest that climate change could impact agriculture.
  - Agricultural yields have surged over the past century despite global warming.
  - Crop yields have doubled or more for major crops since the 1960s.
  - Increasing carbon dioxide levels have contributed to yield improvements.
  - Despite climate impact projections, historical yield growth is substantial.
  - Quantitative projections of future yields are lacking in reports.
- Economic Impact
  - Economic policies, trade, technology, and governance play significant roles in economic development.
  - Economic measures are highly regional, and their uncertainties are compounded by climate uncertainties.
  - Predicting economic damage due to rising temperatures is complex and uncertain.
  - Projections of economic impacts from climate change are minimal and negligible.
  - Impact on the global economy is estimated to be 3% or less by 2100.
  - Contextualizing the impact reveals a minor decrease in annual growth rate.
  - Climate impacts on the US economy are also small, with a 5Â°C warming reducing GDP by 4%.
  - Climate impacts on the US economy are minimal relative to historical growth rates.
  - Media coverage often exaggerates climate-related economic disaster.
  - The notion of climate-related economic catastrophe persists in media and politics.

### Plans B
- Introduction and Background
  - The challenges of mitigating greenhouse gas emissions prompted interest in alternative strategies for addressing climate change.
  - Geoengineering and adaptation were identified as potential "Plan B" strategies to respond to a changing climate.
  - The importance of understanding these options, along with their benefits, drawbacks, costs, and unintended effects, was emphasized.
- Geoengineering: Solar Radiation Management (SRM)
  - Solar Radiation Management (SRM) involves enhancing Earth's albedo to reflect more sunlight and cool the planet.
  - Historical examples of inducing aerosols in the atmosphere for cooling, like volcanic eruptions, were discussed.
  - Creating a stratospheric haze through methods such as releasing hydrogen sulfide was proposed as a plausible approach.
  - SRM would have rapid rebound effects if not sustained, and it wouldn't fully counteract greenhouse gas warming.
  - Climate models suggested SRM might have varied effects on precipitation and other climate aspects, creating uncertainty.
  - Collateral effects, ethical concerns, attribution challenges, and the potential for rogue SRM were raised as issues.
  - Despite downsides, SRM was acknowledged as a subject deserving of serious research and monitoring.
- Geoengineering: Carbon Dioxide Removal (CDR)
  - Carbon Dioxide Removal (CDR) focuses on directly extracting CO2 from the atmosphere to offset emissions.
  - Different methods for capturing and storing CO2, including chemical plants and natural vegetation, were discussed.
  - The scale and cost of CDR required to make a significant impact were highlighted, along with challenges in utilization.
  - CDR could reduce the issue of assigning responsibility for emissions and allow for continued fossil fuel use.
  - The potential for financial gains without significant environmental impact was acknowledged.
- Adaptation as a Response
  - Adaptation to climate change was compared to adapting to natural phenomena like earthquakes.
  - Individual and societal adaptation efforts were described, emphasizing local, autonomous, and proportional responses.
  - Adaptation was noted as agnostic to the cause of climate change and adaptable to ongoing natural variations.
  - Societies' ability to adapt was linked to economic resources and governance, with less developed countries being more vulnerable.
  - Encouraging economic development and governance in less developed countries was identified as a way to enable global adaptation.
- Challenges and Uncertainties
  - The lack of a comprehensive framework for adaptation planning and policy analysis was highlighted.
  - Current discussions about adaptation lack cost/benefit analyses, implementation strategies, and comparisons to mitigation.
  - The need to address bureaucratic, political, and fiscal aspects of adaptation was mentioned.
  - Uncertainties in model projections of regional and local climates were noted, affecting the ability to plan for specific changes.
  - The necessity of preparing for known past climate changes and extreme weather events was underscored.
