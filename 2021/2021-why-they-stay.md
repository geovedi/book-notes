# Why They Stay
**Authors**: Anne Michaud | **Year**: 2021

## Summary
"Why They Stay" examines why accomplished political wives like Hillary Clinton, Jackie Kennedy, and Eleanor Roosevelt remained with husbands who publicly betrayed them through infidelity. Michaud introduces the "White Queen Relationship" framework, named after Elizabeth Woodville, who married King Edward IV for security and power. The book reveals that political marriages often follow different rules than civilian ones, operating as pragmatic partnerships where traditional marital intimacy may be sacrificed for political power and legacy.

This analysis of eight political couples uncovers five recurring traits that explain these women's decisions: submitting to tradition, longing for security, personal patriotism, responsibility for family emotional health, and ambition to build a legacy. The book is essential reading for anyone interested in politics, gender dynamics, or understanding the complex calculations behind high-profile relationships that shape our public discourse.

## Core Insights

### The White Queen Relationship Framework
Michaud identifies five key traits that explain why political wives stay with unfaithful husbands:

**Trait One: Submitting to Tradition**
Modern White Queens are conditioned from early life to accept patriarchal marriage norms. Many were raised to believe that male infidelity is inevitable and female loyalty is expected. Jackie Kennedy, for example, witnessed her mother accepting her father's affairs as normal, reinforcing the idea that men cheat and women endure.

**Trait Two: Longing for Security**
Many political wives experienced childhood instability that drove them to seek security through marriage. Eleanor Roosevelt's alcoholic father and emotionally abusive mother created early insecurity that made FDR's wealthy, stable world appealing despite his infidelities.

**Trait Three: Personal Patriotism**
These women often believe they're serving causes greater than themselves. Eleanor Roosevelt saw her role as helping the nation during crisis, while Hillary Clinton viewed staying with Bill as necessary to protect their shared political mission and the country's stability.

**Trait Four: Responsibility for Family Emotional Health**
The wives typically become emotional caretakers during crises. When FDR contracted polio, Eleanor stepped up despite knowing about his affairs, managing his care and their children's welfare. This pattern repeats across multiple couples.

**Trait Five: Legacy-Building Ambition**
Political wives often prioritize building lasting legacies over personal happiness. Elizabeth Woodville negotiated alliances that led to her grandson Henry VIII becoming one of England's most influential monarchs, demonstrating how strategic thinking can outweigh marital satisfaction.

### Political Marriages as Transactional Partnerships
The book argues that political marriages often function more like business arrangements than romantic unions. Donald and Melania Trump's relationship exemplifies this—he gains a beautiful wife and traditional family image, while she gains wealth and international status. Many political marriages, the book suggests, are fundamentally transactional, with emotional currency as the medium of exchange.

### The Character Question in Politics
Michaud makes a compelling case that politicians' personal conduct matters because it reveals their character. When leaders lie about affairs, voters reasonably question what else they might hide. Each scandal erodes public trust, contributing to the cynicism that plagues modern politics and depresses voter engagement.

### The Gender Double Standard
The book exposes how political careers remain more fragile for women than men. Hillary Clinton likely stayed with Bill partly because divorced women, especially those who leave popular male politicians, face insurmountable barriers to higher office. This unequal treatment perpetuates patriarchal power structures that limit women's advancement.

## Best Quotes
- "Fidelity, honesty—perhaps these were quaint ideas better suited to less ambitious people. When one had the heights of the free world practically in one's grasp, maybe the bargain at the altar became more pragmatic."

- "Private dignity at home equates to dignity in the workplace and the public sphere."

- "Many if not most marriages are transactional; they're deals forged in emotional currency, if not always a prenup."

- "The patriotic work may be a way to salvage some view of the marriage as not a waste, to resuscitate good feeling and self-respect."

- "When a politician lies about an affair, people ask themselves, what else have they lied about?"

## Action Items
- **Examine power dynamics**: In your own relationships, consider where you might be accepting unequal treatment due to traditional expectations
- **Question transactional thinking**: Evaluate whether you're sacrificing emotional intimacy for security or status
- **Support character-based leadership**: Hold public officials accountable for private conduct that reveals their true character
- **Challenge gender double standards**: Support women leaders who make difficult personal choices without harsher judgment than their male counterparts

## Questions to Consider
1. At what point does political ambition justify sacrificing personal happiness?
2. How do traditional marriage expectations continue to limit women's advancement in politics?
3. Should voters care about politicians' private conduct, or is it separate from their public service?
4. What would happen if more political women chose personal integrity over political partnership?
5. How do these high-profile examples influence ordinary women's decisions about their own relationships?

## Conclusion
"Why They Stay" is a compelling examination of the complex calculus behind political marriages facing infidelity. Michaud's White Queen framework provides valuable insights into how power, security, and ambition often outweigh traditional marital expectations in political relationships. The book challenges readers to consider whether these women made pragmatic choices or perpetuated systems that limit women's advancement.

This is worth your time because it goes beyond sensational headlines to explore deeper questions about gender, power, and integrity in public life. Michaud's rigorous reporting and compassionate analysis help readers understand that these complex decisions reflect both personal choices and systemic barriers that affect all women, not just those in the political spotlight. The biggest reason to read it is to understand how private relationship dynamics shape public power structures in ways that influence everyone's lives.
