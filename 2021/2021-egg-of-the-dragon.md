## Fast-Track Story Guide

### The Search for Answers
Mina, now serving as Lord Klodian's advisor, feels an irresistible pull toward the copper dragon she previously encountered. Despite her fears, she ventures into the desert alone, climbing a treacherous mesa to find the dragon who has been avoiding her. The scale in her leg serves as a compass and connection, humming with proximity to the massive beast.

> "She had no idea what awaited her once she finally found the dragon. The beast could easily eat her, for all she knew. She supposed that she must be a little crazy to be seeking a dragon by herself, but if she had brought Klodian on her quest, he would want to kill the dragon and claim its hoard of treasure."

### The Dragon's Revelation
When Mina finally confronts the copper dragon (named Copper), she discovers that dragons are far more intelligent and communicative than humans believe. Their telepathic connection reveals that dragons have been protecting humanity from greater threats and that an ancient dragon egg holds critical importance for both species' survival.

### War on the Horizon
Meanwhile, Caden, Mina's former friend, arrives in Velbridge after being transferred due to Thais's betrayal. He finds himself in a militaristic dominion where Lord D'Lance prepares for war against an unnamed enemy. The political subplot reveals that multiple lords are maneuvering for power while rumors of dragon-related conflicts spread.

### The Quest for the Egg
Mina learns that she must help Copper protect a special dragon egg from those who would exploit its power. This mission becomes central to preventing the approaching war and could determine the future relationship between dragons and humans.

### The Escape
The climactic scenes involve Mina choosing to ride Copper away from the mesa, flying toward an uncertain future where she must help convince dragon elders and human leaders to choose peace over conflict.
