# Since I Stopped Drinking
**Original Title**: Sinds ik niet meer drink
**Authors**: Evi Hanssen | **Year**: 2021
**Category**: Health & Medicine

## Summary
This intimate diary chronicles Belgian television presenter Evi Hanssen's 500-day journey without alcohol, beginning with a particularly humiliating New Year's Eve hangover. What starts as a one-year experiment evolves into a profound exploration of identity, social conditioning, and self-discovery. Hanssen doesn't fit the stereotype of an alcoholic—she's successful, has a loving family, and functions well in society—but like many "high-functioning" drinkers, she finds alcohol gradually eroding her happiness and authenticity.

The book reveals how deeply ingrained alcohol is in our social fabric, from family celebrations to business meetings, and how removing it forces us to confront uncomfortable truths about ourselves and our relationships. Hanssen's honest, often humorous account shows both the challenges and unexpected rewards of living sober in a world that runs on alcohol.

Perfect for anyone questioning their relationship with alcohol, dealing with "sober shame," or seeking inspiration for breaking free from social conditioning that no longer serves them.

## Core Insights

### The "High-Functioning Drinker" Doesn't Need to Hit Rock Bottom
Hanssen introduces the concept of the "highly educated, high functioning alcoholic" — someone who maintains career success, family responsibilities, and social standing while drinking too much. She never hid bottles or passed out on the couch, yet alcohol was still diminishing her quality of life through hangovers, poor decisions, and lost memories. This challenges the myth that you need to lose everything to have a drinking problem worth addressing.

> "I work, I sport, I meditate, I eat healthy, but I regularly drink too much. I don't drink every day, but almost daily. Sometimes I drink just one glass of wine, regularly that becomes two or three. I'm not an alcoholic according to societal standards, but instinctively I feel alcohol does me more harm than good."
> _Original: "Ik werk, ik sport, ik mediteer, ik eet gezond, maar ik drink regelmatig te veel. Ik drink niet elke dag, maar wel bijna dage­lijks. Soms drink ik maar één glas wijn, regelmatig worden dat er twee of drie. Ik ben geen alcoholverslaafde, en volgens de normen van onze maatschappij ben ik dat ook niet. Omdat ik instinctief aanvoel dat alcohol me meer kwaad doet dan goed."_
**Quick Take**: You don't need to meet society's definition of an alcoholic to benefit from reexamining your relationship with alcohol.

### Sober Shame: The Social Cost of Not Drinking
Hanssen coins the term "sober shame" (soberschaamte) — the feeling of embarrassment about being sober in a drinking culture. This manifests as avoiding social events, ordering mocktails that look like alcoholic drinks, or feeling pressure to explain your choice not to drink. The shame is reinforced by dismissive or denigrating comments from others about abstinence.

> "Sober shame: feeling of shame because one wants to go through life sober, or teetotal. Manifestations of sober shame include avoiding social contact, such as parties and informal gatherings, in order not to have to drink alcohol-free in public."
> _Original: "Soberschaamte: gevoel van schaamte omdat men nuchter, oftewel sober, door het leven wil gaan. Uitingsvormen van soberschaamte zijn onder andere het vermijden van sociaal contact, zoals feestelijkheden en informele bijeenkomsten, om niet in het openbaar alcoholvrij te hoeven drinken."_
**Quick Take**: The social pressure to drink is real and powerful, but recognizing it helps you resist it.

### The Discovery That Happiness Comes From Within
The most profound realization comes on day 500 when Hanssen experiences a natural high while cycling home — the same euphoric feeling she previously only got from alcohol. She discovers that the capacity for joy, freedom, and bliss was always within her, but she had been conditioned to believe it required chemical enhancement.

> "Now I feel for the first time that it was always in me, that little bottle of simple happiness. But I was too stubborn to admit that I could feel this without alcohol too. Beautiful moments are good as they are, also completely sober."
> _Original: "Nu voel ik voor het eerst dat het ­altijd in me zat, dat flesje simpel geluk. Maar dat ik te koppig was om toe te geven dat ik dit ook zonder drank kon voelen. Mooie momenten zijn goed zoals ze zijn, ook bloednuchter."_
**Quick Take**: The happiness you seek from alcohol is already accessible to you naturally.

### The Double Standard Around Alcohol
Hanssen becomes increasingly frustrated by society's double standard regarding alcohol — glorifying the fun and social aspects while ignoring or minimizing the negative consequences. This is particularly evident in how we talk to children about alcohol, celebrating drinking stories while hiding the vomiting, blackouts, and health damage.

> "Alcohol is eagerly promoted as the miracle cure to make life more fun, but the other side of the coin you rarely hear or see. Or it's laughed away."
> _Original: "Alcohol wordt gretig gepromoot als het wondermiddel om het leven leuker te maken, maar de andere kant van de medaille krijg je zelden te horen of zien. Of die wordt weggelachen."_
**Quick Take**: Challenge the selective narrative about alcohol that omits its true costs.

### Healing Your Relationship With Food and Body Image
Surprisingly, stopping alcohol leads Hanssen to develop a healthier relationship with food. After decades of calorie counting and restrictive dieting, she finally finds peace with eating — enjoying what she wants without overindulging or guilt. The alcohol had been fueling a cycle of restriction and binge eating.

> "For the first time since my puberty I don't think about what I put in my mouth anymore. I don't count calories anymore, eat what I feel like. And that's usually healthy... I have finally become a woman I used to hate: a woman who eats what she wants and still stays slim."
> _Original: "Voor het eerst sinds mijn puberteit denk ik niet meer na over wat ik in mijn mond stop. Ik tel geen calorieën meer, eet waar ik zin in heb... Ik ben nu zo'n vrouw geworden aan wie ik vroeger een hekel had: een vrouw die eet waar ze zin in heeft en toch slank blijft."_
**Quick Take**: Alcohol often masks deeper issues with food and body image that surface when you stop drinking.
