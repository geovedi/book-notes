# Living Science – 3: Decisive Experiment
**Original Title**: Living Science – 3: Decisive Experiment
**Author**: Word Rem | **Year**: 2021

## Summary
"Living Science – 3: Decisive Experiment" is a revolutionary exploration of alternative physics that challenges Einstein's Special Theory of Relativity and modern scientific dogma. The author presents decades of home-based experiments suggesting that the speed of light is not constant, that "ether" exists as a medium of "slow light," and that material objects leave ethereal traces when in motion. This book bridges experimental science with philosophical speculation, proposing a "Living Science" paradigm where all matter is interconnected and capable of storing information.

This work appeals to independent researchers, skeptics of mainstream physics, and anyone fascinated by experimental challenges to scientific orthodoxy. Readers will gain insights into alternative perspectives on light, gravity, time, and the fundamental nature of reality.

## Core Insights

### Variable Speed of Light
The book's central challenge to Einstein's second postulate of Special Relativity comes through extensive home experiments showing that light speed depends on source velocity. Using rotating discs, neon lamps, and laser interferometry, the author demonstrates that "slow" photons travel at speeds as low as 60 km/s rather than the accepted 300,000 km/s.

> "The speed of light C is added with the speed of movement of its source V according to the classical, 'ballistic' principle, and not in accordance with the SRT formulas."

**Quick Take**: If light speed varies, then Einstein's relativistic universe needs fundamental revision.

### Ether and "Hidden Light"
The author revives the concept of ether as a medium of "slow light" that surrounds and interacts with material objects. Through experiments with rotating discs and photographic plates, he demonstrates that accelerated bodies leave ethereal traces—visible duplicates and "phantoms" that can be shielded and measured.

> "We are surrounded by streams of hidden light particles that can be detected. Light substance is capable of creating structures that have zero speed relative to atoms and molecules."

**Quick Take**: Space isn't empty—it's filled with information-carrying light matter that objects constantly exchange.

### Photon Structure and Decay
Unlike the wave-particle duality of quantum mechanics, "Living Science" proposes that photons are complex electromagnetic structures that decay over time and distance. Complex photons decay first, leaving only the simplest, most stable ones that we perceive as traveling at speed C.

> "A photon is a very complex electromagnetic construction. In a sense, it is a cast of the atom, molecule, and even a macroscopic lamp that emitted it."

**Quick Take**: Light carries detailed structural information about its source, which gradually degrades with distance and time.

### Universal Synchronization
Through radio wave experiments, the author discovers a 5 MHz "frequency of the universe" that synchronizes all matter, suggesting instantaneous communication between particles that were once unified in the Big Bang.

> "A hypothesis is emerging. The entire Universe is permeated with a synchronizing rhythm. Like a computer at a clock speed."

**Quick Take**: The universe operates like a massive quantum computer with a built-in synchronization frequency.

### Form-Based Reality
In the most speculative sections, the book suggests that physical reality is fundamentally based on "forms" or information patterns. Objects can be resurrected from their past "similarities," and destroyed forms continue to influence present reality.

> "Using objects of our present, we can revive their similarities from the past. In detail, down to the atom."

**Quick Take**: Reality is informational rather than material, making transformation and resurrection theoretically possible.

## Best Quotes

- "Variable speed of light. Do-it-yourself perpetual motion machine. The device of the Time Machine. Antigravity. Communication of similar forms. Transformations of chemical elements. Teleportation. Sensational experiences in the home laboratory. Classical science. The world in a new light."

- "Light is faster than light... From the science known to us, taught in schools, has spun off, now already similar to magic, its secret peak."

- "I suggest you, reader, researcher, to disassemble the scattering of my experiments. Here, amidst rusty debris, jumbled wires, and white-light lamps, you will find the Grain."

- "The paradigm of today's science is that any experience must be reproduced... But what does Living Science say? There are no isolated processes. No materials and tools are the same."

## Action Items

- **Set up a light speed experiment**: Use a rotating disc with holes and measure light transmission at different speeds to detect "slow photons"
- **Explore ether detection**: Photograph rotating objects to capture ethereal traces and "phantoms"
- **Test universal synchronization**: Use dual-channel oscilloscopes to detect the 5 MHz cosmic frequency
- **Document form persistence**: Study how destroyed objects continue to influence their environment
- **Challenge scientific dogma**: Question fundamental assumptions in physics through independent experimentation

## Questions to Consider

- What if Einstein was wrong about light speed being constant?
- Could "ether" actually exist as slow-moving light particles?
- How might variable light speed change our understanding of space and time?
- What if all matter is interconnected through a universal frequency?
- Could information really be more fundamental than matter?

## Conclusion
"Living Science – 3" is either the work of a brilliant experimental physicist challenging century-old scientific assumptions or an elaborate collection of misinterpreted phenomena. The author's home laboratory experiments, while compelling, raise fundamental questions about the nature of scientific truth and the role of independent research in advancing knowledge.

Whether you view this as groundbreaking science or creative speculation, the book succeeds in making readers question basic assumptions about physics and reality. Its greatest value lies in demonstrating that meaningful experimental work can be conducted outside institutional settings, and that major scientific revolutions often begin with someone asking "What if?"

**Is this worth your time?** Absolutely, if you're interested in experimental physics, scientific skepticism, or the philosophy of science. The book provides both detailed experimental protocols and profound philosophical insights, making it valuable whether you're conducting your own experiments or simply expanding your understanding of what's possible in physics.
