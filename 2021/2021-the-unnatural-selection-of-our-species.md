**Authors**: Torill Kornfeldt | **Year**: 2021

## Summary
"The Unnatural Selection of Our Species" explores how revolutionary gene-editing technologies like CRISPR are transforming human evolution and medicine. Swedish science journalist Torill Kornfeldt takes readers on a global journey to meet scientists, patients, biohackers, and families at the forefront of the genetic revolution. From the first gene-edited babies in China to community labs in Brooklyn and research centers creating genetically modified pigs as "avatars" for sick children, the book examines both the incredible potential and profound ethical challenges of humanity's newfound ability to rewrite its own genetic code.

This book is perfect for anyone curious about the future of medicine, bioethics, and human evolution. Readers will gain a clear understanding of how gene-editing works, what it means for treating diseases, and why we need to think carefully about the implications of having god-like powers over our own biology.

## Core Insights

### The Gene Revolution Has Already Begun
CRISPR-Cas9, developed by Jennifer Doudna and Emmanuelle Charpentier (who won the 2020 Nobel Prize in Chemistry), has transformed genetic engineering from an expensive, complex process into something that's relatively simple and cheap enough to be used in community labs. This technology works like "gene scissors" that can cut and edit DNA with unprecedented precision, opening up possibilities for curing genetic diseases and modifying living organisms.

> "The discovery made by these two scientists, Jennifer Doudna and Emmanuelle Charpentier, is actually quite simple: a chemical device developed by bacteria can be turned into a tool that we humans can use. Yet that tool – the 'gene scissors' CRISPR-Cas9 – has transformed our potential future."

**Quick Take**: The genetic revolution isn't coming—it's already here, and most people haven't realized it yet.

### Two Narratives Shape Our Understanding: Frankenstein vs. Star Trek
Our approach to gene technology is shaped by two competing stories: the Frankenstein narrative warns about scientists "playing God" and creating uncontrollable consequences, while Star Trek represents optimism about technology solving human problems and elevating us to a better future. Kornfeldt argues we need both perspectives—enthusiasm about the potential to cure diseases, and caution about unintended consequences.

> "The problem isn't that both Star Trek and Frankenstein are science fiction, it's that they're true. Our view of science has two main facets: on the one hand, anxiety that progress will be too rapid and have fatal consequences, and, on the other, hope that progress can free us from suffering and barbarity."

**Quick Take**: We need to balance excitement about genetic cures with healthy skepticism about where this technology might lead.

### Biohackers Are Democratizing Gene Technology
A growing movement of "biohackers" and community labs is making gene technology accessible to ordinary people, not just well-funded institutions. From Genspace in Brooklyn (the world's first community lab) to controversial figures like Josiah Zayner who injected himself with CRISPR on live YouTube, this movement believes genetic tools should be available to everyone. While this democratization raises safety concerns, it also empowers patients with rare diseases who have no other options.

> "I think there's a feeling of powerlessness behind a lot of the pushback on things like GMO foods and I believe that the more we involve the public, not just in decision-making, but in the actual scientific process, the better it'll be for our society."

**Quick Take**: Gene technology is becoming accessible to the public, bringing both opportunities for innovation and risks of misuse.

### The Medical Promise Is Astonishing—But Not Guaranteed
Gene therapy shows remarkable promise for treating or curing diseases that were previously untreatable. From curing "bubble boy disease" in infants to potentially ending HIV and AIDS, CRISPR offers hope for millions. However, significant challenges remain in delivering gene therapies to the right cells, ensuring safety, and making treatments accessible and affordable. Scientists dream of curing "absolutely everything," but reality may be more complicated.

> "Potential' is precisely the word you need to bear in mind when you hear about their dreams: all very promising and enticing, but nothing's yet certain."

**Quick Take**: Gene therapy could revolutionize medicine, but we're still in the early stages of understanding both its capabilities and limitations.

### Personalized Genetic Research Through "Avatars"
Scientists are creating genetically modified animals that carry exact copies of individual patients' genetic mutations. These "avatar" animals, like pigs bred to have the same NF1 gene mutation as specific children, allow researchers to test treatments on personalized disease models before using them on humans. This approach represents a radical shift from one-size-fits-all medicine to truly personalized treatment development.

> "Modified with CRISPR, these animals become representatives of sick children, patients. This enables the scientists to get a sense of how the disease will develop, since pigs grow up faster than we do, and allows them to test the impact of various drugs."

**Quick Take**: We're moving toward personalized medicine where drugs are tested on your genetic twin before you ever take them.

### The Ethical Boundaries Are Blurry
The book forces us to confront difficult questions about where we draw the line between therapy and enhancement. Should we eliminate genes that increase cancer risk? What about traits like red hair that come with higher skin cancer risk? Who gets to decide which traits are undesirable? Kornfeldt shares her personal reflection on having red hair and freckles—traits she likes but that increase her disease risk.

> "Where is the dividing line between what's ethically defensible and what isn't, if we start eliminating genes that cause diseases and other problems?"

**Quick Take**: The line between fixing what's "wrong" and enhancing what's "different" is dangerously subjective.

## Best Quotes

- "We now have the capacity to redraw the blueprint of our own species, along with that of all the animals and plants in the world. We can transform our own genetic makeup and design living beings that have never existed before."

- "The problem isn't that both Star Trek and Frankenstein are science fiction, it's that they're true. Our view of science has two main facets: on the one hand, anxiety that progress will be too rapid and have fatal consequences, and, on the other, hope that progress can free us from suffering and barbarity."

- "Potential' is precisely the word you need to bear in mind when you hear about their dreams: all very promising and enticing, but nothing's yet certain."

- "I'm happy with my freckles, my hair colour and my pale-pink complexion. These are fundamental parts of who I am, which I would never want to change."

- "We still know very little about what happens inside our cells and the possible impact of tinkering with our genes. That's not necessarily an argument for inaction – rather the reverse. But it is a reason to be cautious and aware of our limitations."

## Key Takeaways

- **Gene technology is already here**: CRISPR has made genetic engineering accessible enough for use outside major laboratories, meaning the genetic revolution is happening now, not in some distant future.

- **Medical breakthroughs are imminent**: Gene therapies are already curing previously untreatable diseases like SCID-X1 ("bubble boy disease") and showing promise for everything from HIV to cancer.

- **Democratization brings risks and rewards**: As gene technology becomes more accessible, it empowers patients and citizen scientists but also raises safety concerns about DIY genetic modifications.

- **Ethical questions need public debate**: We need society-wide conversations about where to draw the line between therapy and enhancement, and who gets to make these decisions.

- **We're just beginning**: Despite the amazing power of new gene-editing tools, our understanding of genetics is still in its infancy compared to the complexity of what we're manipulating.

## Questions to Consider

- If you could eliminate genetic traits that increase disease risk in your children, would you do it? Where would you draw the line between prevention and enhancement?

- Should gene-editing technology be restricted to medical professionals, or should it be available to anyone who wants to experiment on themselves?

- How do we ensure that gene therapy benefits everyone, not just the wealthy? Who should pay for these revolutionary but expensive treatments?

- Is it ethical to create genetically modified animals as disease "avatars" for humans, even if it could lead to cures?

- How might our ability to edit the human genome change what it means to be human over the coming decades?

## Conclusion

"The Unnatural Selection of Our Species" is essential reading for anyone trying to understand one of the most transformative technologies of our time. Kornfeldt's skillful blend of personal stories, scientific explanation, and ethical reflection makes complex genetic technology accessible and compelling.
