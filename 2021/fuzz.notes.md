  - Douglas fir trees have a slow life cycle, including a long period of dying and decomposition.
  - Decomposition of trees can take decades, with various stages such as "dead hard," "dead spongy," and "dead soft."
  - Trees that fall near roads or buildings can become dangerous and are referred to as "danger trees."
  - Falling branches or trees pose risks, especially during storms or high winds.
- Tree-Related Fatalities and Injuries:
  - People, especially loggers, are at risk of fatalities and injuries from falling trees.
  - "Falling Safety Advisors" are tasked with ensuring safe practices in the logging industry.
  - Chainsaw operators (fallers) face a much higher risk of on-the-job fatalities compared to other professions.
  - Overmature and rotting trees contribute to hazardous conditions.
- Felling Techniques and Safety Measures:
  - Techniques like undercutting and sloping are used to control the direction of a tree's fall.
  - Rotting trees are harder to control during felling, increasing the risk to fallers.
  - "Danger trees" are often not cut down but are blown up using explosives to mitigate risks.
  - Elderly trees undergo retrenchment, where the crown thins and limbs die back to reduce windthrow risk.
- Wildlife and Ecology of Dying Trees:
  - Decaying trees provide habitat for wildlife, with rot-hollowed trunks becoming dens for bears.
  - Dead branches become hunting perches for raptors, and rotting sapwood is used by woodpeckers for nesting.
  - Trees marked as "danger trees" can also be important as "wildlife trees" for ecological reasons.
- Explosives and Tree Management:
  - Controlled explosions are used to remove upper portions of trees, making them safer while preserving their appearance.
  - Explosives facilitate decay by allowing rainwater to seep into the tree's interior.
  - Monitoring and management of tree health involve assessing rot, insect infestations, and signs of danger.
- Awe and Emotional Connection to Trees:
  - The joy of controlled explosions and extreme actions is part of human fascination with awe-inspiring events.
  - People often have emotional connections to certain branches of life, such as trees, even though they are vulnerable.
- Conservation and Lesser-Known Species:
  - Conservation efforts often focus on charismatic or economically valuable species rather than lesser-known ones.
  - Many critically endangered species, like the Abrau sprat and eightgill hagfish, are overlooked in fundraising campaigns.

## The Terror Beans: The Legume as Accomplice to Murder
- Development and Testing of Toxic Substances for Pest Control:
  - During World War II, toxic substances like sodium fluoroacetate (1080) were developed for pest control.
  - 1080 was highly toxic, causing gruesome deaths in animals, making it unsuitable for use in warfare.
  - Testing involved using bait laced with 1080 and monitoring its effects on rats and other pests.
  - The desire for efficient pest control led to experimentation with various bait recipes and delivery methods.
  - Dogs and other non-target animals were also affected by the poison, leading to the need for modifications.
