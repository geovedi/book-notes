## Fast-Track Story Guide

### The Setup: A Magical Bargain
The Sultan of Persia is celebrating the New Year when an Indian appears with a mechanical horse that can fly anywhere instantly. When the Sultan wants to buy it, the Indian demands the Sultan's daughter in exchange. Prince Firouz Schah, the heir, is outraged by this insolent request, but his father is tempted by the magical horse.

### The Mistake: An Uncontrolled Flight
Prince Firouz tests the horse without waiting for proper instructions, accidentally launching himself into the sky. Unable to control the descent, he eventually lands on a palace terrace in Bengal, where he discovers the beautiful Princess sleeping. Their immediate connection blossoms into love as he explains his magical predicament.

### The Betrayal: The Indian's Revenge
Months later, when the Prince and Princess return to Persia on the enchanted horse, the newly-freed Indian exacts his revenge. He tricks the Princess into riding with him, then kidnaps her, flying her toward Cashmere where he plans to sell her to the Sultan.

### The Rescue: A Clever Disguise
After the Indian is killed and the Princess captured by the Sultan of Cashmere, she feigns madness to avoid marriage. Prince Firouz, wandering in disguise as a physician, finds her and recognizes her trickery. Together they devise a plan to escape during a supposed "healing ceremony" involving the enchanted horse.
