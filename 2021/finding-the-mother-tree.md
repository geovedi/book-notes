## Alder Swales

In this chapter, titled "Alder Swales," Suzie continues her research on the relationship between alder and pine in the forest ecosystem. She and her team measure soil water, nutrient levels, and the growth of pine seedlings in different treatments involving alder presence or absence. Suzie discovers that alder plays a crucial role in providing water and nitrogen to pine through a complex network of mycorrhizal fungi.

She learns that the mycorrhizal fungi connect the roots of alder and pine, facilitating the transfer of nutrients, particularly nitrogen, from the nitrogen-rich alder to the nitrogen-depleted pine. This direct link explains why pine seedlings thrive when growing alongside alder and suffer when alder is removed.

Suzie realizes that policymakers and the forest industry often overlook the intricate ecological interactions and focus solely on short-term gains. She discusses her findings with her mentor, Don, and they discuss the implications for sustainable forest management and agriculture.

Despite the data supporting the benefits of alder for pine growth, Suzie knows she needs more long-term evidence to convince others. She contemplates how to effectively communicate her research findings and bring about positive change in forest management practices.

The chapter concludes with Suzie and Don biking home, reflecting on the challenges ahead and their determination to advocate for a more holistic approach to forestry that recognizes the importance of symbiotic relationships and long-term sustainability.

## Radioactive

In this chapter titled "Radioactive," the protagonist, Suzie, and her friend Barb embark on a field experiment for Suzie's doctoral research. They set up shade tents in a clear-cut area to investigate the relationship between paper birch and Douglas fir trees. Suzie wants to determine whether birch trees act as competitors or collaborators with fir trees, and if they contribute resources to support fir's growth.

They carefully place the shade tents over the designated triplets of birch, fir, and cedar seedlings, creating a gradient of light reaching the firs. Suzie believes that if birch and fir are connected through mycorrhizal fungi, there might be an exchange of carbon and other nutrients between them.

After weeks of monitoring and measurements, they discover that the shaded fir seedlings are photosynthesizing at a much lower rate than those in full sunlight. Furthermore, the fully illuminated birches are photosynthesizing at a higher rate than the firs, indicating a source-sink gradient between the two species.

Excited by these preliminary results, Suzie and her research associate, Dan, conduct labeling experiments using isotopes to trace carbon movement between the trees. They find initial evidence that birch and fir are communicating and exchanging carbon.

However, amidst Suzie's scientific breakthroughs, she receives devastating news of the sudden death of her brother, Kelly. The chapter concludes with Suzie grappling with grief and regret, reflecting on their strained relationship and the finality of their parting words.
