## Summary
"The Witch's Heart" reimagines Norse mythology from the perspective of Angrboda, the giantess traditionally known as Loki's lover and mother of monsters. After being burned three times by the gods and losing her heart, Angrboda flees to Ironwood seeking a peaceful life. There she meets Loki, the trickster god, and they form an unlikely relationship that leads to the birth of three prophesied children: Hel, the half-dead ruler of the underworld; Fenrir, the destined wolf who will kill Odin; and Jormungand, the world-serpent who will battle Thor.

This novel transforms mythological villains into complex, sympathetic characters, focusing on themes of motherhood, fate, sacrifice, and finding family in unexpected places. It's a story about choosing love over destiny and the fierce determination to protect those you care about, even when the entire world expects them to bring about its destruction.

Readers who enjoy mythological retellings, character-driven fantasy, and stories that challenge traditional notions of good and evil will find this novel deeply moving. It offers fresh perspectives on familiar Norse myths while exploring universal themes of love, loss, and defiance against predetermined destinies.

## Essential Plot

The story begins with Angrboda recovering from being burned three times by the Aesir gods for practicing witchcraft and teaching seid (prophecy magic). She retreats to Ironwood, where she meets Loki, who returns her still-smoking heart that he had taken. Despite their initial wariness, they develop an unusual friendship that blossoms into romance.

Angrboda settles into a cave home and builds a life with the help of new friends Skadi (the huntress giantess) and Gerd (another giantess). She eventually has three children with Loki: Hel (born with a condition that causes parts of her body to appear dead), Fenrir (a wolf-child who communicates telepathically), and Jormungand (a serpent who grows rapidly). Each child corresponds to creatures Angrboda has seen in visions of Ragnarok, the doom of the gods.

The middle sections explore Angrboda's struggles as a mother - trying to protect her children from their fates while dealing with their unique challenges. Hel's legs gradually deteriorate despite Angrboda's healing attempts, Fenrir struggles with his wolf instincts, and Jormungand eventually becomes too large to keep in Ironwood.

The climax occurs when the gods, having discovered who Angrboda's children are, come to take them away. Angrboda uses her magic to separate the children's spirits from their bodies to preserve their memories, sacrificing herself in the process. She experiences a vision of her children's eventual roles in Ragnarok before being saved by her friends.

The novel concludes with Angrboda returning to Ironwood, having made peace with her children's destinies while cherishing the time they had together. The ending is bittersweet - accepting that while her children are destined to bring about the end of the world, they will also bring about its rebirth.

## Key Characters

**Angrboda**: The protagonist, an ancient witch who has been burned and reborn multiple times. She's trying to escape her prophetic abilities and live a quiet life, but motherhood forces her to confront destiny head-on.

**Loki**: The trickster god, portrayed here as more complex than traditional villain. He's genuinely devoted to his family despite his chaotic nature and divided loyalties between Asgard and Ironwood.

**Hel**: Angrboda's daughter, born with a condition that makes parts of her body appear dead. She's thoughtful and empathetic, destined to rule the Norse underworld.

**Fenrir**: The wolf-child who communicates telepathically. He struggles with his animal instincts and grows rapidly, eventually becoming too large to contain in Ironwood.

**Jormungand**: The serpent son who grows to enormous size. He represents both danger and protection, ultimately destined to encircle the world.

**Skadi**: The huntress giantess who becomes Angrboda's closest friend and trading partner. She's practical, fiercely loyal, and represents found family.

## Core Themes

**Motherhood and Sacrifice**: The novel explores the fierce protective instinct of a mother willing to defy gods and destiny to protect her children, even when those children are destined to destroy the world.

**Fate vs. Free Will**: Characters struggle against predetermined destinies, questioning whether prophecy is inevitable or can be changed through love and determination.

**Found Family**: Beyond blood relations, the story emphasizes the importance of chosen family - the bonds formed between Angrboda, Skadi, and Gerd provide crucial support and love.

**Redemption of Villains**: The novel successfully reimagines traditional mythological villains as sympathetic characters with complex motivations and relatable human emotions.

## Takeaways

- True strength lies in choosing love over fear, even when facing impossible odds
- Family comes in many forms - sometimes the strongest bonds are those we choose rather than those we're born into
- Acceptance doesn't mean giving up - sometimes the bravest act is loving someone despite knowing how their story must end
- Even in darkness, there's beauty to be found in the moments we share with those we love

## Questions to Consider

- If you could see your children's destinies, would you try to change them or help them face them?
- Can love truly defy fate, or are some outcomes inevitable?
- What makes someone a "villain" - their actions or the perspectives from which their stories are told?
- How do we find hope in stories that acknowledge that endings, even tragic ones, make way for new beginnings?

## Conclusion

"The Witch's Heart" is a beautifully written mythological retelling that succeeds in humanizing characters traditionally depicted as one-dimensional villains. Genevieve Gornichec has crafted a story that feels both epic in scope and deeply intimate in its exploration of love, loss, and motherhood.

The novel's greatest strength is its emotional resonance - readers will find themselves invested in Angrboda's journey and genuinely caring about characters they might have previously viewed only as monsters. The pacing is deliberate but engaging, and the prose balances poetic language with accessible storytelling.

This is absolutely worth your time if you enjoy mythology retellings, character-driven fantasy, or stories that challenge traditional narratives about good and evil. The biggest reason to read it is to experience Norse mythology from a completely fresh perspective that will likely change how you view these ancient stories forever.
