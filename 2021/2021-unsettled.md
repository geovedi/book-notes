# Unsettled
**Authors**: Steven E. Koonin | **Year**: 2021

## Summary
"Unsettled" is a provocative examination of climate science that challenges the prevailing narrative of a "climate crisis." Written by Steven Koonin, a physicist who served as undersecretary for science in the Obama administration, the book argues that while the globe is warming and humans exert some influence, the science is far less settled than commonly portrayed. Koonin reveals how scientific uncertainties are often obscured in public communication, leading to distorted policy discussions based on exaggerated claims rather than evidence-based analysis.

This book is essential for anyone seeking a more nuanced understanding of climate science beyond the headlines. It's particularly valuable for policymakers, concerned citizens, and those who want to separate scientific facts from political narratives. Readers will gain the tools to think critically about climate claims and understand the gap between what research shows and what media reports.

## Core Insights

### The Science Isn't Settled
Despite constant claims that "the science is settled," climate science remains immature in many crucial areas. Koonin discovered through extensive analysis that climate models disagree with each other and observations, data deficiencies challenge our understanding, and official summaries often misrepresent the underlying research. The science is insufficient to make reliable projections about future climate or the effects of our actions.

> "I do not think 'The Science' says what you think it says."

**Quick Take**: The certainty portrayed in media and political discussions masks significant scientific uncertainties that are crucial for policy decisions.

### Surprising Climate Facts
Several commonly held beliefs about climate change contradict official assessments:

- Heat waves in the US are now no more common than in 1900, and the warmest temperatures haven't risen in 50 years
- Humans have had no detectable impact on hurricanes over the past century
- Greenland's ice sheet isn't shrinking any more rapidly than 80 years ago
- The net economic impact of human-induced climate change will be minimal through 2100
- Global area burned by fires has declined 25% since 1998

> "For example, both the research literature and government reports that summarize and assess the state of climate science say clearly that heat waves in the US are now no more common than they were in 1900, and that the warmest temperatures in the US have not risen in the past fifty years."

**Quick Take**: Many alarming climate claims don't match the evidence found in official assessment reports.

### The Communication Breakdown
Most of the disconnect between scientific reality and public perception comes from a "game of telephone" - research literature → assessment reports → summaries → media coverage. At each step, information becomes distorted, simplified, or exaggerated. This serves various interests: environmental groups need funding, media need stories, politicians need issues, and scientists need grants.

> "Most of the disconnect comes from the long game of telephone that starts with the research literature and runs through the assessment reports to the summaries of the assessment reports and on to the media coverage."

**Quick Take**: The information chain from research to public consistently filters out uncertainty and exaggerates impacts.

### The Feynman Standard
Scientific integrity requires presenting all relevant information, not just facts that support one narrative. Richard Feynman's "Cargo Cult Science" principles emphasize giving complete information to help others judge value, not just information leading to one particular conclusion. Much climate communication fails this test by withholding essential context.

> "Much of the public portrayal of climate science suffers from Feynman's Wesson Oil problem—in an effort to persuade rather than inform, the information presented withholds either essential context or what doesn't 'fit.'"

**Quick Take**: Scientific communication should inform, not persuade - a standard often violated in climate discussions.

### The Double Ethical Bind
Scientists face a conflict between their ethical obligation to truth and their desire to drive policy action. Some explicitly argue for exaggerating threats to achieve political goals, believing ends justify means. This corrupts the scientific process and undermines public trust.

> "So we have to offer up scary scenarios, make simplified, dramatic statements, and make little mention of any doubts we might have."

**Quick Take**: When scientists prioritize activism over accuracy, they betray both their profession and the public interest.

## Best Quotes

- "The Science.' We're all supposed to know what 'The Science' says. 'The Science,' we're told, is settled."

- "Humans have already broken the earth's climate. Temperatures are rising, sea level is surging, ice is disappearing, and heat waves, storms, droughts, floods, and wildfires are an ever-worsening scourge on the world. Greenhouse gas emissions are causing all of this. And unless they're eliminated promptly by radical changes to society and its energy systems, 'The Science' says Earth is doomed. Well . . . not quite."

- "In short, the science is insufficient to make useful projections about how the climate will change over the coming decades, much less what effect our actions will have on it."

- "We scientists shouldn't be selling cooking oil."

- "Uncertainty is a prime mover and motivator of science and must be faced head-on."

- "When you see something that is not right, not just, not fair, you have a moral obligation to say something, do something."

- "It doesn't matter what is true, it only matters what people believe is true."

## Action Items

### For Critical Thinking
- Read original assessment reports rather than media summaries
- Question scientific claims that lack uncertainty acknowledgment
- Distinguish between data and interpretation in climate discussions
- Look for what's omitted as well as what's included in scientific communication

### For Better Understanding
- Learn the difference between weather and climate
- Understand the limits of computer models for complex systems
- Recognize the difference between correlation and causation
- Appreciate the role of natural climate variability

### For Informed Citizenship
- Support research that improves climate science understanding
- Advocate for transparent communication of uncertainties
- Demand cost-benefit analysis of climate policies
- Promote adaptation strategies alongside mitigation efforts

## Questions to Consider

- If the science is truly settled, why do scientists need to exaggerate or omit inconvenient facts?
- How much should we spend on potential future problems versus current urgent needs?
- Who benefits from climate alarmism, and who loses?
- What's the appropriate balance between environmental protection and economic development?
- How can we improve scientific communication to serve public understanding rather than political agendas?

## Conclusion
"Unsettled" is a courageous and necessary book that challenges readers to think more critically about climate science and policy. Koonin's insider perspective and scientific credentials give his critique weight and credibility. While some will dismiss him as a "denier," he never denies warming or human influence - only the certainty and severity commonly portrayed.

The book's greatest strength is its insistence on scientific integrity and open debate. Koonin demonstrates that many widely held climate beliefs don't match the evidence in official reports, and that the communication process systematically filters out uncertainty. This leads to policy discussions based on fear rather than facts.

This is absolutely worth reading if you want to understand climate science beyond the political narratives. The biggest reason to read it is that it equips you to evaluate climate claims critically and distinguish between scientific knowledge and political advocacy. In an era where trillion-dollar decisions are being made based on climate projections, understanding the limits of our knowledge isn't just intellectually honest - it's essential for good governance.

The book doesn't claim climate change isn't real or that humans have no influence. Rather, it argues that we know less than we think, and that honest acknowledgment of uncertainty would lead to better, more nuanced policies. As Koonin shows throughout, the gap between what scientists know and what the public is told is vast - and closing that gap is crucial for both scientific integrity and effective policy.
