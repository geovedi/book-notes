# 2021-Leading People in Change
**Authors**: Jennifer Bryan | **Year**: 2021

## Summary
"Leading People in Change" is a practical guide that challenges the conventional approach to change management by putting people at the center of the process. Bryan argues that change management has become too focused on methodologies and technology, often neglecting the human element that is critical for success. Drawing from twenty years of experience working with over thirty organizations, she presents the ABChange Model - a framework that links leadership styles with specific change skills to help leaders effectively guide their teams through transformation.

This book is essential for managers and leaders at all levels who are responsible for implementing change initiatives. Readers will gain a clear understanding of how to adapt their leadership style to different change situations, build trust and collaboration, and overcome resistance through authentic communication and strategic sponsorship.

## Core Insights

### Change Management Is About People, Not Processes
The fundamental premise of the book is that effective change management prioritizes human behavior over technical solutions. Bryan argues that leaders often get "seduced by the glitter of the gizmo" and forget that people are the ones who make change successful. The people side of change is frequently treated as an afterthought, only noticed when things go wrong.

> "Change management is about people, and this statement of the obvious too often gets lost in over-complicated methodologies and technology-focused approaches to change."

**Quick Take**: Before implementing any change initiative, assess your team's emotional readiness and create a human-centered strategy that addresses their needs and concerns.

### The ABChange Model: Linking Leadership Style to Change Type
The core framework of the book is the ABChange Model, which connects different types of change with appropriate leadership styles and required skills. Based on research linking Goleman's leadership styles with Kanter's change agent skills, the model helps managers identify what type of change they're facing and adapt their approach accordingly.

The model emphasizes that change skills are not a checklist but interconnected capabilities that often happen simultaneously. Leaders must define what each skill means to them personally and understand how different situations require different leadership approaches.

**Quick Take**: First identify your change type, then match your leadership style and prioritize the most critical skills for that specific situation.

### Sponsorship: The Number One Success Factor
Citing research from Creasey and Hiatt, Bryan emphasizes that sponsorship is the single most important factor for successful change. However, many organizations fail to understand the critical role leadership plays in change implementation. Effective sponsorship requires more than just approval - it demands active, visible involvement.

The right sponsor must have influence on senior executives and the authority to allocate resources. Leaders must build enthusiasm throughout the entire network, including executive sponsors, managers, champions, project teams, and key stakeholders.

**Quick Take**: Identify and empower the right change sponsor who has both influence and resource authority, then ensure they remain visibly active throughout the process.

### Communication: Quality Over Quantity
While many believe change management is simply good communication, Bryan argues it's about the quality, timing, and authenticity of communication. Clear, concise, and genuine communication can counteract resistance, misconceptions, and misperceptions. Leaders must consider not just what they communicate, but how, when, and through what channels.

> "There cannot be any learning without change, and no change without learning."

The Kübler-Ross model demonstrates that people process change through different emotional stages, and communication must be tailored to meet people where they are in their journey.

**Quick Take**: Focus on authentic communication that explains the 'why' behind change, and give people time to process information and ask questions.

### Building Trust as the Foundation
Using the CIPD's "Pillars of Trust" framework, Bryan identifies four critical elements for building trust during change: ability, benevolence, integrity, and predictability. Leaders must demonstrate competence, show genuine concern for their team, act with consistency, and maintain predictable behavior patterns.

Trust building requires emotional intelligence, confidence, and strong influencing skills. Without trust, even the best-designed change initiatives will face resistance and potential failure.

**Quick Take**: Invest in building trust before, during, and after change initiatives through consistent behavior and genuine concern for team welfare.

## Conclusion
"Leading People in Change" is worth your time because it provides a refreshingly human-centered approach to an often overly-process-driven discipline. Bryan's ABChange Model offers a practical framework that leaders can immediately apply, moving beyond theory to actionable strategies.

The book's greatest strength is its emphasis on flexibility and situational leadership - recognizing that there's no one-size-fits-all approach to change management. By linking specific leadership styles with change skills and situations, Bryan provides a roadmap that managers can follow while still allowing for personal adaptation.

For anyone responsible for leading people through transformation, this book offers both the philosophical foundation and practical tools needed to succeed where many change initiatives fail: in winning hearts and minds rather than just implementing processes.
