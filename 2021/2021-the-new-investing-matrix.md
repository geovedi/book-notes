# The New Investing Matrix
**Authors**: Wayne Walker | **Year**: 2021

## Summary
"The New Investing Matrix" presents a revolutionary approach to investment strategy that expands beyond traditional asset classes to include the most valuable asset of all: yourself. Wayne Walker, a seasoned capital markets expert, challenges conventional wisdom by positioning personal development alongside stocks, bonds, and cryptocurrencies in a comprehensive investment framework. The book systematically builds an updated investment matrix for 2021 and beyond, arguing that true wealth creation requires nurturing both financial and personal assets while maintaining emotional discipline and strategic diversification across multiple investment vehicles including emerging digital assets.

This guide is perfect for investors of all experience levels who want to build a resilient portfolio that can thrive in modern markets. Readers will gain practical insights into value investing, cryptocurrency allocation, real estate strategies, and the often-overlooked importance of personal development as an investment class. The book's holistic approach helps investors create sustainable wealth while protecting their most valuable asset—themselves.

## Core Insights

### You Are Your Most Important Asset Class
The book's revolutionary premise is that personal development should be treated as a primary investment class. Walker argues that without investing in yourself first, all other investments become vulnerable. This includes ensuring adequate sleep (7-9 hours per 24-hour cycle), practicing intermittent fasting for increased energy and reduced body fat, learning foreign languages to expand personal and business opportunities, and committing to continuous learning throughout life. The author notes that ongoing learning keeps mental faculties sharp and can delay cognitive decline, making it both a personal and financial investment.

> "We do not step into or just arrive into the future; we create it from what we are doing today."
**Quick Take**: Your personal health, skills, and knowledge directly impact your investment returns. Protect and develop yourself first.

### Value Investing: Finding Bargains in a Noisy Market
Value investing focuses on finding companies trading below their intrinsic worth through fundamental analysis. Unlike simply buying falling stocks, true value investing requires deep research into a company's actual value relative to its current price. Walker provides the intrinsic value formula: Intrinsic Value = Current Earnings x (8.5 + 2 x Expected Annual Growth Rate). The strategy emphasizes long-term ownership of quality companies rather than short-term price speculation, following principles successfully applied by Warren Buffett at Berkshire Hathaway.

> "Value investors see a stock as a way through which a person becomes part or full owner of a company. They buy or invest in a company not just a stock."
**Quick Take**: Look for fundamentally strong companies that the market has undervalued, not just stocks that have dropped in price.

### Cryptocurrency: Legitimate Asset Class or Fad?
Walker presents compelling evidence that cryptocurrencies, particularly Bitcoin and Ethereum, have evolved from speculative novelties to legitimate investment assets. He notes that Bitcoin has "died" over 150 times according to media reports, yet continues to demonstrate remarkable resilience and returns. The book recommends focusing on liquid cryptocurrencies (Bitcoin, Ethereum, Ripple, Tether, Litecoin, EOS, and Bitcoin Cash) and emphasizes diversification within the crypto space. Cryptocurrencies serve as portfolio hedges due to their low correlation with traditional assets.

> "The reduction in the early hype has helped to mature the market to the point that it is now a legitimate asset class."
**Quick Take**: Include cryptocurrencies in your portfolio, but focus on established, liquid options and maintain proper diversification.

### Strategic Asset Allocation: The Investor's Blind Spot
Most investors fail at optimal asset allocation—the strategy of dividing investments among different asset classes to maximize returns while minimizing risk. Walker ranks assets from low to high risk: Money markets, investment-grade bonds, large-cap stocks, mid-cap stocks, small-cap stocks, and emerging markets. He provides model portfolios ranging from very aggressive (80-100% stocks) to conservative (70-75% fixed-income securities). The key is matching allocation to your risk tolerance, time frame, and financial goals.

> "Your aim as an investor is to maximize returns while keeping risk at the lowest level possible. Simple, but not easy."
**Quick Take**: Create portfolio models based on your risk profile and rebalance quarterly to maintain your target allocation.

### Index Funds Outperform Active Management
The book presents overwhelming evidence that index funds consistently outperform actively managed funds over the long term. While some active funds may outperform initially, their higher expenses from frequent trading and larger management teams typically erase any advantages. Index funds offer lower expense ratios, better tax efficiency, and more predictable market-matching returns. ETFs provide similar benefits with added flexibility for intraday trading and more accurate pricing throughout the day.

> "The majority of actively managed funds underperform the market and fail to beat index funds."
**Quick Take**: Choose low-cost index funds or ETFs for core portfolio holdings rather than attempting to beat the market with active managers.

### Real Estate: Keep It Simple and Profitable
Walker advocates for straightforward real estate investing focused on rental properties rather than complicated strategies like house flipping. He recommends buying properties only if you plan to hold them for at least five years, preferably for rental income. For those starting out, renting a room in your current residence or using REITs (Real Estate Investment Trusts) provides easier entry points. The author emphasizes buying with cash when possible to secure better prices and avoid overextending with credit.

> "Real estate is the asset class where the less complicated that you keep it the better off you are."
**Quick Take**: Focus on rental properties for long-term income and appreciation, avoiding complex flipping strategies shown on TV.

### Entrepreneurship: The Overlooked Investment Strategy
Walker includes entrepreneurship as an essential component of a comprehensive investment strategy. He recommends starting businesses part-time while maintaining employment to reduce financial risk. Successful businesses must be scalable—able to handle dramatic increases in volume with proportional ease. The author emphasizes that business skills require deliberate practice and coaching, particularly in connecting sales and marketing efforts with clients' end goals. Mindset and perseverance are identified as critical success factors.

> "What you harvest in six months or six years, fairly or unfairly, is mostly from what you are planting now."
**Quick Take**: Develop a scalable side business while employed, focusing on providing genuine value rather than chasing funding.
