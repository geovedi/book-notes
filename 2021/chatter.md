***

The book "Chatter" by Ethan Kross explores the phenomenon of the inner voice and its impact on our well-being. The inner voice serves multiple functions and is intertwined with language and self-control. It helps construct our identities, navigate the world, and communicate experiences. However, it can also become overwhelming and lead to adverse effects such as rumination and mood disturbance. Understanding the harmful effects of chatter is crucial for managing and harnessing its power for mental well-being.

The book discusses examples that illustrate the consequences of negative inner voices. Rick Ankiel's experience highlights how the inner voice can disrupt automatic behaviours and lead to performance issues. The adverse effects of chatter extend to social interactions, both online and offline, where excessive sharing of negative thoughts can strain relationships. Chronic stress fueled by negative self-talk and repetitive thinking has physical implications, affecting cardiovascular health, sleep, and immune function. However, there are also examples of resilience and overcoming hardships through social connections and healthy coping mechanisms.

The author explores various strategies for managing chatter, including distanced self-talk. By saying one's name in the head, individuals can gain perspective, reduce negative emotions, and improve performance in stressful situations. The book also discusses the power of rituals and placebos in combating chatter. Whether cultural or personal, rituals provide a sense of control, order, and meaning, while placebos can produce positive effects based on suggestion and belief. Integrating scientific knowledge of these tools into our culture is essential for utilising their potential and improving well-being.

## Why We Talk to Ourselves

In a study conducted by anthropologist Andrew Irving, the inner voices of over a hundred New Yorkers were examined and compared to those of people with HIV/AIDS. Participants were asked to express their thoughts, providing insights into their inner conversations as they navigated daily life. The recordings revealed a range of ideas, including mundane observations, personal wounds, distress, worries, and harmful content. The inner voice often shifted abruptly from everyday concerns to life and death, reflecting on the past and projecting into the future. This inner voice is a fundamental feature of the human mind, aiding in understanding and communicating experiences.

The inner voice serves multiple functions and is intertwined with language and self-control. It is part of the brain's phonological loop, responsible for managing verbal information in working memory. The development of language and self-control is influenced by upbringing and cultural factors, with imaginary play and rich communication patterns playing a role in the early development of inner speech. The inner voice helps construct our identities by creating narratives and storifying our lives. With verbal thoughts, our ability to navigate and function would be improved.

However, the inner voice can also become overwhelming and have adverse effects. Ruminative thoughts can overshadow positive experiences and impact our mood and perception. Understanding the harmful effects of chatter is essential to intervene and gain control over our verbal and mental stream. By exploring the inner voice and its influence, we can better manage and harness its power for our mental well-being.


## When Talking to Ourselves Backfires

Rick Ankiel's baseball career took a turn when his inner voice overwhelmed him with negative thoughts and anxiety, leading to a meltdown during a game. This highlights the vulnerability of automatic behaviours when the inner voice disrupts the seamless execution of learned skills. On the other hand, Simone Biles exemplifies the power of automatised movements in her successful execution of complex gymnastic routines. Our executive functions are crucial in consciously guiding our thoughts and behaviours. Still, chatter, in the form of negative self-talk and rumination, impairs these functions and divides our attention. This can sabotage performance in various domains and affect our social interactions, as excessive sharing of negative inner thoughts can strain relationships.

Chatter-driven social behaviours, both online and offline, have negative consequences. Overventing and over-voicing chatter can lead to social exclusion, gossip, and even threats of violence. Social media platforms lack the subtle physical cues that trigger empathy, leading to reduced empathy and increased cruelty, such as trolling and cyberbullying. Emotional oversharing on social media can irritate and alienate others, violating social norms and straining relationships. Despite these adverse outcomes, people continue to engage in chatter-driven behaviours on social media due to immediate satisfaction and the activation of reward circuitry in the brain.

Chatter not only affects us emotionally but also has physical implications. Chronic stress, fueled by negative self-talk and repetitive negative thinking, is linked to various health problems, including cardiovascular disease, sleep disorders, and a weakened immune system. Negative self-talk and repetitive negative thinking are standard features of mental illnesses and are considered risk factors. However, there are examples of resilience and overcoming hardships through social connections and healthy coping mechanisms. By understanding and harnessing our inner voice, we can optimise its impact, achieve personal growth, and overcome challenges.

## Zooming Out

Tracey, a student from a tough neighbourhood in West Philadelphia, undergoes a polygraph test with the NSA and worries about the consequences if she fails. She receives a scholarship from the NSA to attend Harvard but faces loneliness, pressure, and a lack of freedom. The author's research team explores the concept of distancing, finding that adopting a fly-on-the-wall perspective can reduce rumination and improve emotional well-being. Distancing techniques have broad applications and can help manage emotions and improve academic performance.

The paradox of Solomon is discussed, highlighting how individuals often lack insight into their own lives compared to how they perceive others. Abraham Lincoln's story exemplifies the importance of gaining distance to reason wisely. Wisdom involves constructive reasoning, recognising the limits of knowledge, considering various perspectives, and reconciling opposing views. The psychological space can enhance decision-making, reduce biases, promote compromise, and reduce political extremism.

Distancing is also beneficial in romantic relationships, with distancers remaining calm and problem-solving during conflicts. Teaching couples to distance themselves during arguments improves relationship satisfaction. Temporal distancing, such as imagining how one will feel about a current experience in the future, helps manage stressors, improve relationships, and increase forgiveness. Journaling serves as a tool for gaining distance and creating positive narratives. Tracey's transformation through family history research and journaling contribute to her relief from anxiety.

The author shares their experience with an intense inner voice during a threatening situation and their journey in finding relief by saying their name.


## When I Become You

The author receives a disturbing letter while sitting at home and contemplates hiring a bodyguard, realising it's an unreasonable idea. They start saying their name in their head to gain perspective and control their emotions. They notice examples of people using self-talk with their names and experiment on distanced self-talk, where participants use their names instead of first-person pronouns. Distanced self-talk effectively reduces negative emotions, improves performance in stressful situations, and promotes rational thinking and wise reasoning.

The concept of shifters in language explains how distanced self-talk works and brain activity measurements show that it produces emotional relief within one second. Distanced self-talk is effortless and does not overtax executive functions. It helps interpret stress as a challenge rather than a threat, as demonstrated in Mr Rogers's letter. Research indicates that distanced self-talk leads to more positive thinking and results, influencing cardiovascular responses from threat to challenge mode.

The Batman Effect, which involves using distanced self-talk in children, promotes perseverance and coping skills. Using universal "you" in language helps normalise experiences and provides psychological distance, allowing for perspective and learning lessons from incidents. Distanced self-talk is a powerful tool for managing chatter, with lasting effects, surpassing the soothing potential of conversations with others.


## The Power and Peril of Other People

Sharing emotions online after a tragedy is often seen as a way to find comfort and normalise experiences. However, studies show that discussing negative emotions with others does not improve outcomes or significantly reduce chatter and improve mental health. The belief that talking about feelings is beneficial has been ingrained in Western culture for centuries, stemming from our early attachment needs and the desire for belonging. Emotional support from others tends to prioritise emotional needs over cognitive demands, which can contribute to co-rumination and the worsening of negative emotions.

Co-rumination occurs when discussing negative experiences leads to increased distress and rumination, activating a chain reaction of related negative thoughts and memories. This is due to the associative nature of memory and the bias towards emotional needs, which explains why talking often fails to alleviate chatter. The solution to co-rumination lies in addressing cognitive needs and reframing the problem. Adequate support combines emotional comfort with cognitive problem-solving, seeking diverse support sources and specialised help.

Various techniques, such as cognitive problem-solving techniques used in therapy, invisible support, affectionate touch, and nonverbal communication, can provide comfort and support during vulnerable times. It's essential to be mindful of the impact of online communication and digital environments on our internal conversations, although research in this area is still emerging. Additionally, our surroundings and domain, including our relationships and activities, play a significant role in shaping our chatter and provide opportunities for improvement.


## Outside In

The Robert Taylor Homes, a large public housing complex in Chicago, aimed to address slum conditions but ended up exacerbating challenges faced by the community. Ming Kuo conducted a study at the Robert Taylor Homes and found that residents living in green-viewed apartments showed better attentional focus and more positive behaviour. Exposure to green spaces in urban areas has been associated with lower distress and higher well-being. Nature can recharge attentional reserves and reduce rumination, as attention restoration theory suggests.

Technologies like the ReTUNE app maximise exposure to restorative nature during daily walks, highlighting the importance of structuring our environments to reduce chatter. Suzanne Bott participated in a research experiment on the Green River, where awe-inspiring rafting trips were designed to help military veterans and first responders connect with nature. The study found that experiencing awe during the trip significantly improved well-being, decreased stress, and reduced levels of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Wonder has also been linked to perceiving time as more available and reducing inflammation.

Creating order in our physical surroundings can reduce anxiety and improve mental well-being. Proactive choices in shaping our environments can increase the benefits we derive from them. The Robert Taylor Homes demonstrate the importance of actively taking control of our surroundings for our use and highlight the interconnectedness between our physical environments and our minds. We can improve our well-being by harnessing our inner voices and utilising the methods available to us.

## Mind Magic

Maria Theresia von Paradis, a blind musical prodigy, regained her vision through treatment with Franz Anton Mesmer, who used animal magnetism. However, scientific investigations by Benjamin Franklin concluded that the healing power was attributed to the mind's expectations rather than animal magnetism. This demonstrated the influence of belief and the placebo effect, where placebos without active medical ingredients can still produce positive results based on suggestion and belief. Placebos have been shown to alleviate symptoms across various conditions and have enduring consequences, highlighting the mind's potential for healing.

Expectations play a crucial role in the placebo effect, as beliefs about the effectiveness of a treatment influence its outcome. Tig Notaro's comedy set discussing her cancer diagnosis exemplifies the role of expectations in shaping our experiences. Our ability to engage in actions relies on predictions and expectations generated by our brains. Placebos work through preconscious automatic responses and conscious thought, shaping our beliefs, expectations, experiences, and well-being. Different neural pathways and systems in the brain are involved in the placebo effect, depending on the specific response being influenced.

Cultural rituals, whether culturally transmitted or personally created, serve as practical tools for managing our inner voices and combating chatter. Rituals can reduce anxiety, improve performance, and provide a sense of control and order. They direct attention away from negative thoughts, enhance social connections, and activate the placebo mechanism. Integrating scientific knowledge of rituals and placebos into our culture is challenging but crucial for spreading this knowledge and utilising these innate chatter-fighting tools.
