## Summary
This revolutionary science book challenges conventional physics by exploring unconventional phenomena including variable light speeds, time machines, morphogenetic fields, and object replication. Through detailed experimental research, the author demonstrates how repeated identical experiments show decreasing effectiveness - a "reaction extinction" principle that applies to everything from chemical reactions to entire civilizations. The book presents practical experiments that suggest the past exists simultaneously with the present, and that similar forms interact across both time and space through quantum-level connections.

Readers interested in frontier science, experimental physics, and alternative theories will discover thought-provoking experiments that challenge established scientific paradigms. The book offers hands-on experimental schemes and theoretical frameworks that could revolutionize our understanding of time, energy, and matter.

## Core Insights

### The Law of Reaction Extinction
Repeated identical processes naturally weaken over time, whether chemical reactions, biological growth, or even civilizations. The first experiment yields maximum results, followed by decline, brief recovery, and then a plateau of low-intensity outcomes. This principle explains why medicines lose effectiveness, why agricultural fields need rest periods, and why stable civilizations inevitably decline.
> "Life itself requires a constant change of directors and scenery"
_Original: "Жизнь сама требует постоянной смены режиссеров и декораций"_
**Quick Take**: Vary your routines, medications, and environments to maintain effectiveness.

### Time as a Physical Substance
The past exists physically in the present moment, creating measurable effects on current experiments. Similar events leave "time traces" that influence subsequent identical occurrences, suggesting time is not linear but a continuous physical medium where all moments coexist.
> "The past is in the present. Or - zero speed of light"
_Original: "Прошлое — в настоящем. Или — нулевая скорость света"_
**Quick Take**: Past experiences physically impact present outcomes in measurable ways.

### Morphogenetic Fields and Form Replication
Similar forms naturally interact and influence each other across space and time. Objects create "form-building fields" that guide the replication of similar structures, explaining how crystals grow more easily after initial successes, how birds learn behaviors simultaneously worldwide, and how biological structures replicate with remarkable precision.
> "The morphogenetic field, from the beginning of time, helps all living things to develop"
_Original: "Морфогенетическое поле, с самого начала времени, помогает всему живому развиваться"_
**Quick Take**: Learning and development are accelerated by similar patterns existing elsewhere.

### Unsupported Movement and Energy Concentration
The book presents experimental evidence for energy concentration in granular media, suggesting that ordered matter naturally collects and upgrades energy quality. Experiments with wet sand electrolysis show asymmetrical energy distribution that contradicts classical electrical laws, indicating new principles of energy transformation.
> "Matter, which is an array of approximately identical granules, has the ability to collect energy"
_Original: "Вещество, являющееся массивом приблизительно одинаковых гранул, способно собирать энергию"_
**Quick Take**: Structured environments naturally concentrate and enhance energy.

### Quantum Teleportation of Objects
Objects can replicate themselves or draw similar objects from the past through quantum-level connections between similar forms. The author suggests that microscopic cavities within biological organisms create conditions for element transmutation and object replication without requiring massive energy input.
> "Objects not only copy themselves in the present. They are able to draw their own similarities from the past"
_Original: "Объекты не только копируют себя в настоящем. Они способны чертить свои сходства из прошлого"_
**Quick Take**: Similar patterns naturally attract and replicate each other across space and time.

  _Original: "Мы можем и должны взять ее методы на службу себе (и человечеству)."_
- "Time, in its entirety… Or even materialize the necessary fragments of it. Modeled after the present. A pleasant bonus is the victory over aging."
  _Original: "Время, в его entirety... Или даже материализовать необходимые фрагменты его. Смоделированные по настоящему. Приятный бонус — победа над старением."_

## Action Items
- **Vary your routines**: Change location, timing, or methods when repeated actions lose effectiveness
- **Observe reaction patterns**: Notice how repeated identical behaviors or processes produce diminishing returns
- **Experiment with form replication**: Test if similar objects placed near each other influence outcomes
- **Study energy concentration**: Research granular media and structured energy systems
- **Explore morphogenetic connections**: Document simultaneous learning patterns in groups or similar systems

## Questions to Consider
- What happens when we perform identical experiments in different locations - are the results truly independent?
- Could medicinal effectiveness be restored by changing administration methods or environments rather than increasing dosages?
- How might ancient monuments or massive structures serve as "time beacons" that influence current events?
- If the past physically exists in the present, how might we access and utilize this temporal information?
- What role do microscopic cavities play in biological transmutation and energy concentration?

## Conclusion
This book is worth your time if you're fascinated by frontier science that challenges established paradigms. While some theories remain speculative, the experimental evidence presented for reaction extinction, morphogenetic fields, and energy concentration is compelling and reproducible. The biggest reason to read it is the practical experimental schemes that allow readers to verify these unconventional phenomena themselves. Whether you accept all conclusions or not, this book will fundamentally change how you think about time, energy, and the interconnected nature of physical reality. The author's hands-on approach and detailed experimental documentation make this an invaluable resource for anyone interested in exploring the boundaries of conventional science.
