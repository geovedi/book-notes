## The Golden Elephant

"The Golden Elephant" is a story set in Mumbai that introduces a deep-learning-enabled insurance program and explores the strengths and weaknesses of AI. The story follows Nayana, a teenage girl whose family is enrolled in the program. The AI program uses apps to improve the insured's lives, but its persuasive nudges complicate Nayana's search for love. The story highlights the risks of companies possessing extensive user data and the potential detrimental effects of AI's single-minded pursuit of certain goals. The story is followed by commentary from Kai-Fu, discussing the history of AI and the reasons for excitement and distrust towards it. The story delves into societal issues like the caste system, discrimination, privacy concerns, and the impact of AI on personal relationships. It concludes with Nayana challenging societal expectations and defying the warnings from the AI, seeking answers in the ancient streets of Mumbai.

The story emphasizes the benefits and limitations of deep learning, which is a breakthrough in AI. Deep learning uses artificial neural networks with multiple layers and requires large amounts of data and computing power for training. Once trained, it outperforms humans in specific tasks and can customize experiences for individual users. However, deep learning has limitations and relies on sufficient data, a narrow domain, and a concrete objective function to optimize. It's important to recognize that deep learning works differently from the human brain and lacks certain human abilities like drawing on experience and common sense.

The first beneficiaries of deep learning are Internet companies and the finance industry due to their access to vast amounts of data and clear business metrics. Internet companies use deep learning to personalize recommendations and maximize revenue, while AI-based fintech companies in finance offer instant transactions, lower costs, and better financial results. Deep learning's ability to utilize heterogeneous data beyond human assessment improves risk assessments in finance.

However, deep learning also has downsides. AI's extensive knowledge of users can lead to manipulation and addiction, as seen in the story. The simplicity of the objective function in AI optimization can cause harmful externalities and actions that exacerbate inequality. Addressing these issues requires complex objective functions, involving humans in defining metrics like "time well spent" and "fairness." Fairness and bias concerns arise when AI decisions are based on biased or insufficiently represented data. Steps to address fairness and bias include disclosure, ethical training for AI engineers, rigorous testing, and AI audits.

Deep learning's decision-making process is complex and difficult to explain fully to humans, raising concerns about explanation and justification. Efforts are underway to make AI more transparent and interpretable. Public distrust of AI is significant, but historical examples show that technology and policy solutions can address the challenges it presents over time.

## Gods Behind the Masks

In "Gods Behind the Masks," the story revolves around Amaka, a skilled video producer who is recruited to create deepfake videos for a group called Igbo Glory. Deepfakes are fake videos or images created using generative adversarial networks (GANs). Amaka's mission is to undermine the influence of an avatar named FAKA by creating convincing deepfake videos. However, as he delves deeper into his task, Amaka begins to question his actions and the implications of his work. The story explores the ethical dilemmas surrounding deepfakes, the manipulation of public opinion, and the complexities of ethnic tensions in Nigeria.

Deepfakes have become a significant concern in computer vision due to their potential for deception and misuse. They are created using GANs, which consist of a generator network and a discriminator network. The generator produces realistic-looking fake content, while the discriminator tries to differentiate between real and fake content. Through iterative training, GANs create increasingly convincing deepfakes.

Detecting deepfakes is an ongoing challenge, as the technology evolves and becomes more sophisticated. Techniques for detecting deepfakes focus on identifying inconsistencies or artifacts in the generated content. However, as deepfake-making tools advance, detection methods must keep pace.

The story highlights the need for robust anti-fake detection systems and the importance of legislation and regulations to address the challenges posed by deepfakes. While deepfakes can have negative implications, computer vision itself has numerous beneficial applications in various fields.

As technology continues to advance, striking a balance between leveraging the potential of computer vision and addressing its risks becomes increasingly crucial. Ongoing research, robust detection methods, and responsible use of AI technologies are necessary to mitigate the negative consequences associated with deepfakes and ensure the ethical development of computer vision applications.
