# Connect the Dots
**Original Title**: Połącz kropki
**Author**: Łukasz Lamża | **Year**: 2021

## Summary

This book offers a grounded, journalist's perspective on emerging technologies, rejecting the grand narratives and far-fetched predictions common in futurist literature. Lamża, a science journalist who regularly reads scientific publications, provides a realistic assessment of where technology actually stands in 2021. He structures the book around five major technological visions that recur in popular culture and media, examining both the foundational technologies (IDEA) and their current state of development (JEST).

The book serves as a "future technology textbook" with 59 "frames" spread throughout that explain the basics of key technologies like machine learning, cellular agriculture, CRISPR genome editing, 3D printing, brain imaging, and more. Lamża aims to infect readers with his enthusiasm for real technological achievements while cutting through the hype that surrounds many futuristic predictions. He believes what we have available today is "wonderful, amazing, beautiful, terrifying, and fascinating."

The book is ideal for readers tired of science fiction predictions who want to understand what technology is actually capable of right now. It's perfect for those who appreciate concrete achievements over abstract possibilities and want a realistic foundation for understanding technological progress.

## Core Insights

### Beyond Grand Narratives: Real Technology vs. Futurist Fantasies

Lamża rejects the "great narratives" of futurology that dominate books like Kurzweil's "The Singularity Is Near," Harari's "Homo Deus," or Tegmark's "Life 3.0." While these visionaries skip over "technical details" assuming what can be imagined can be written about, Lamża argues these details are decisive for understanding what's possible versus what isn't. He's particularly critical of the perpetually "ten years away" predictions about Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) that have been made since the 1970s.

> "It's no art to predict the future. The art is to predict correctly."
> _Original: "Nie jest żadną sztuką przepowiadać przyszłość. Sztuką jest przepowiadać trafnie"._

**Quick Take**: Technology progress is best understood through concrete achievements rather than bold predictions, and the gap between vision and reality often lies in seemingly boring technical details.

### Five Technological Visions Structuring Our Future

The book is organized around five major technological dreams that shape both research and popular imagination: I. Your Robot (autonomous robot assistants), II. Your World (personalized content and products), III. Your Data (comprehensive data collection and analysis), IV. Your Body (health and longevity through advanced medicine), and V. Your Mind (brain-computer integration). Each section provides both the underlying science and current real-world examples.

> _Original: "Plan jest taki, że ja dostarczam kropki, ale to wy bawicie się w ich łączenie."_

**Quick Take**: The five visions serve as a framework for understanding how different technologies interconnect and build upon each other, allowing readers to form their own picture of the future.

### The Demographic Imperative for Robotics

One of Lamża's most compelling arguments for robot development comes from demographic reality. The 21st century will be "the era of the elderly" – in 1950, people over 70 constituted 3% of the global population; today it's 6%; by 2050 it will exceed 11%. In Poland, it's already 12.3% and will reach 23% by 2050. In Japan, it will be 31% – nearly one in three people.

> _Original: "XXI wiek będzie epoką staruszków."_

**Quick Take**: Robotic assistants aren't just billionaire fantasies but may become necessities due to aging populations and declining birth rates in developed countries.

### The Pareidolia Effect: Why We Want Human-like Robots

Research shows humans respond much better to humanoid machines, and even simple "humanizing" tricks like eye contact, blinking, or using someone's name dramatically increase sympathy. This relates to pareidolia – our tendency to see human faces in clouds or tree bark. Our "human-seeking circuit" is extremely sensitive, making us want to give machines personality and humanity even against what our eyes and reason tell us.

In a fascinating experiment with the Nao robot as a fitness coach for elderly people, simple functions like automatic head tracking, eye blinking, and using participants' names made the robot come alive in their eyes, despite its limited conversational abilities.

**Quick Take**: Successful human-robot interaction may depend more on psychological tricks than sophisticated AI, as humans are predisposed to see humanity in machines.

### The Reality Check: Appreciating Present Achievements

Lamża expresses frustration with both fantasists who don't understand the technologies they predict and "blazed complainers" who aren't impressed by real technological achievements because they don't meet abstract standards of greatness. Despite algorithms being able to generate photorealistic faces of non-existent people, create images on demand, conduct political debates, write short stories and articles, compose film music, and beat humans at most computer games, someone will always remind us that it's not "real" AI.

> _Original: "To, co mamy do dyspozycji już dzisiaj, teraz, w 2021 roku, jest wspaniałe, niesamowite, piękne, przerażające i fascynujące, a jeżeli ktoś uważa przeciwnie, to się nie zna i niech spada na drzewo."_

**Quick Take**: Current technological capabilities are already remarkable and deserve appreciation on their own terms, rather than being dismissed for not meeting impossible futuristic expectations.

## Action Items

- **Practice Critical Tech Evaluation**: Learn to distinguish between genuine technological capabilities and marketing hype by focusing on specific, verifiable achievements rather than vague promises.

- **Understand Demographic Impacts**: Consider how aging populations in developed countries will create genuine needs for technological solutions, particularly in healthcare and assistance.

- **Appreciate Incremental Progress**: Recognize that real technological advancement often comes through small, practical improvements rather than dramatic breakthroughs.

- **Watch the "Frames"**: Pay attention to the foundational technologies (machine learning, CRISPR, 3D printing, etc.) that enable multiple applications across different fields.

## Questions to Consider

1. How can we maintain excitement about real technological progress without falling into either sci-fi fantasy or cynical dismissal?

2. What role should demographic imperatives play in prioritizing certain technological developments over others?

3. How do our psychological tendencies to humanize machines affect both the development and acceptance of robotics?

4. What is the right balance between acknowledging current limitations while appreciating present achievements?

5. How can individuals better educate themselves about the technical details that separate possible futures from impossible ones?

## Conclusion

This book is absolutely worth your time if you're tired of either breathless futurist predictions or cynical tech criticism. Lamża provides a refreshingly grounded perspective that celebrates genuine achievements while maintaining realistic expectations. The book's biggest strength is its journalistic approach – it's rooted in actual scientific publications and real-world examples rather than speculative visions.

The title perfectly captures the book's approach: Lamża provides the dots (current technologies and their capabilities) but leaves it to readers to connect them into their own vision of the future. This empowers readers to think critically about technological progress rather than accepting predetermined narratives.

What makes this book particularly valuable is its dual function as both a snapshot of technology in 2021 and a reference guide that will remain useful for understanding foundational technologies even as they advance. The 59 "frames" explaining core concepts ensure it will serve as a "future technology textbook" for years to come.

In a media landscape saturated with both utopian and dystopian predictions about technology, "Connect the Dots" offers something rare: realistic enthusiasm. It reminds us that what we already have is indeed wonderful, amazing, beautiful, terrifying, and fascinating – and that's more than enough reason to pay attention.
