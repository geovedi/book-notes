## Physical Earth
- Introduction to Earth's Dynamic Surface:
  - Earth's surface features, such as mountains, oceans, and continents, are constantly changing due to dynamic geological processes.
  - Geological features like the Rockies, Alps, and coastal plains contrast with vast prairies and steppes.
  - Earth's surface is ever-changing, influenced by geography, topography, and climate.
- Historical Perspective on Earth's Static View:
  - Early human perception saw Earth's physical features as permanent and unchanging.
  - The shift in perspective began with observations of geological changes, like shark teeth found in hillsides, challenging the notion of Earth's static nature.
  - James Hutton's observations of erosion and uplift hinted at Earth's dynamic nature.
- Emergence of Plate Tectonics:
  - Alfred Wegener's hypothesis of continental drift proposed that continents move over time.
  - Evidence from fossil distribution supported the idea of past continental connections.
  - Discovery of mid-ocean ridges and mapping of the ocean floor led to the concept of plate tectonics.
  - Plate tectonics explains the movement of continents, ocean basins, mountains, and earthquakes.
- Plate Tectonic Processes:
  - Plate tectonics involves the movement of rigid lithospheric plates on the Earth's surface.
  - Oceanic crust forms at mid-ocean ridges and is destroyed at subduction zones.
  - Earth's surface features are shaped by interactions between divergent, convergent, and transform plate boundaries.
  - Subduction zones cause volcanic activity, earthquakes, and the recycling of crustal material.
- Supercontinent Cycles:
  - The Wilson Cycle describes the assembly, breakup, and reassembly of supercontinents.
  - Continents have repeatedly aggregated into supercontinents and then dispersed over billions of years.
- Challenges in Reconstructing Early Earth:
  - Limited evidence exists for Earth's early tectonic history due to the scarcity of rocks older than three billion years.
  - The debate centers on whether plate tectonics existed in Earth's early stages.
  - Early Earth had higher temperatures and weaker, thicker lithosphere.
- Hypotheses for Early Plate Tectonics:
  - Some hypotheses propose that early Earth experienced a form of plate tectonics driven by magma pushing apart primordial crust.
  - Other theories suggest that early granites formed from volcanic plumes, challenging conventional subduction-based granite formation.
- Evidence for Early Plate Tectonics:
  - Ancient zircons suggest that Earth's surface materials entered the interior over four billion years ago.
  - Rock magnetism indicates the lateral movement of ancient terrains, supporting early initiation of plate tectonics.
- Complexity of Early Plate Tectonics:
  - Plate tectonics might have started regionally, with episodic movement and coexisting stagnant lids.
  - Weak plates in early Earth could break easily, causing subduction to stall.
- The Impact of Plate Tectonics:
  - By three billion years ago, some form of plate tectonics likely shaped Earth's surface.
  - Plate tectonics initiated the processes that led to Earth's current environment.
  - Earth's ability to sustain life is a consequence of its dynamic surface and plate tectonics.

  - Life's building blocks are proteins, DNA, RNA, and lipids.
  - Amino acids form proteins, and nucleotides form DNA and RNA.
  - Experiments show amino acids and nucleotides can be synthesized under plausible early Earth conditions.
- RNA World Hypothesis:
  - RNA molecules could have played a significant role in the origin of life.
  - RNA's potential for storing information, acting as enzymes, and evolving supports the RNA World hypothesis.
  - RNA molecules might have been the earliest entities that could grow, reproduce, and evolve.
- Geological Evidence of Early Life:
  - Ancient rocks contain signatures of microbial life, including microfossils, stromatolites, and biomarker molecules.
  - Microbial life is evident in rocks as old as 3.5 to 3.3 billion years.
  - Isotopic evidence shows that Earth's early environment supported microbial carbon and sulfur cycling.
- Conditions for Early Life:
  - Early Earth was warm due to greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide, even with a less luminous Sun.
  - An atmosphere of nitrogen, carbon dioxide, and trace amounts of other gases characterized the early Earth.
  - The absence of oxygen in the early atmosphere was conducive to prebiotic chemical reactions.
- The Geologic Timescale:
  - Geologists established the geologic timescale based on relative rock relationships and fossil evidence.
