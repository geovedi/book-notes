## Summary

"Project Manager Productivity Hacks" is a practical guide that delivers 22 proven strategies for reclaiming your time and focus in an increasingly distracted world. Written by experienced project manager Nigel Creaser, this book addresses the modern challenges of digital overload, constant interruptions, and the expectation of immediate availability that plague today's professionals. The author's philosophy is simple: productivity isn't about perfection or becoming a "superhero multitasker" but about implementing small, sustainable changes that compound over time.

This book is perfect for overwhelmed project managers, team leaders, and knowledge workers who feel like they're constantly reacting rather than leading. Readers will learn how to regain control of their attention, streamline communication processes, and create boundaries that protect both their productivity and mental well-being.

## Core Insights

### Turn Off All Notifications
The single most impactful change you can make is eliminating all non-essential notifications. Research shows that interruptions cost 23 minutes of focused time to recover from, and modern professionals face hundreds of daily distractions from email, messaging apps, social media, and collaboration tools. Each notification represents someone else's priorities hijacking your own. Creaser advocates turning off everything except critical alerts for specific VIPs or life-and-death scenarios.

> "ANYONE can send you an email. ANYONE can send you a text if they have your phone number. ANYONE can send you a Slack message if you are in that group. The thing is, they don't know what you're doing at that point in time."

**Quick Take**: You're the CEO of your attention. Stop letting random people dictate your focus throughout the day.

### Schedule Email Processing Instead of Constant Checking
Email has evolved from a useful tool to a constant source of interruption and anxiety. Creaser's revolutionary approach involves processing email just three times daily for 30 minutes each session, using the 4Ds method: Delete, Delegate, Diarise, or Do it. This creates necessary constraints that force better decision-making and prevents email from consuming your entire day. The author acknowledges this feels uncomfortable initially but compares it to building any new habit—uncomfortable at first, then natural with practice.

> "What I really become is a common or garden unfocused procrastinator. By dealing with that email that has just popped in after checking my inbox ten times in the last twenty minutes I feel 'busy'."

**Quick Take**: Email addiction feels productive but it's just sophisticated procrastination. Schedule it, contain it, and reclaim your day.

### Automate Email Management with Rules
Stop manually sorting email—let technology do the work for you. Creaser's game-changing rule moves all CC'd emails to a separate folder, dramatically reducing inbox clutter. Since CC'd emails are typically for awareness rather than action, this immediately separates what needs your attention from what doesn't. He shares additional automation strategies for priority emails, client communications, and systematic filing that work invisibly in the background.

> "Those really, really full email inboxes can be a significant cause for anxiety, stress, inefficiency and ineffectiveness. Just working out which emails you need to deal with is an uphill struggle."

**Quick Take**: Your email should work for you, not the other way around. Automated rules turn your inbox from a burden into a tool.

### Prioritize Physical Health and Ergonomics
Productivity isn't just about time management—it's about sustainable performance. Creaser emphasizes that physical discomfort and poor ergonomics silently destroy focus and energy. This includes proper desk setup, regular breaks, movement, and establishing physical boundaries between work and personal life. The book provides practical advice for workstation optimization and the importance of treating your body as your most valuable productivity asset.

> "If you're like me, you hold yourself to different standards than others. My expectation of others was the opposite, I encouraged them to take these breaks. So why was I holding myself to a different standard?"

**Quick Take**: You can't outsource physical wellbeing. Productivity is a marathon, not a sprint, and your body determines your finish time.

### Strategic Delegation as Productivity Multiplier
True productivity isn't about doing more yourself—it's about maximizing team output through effective delegation. Creaser challenges managers to view delegation not as dumping work but as developing team members while focusing your own time on high-value activities. He provides frameworks for choosing what to delegate based on team development opportunities and organizational resource optimization.

> "Our role as a manager is to maximise the utilisation of company resources as well as delivering on our commitments. What we sometimes miss is that we are one of those resources that we should maximise."

**Quick Take**: Your most limited resource is your own attention. Multiply your impact by developing others through strategic delegation.

The biggest reason to read it is that Creaser understands the real-world challenges of implementing productivity changes—he admits to regularly falling off the wagon himself and provides practical recovery strategies. The book's strength lies in its emphasis on gradual, sustainable improvement rather than overwhelming transformation.

What makes this guide particularly valuable is its focus on the psychology behind why we struggle with productivity habits and its realistic approach to implementation. Creaser doesn't promise magical solutions but provides battle-tested strategies that acknowledge human nature and organizational realities. For project managers and knowledge workers feeling overwhelmed by the demands of modern connectivity, this book offers a clear path to reclaiming control over their most precious resource: their attention.

The actionable advice is worth implementing immediately, with some changes showing benefits within days rather than weeks. In a world where everyone is increasingly distracted, the professionals who master their attention will have an unfair advantage. This book shows you exactly how to build that advantage.
