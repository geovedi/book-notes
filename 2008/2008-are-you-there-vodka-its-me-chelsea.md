## Core Stories

### **The Goldie Hawn Lie**
Handler recounts inventing a movie role as Goldie Hawn's daughter to escape school bullying—only to have the lie spiral out of control when classmates believe it. The story culminates in her father's humiliating intervention and the revelation that sometimes the most ridiculous lies contain their own truth.

> "I had forgotten my language arts homework, and when the teacher singled me out in front of the entire class to find out where it was, I told her that I had been in three straight nights of meetings with Goldie Hawn and Kurt Russell, negotiating my contract."

**Quick Take**: Childhood desperation leads to elaborate lies, but even fabrications reveal our deepest desires for acceptance.

### **The DUI Chronicles**
A harrowing yet hilarious account of getting arrested for drunk driving, complete with failed attempts to bribe the officer, mandatory DUI school, and the ironic realization that her punishment actually improved her social life.

> "Are you there, vodka? It's me, Chelsea. Please get me out of jail and I promise I will never drink again. Drink and drive. I will never drink and drive again."

**Quick Take**: Rock bottom moments make the best stories, but maybe call an Uber next time.

### **Family Dysfunction**
Handler paints her family as a cast of characters: her well-meaning but clueless father who sells junk cars and drops her off in a yellow Yugo, her perpetually disorganized mother, and four brothers who taught her the fine art of self-defense.

> "My father had no idea of or interest in how damaging his 1967 Yugo had been to my social status."

**Quick Take**: Family dysfunction is universal—what matters is whether you can laugh about it later.

### **Dating Disasters**
From midgets to clowns, Handler's dating adventures read like a comedy writer's fever dream. Each relationship disaster serves as cautionary tale about attraction, desperation, and knowing when to walk away.

**Quick Take**: Bad dates make great stories, terrible relationships, and excellent material for comedy specials.
