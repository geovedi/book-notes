# The Big Necessity
**Author**: Rose George | **Year**: 2008

## Summary
"The Big Necessity" reveals how the taboo topic of human waste management is one of the most critical public health and human rights issues facing our world today. George takes readers on a global journey from London's Victorian sewers to China's biogas revolution, from India's caste-based scavenging to innovative sanitation solutions that could save millions of lives. The book exposes a shocking paradox: while 2.6 billion people lack access to basic sanitation, the developed world remains oblivious to its own fragile sewage systems. This is essential reading for anyone interested in global health, environmental sustainability, or human rights, offering eye-opening perspectives on how something we all do daily has become a silent crisis affecting billions.

## Core Insights

### The Global Sanitation Crisis
Four out of ten people worldwide have no access to any toilet, latrine, or sanitation facility. They defecate in open spaces, plastic bags, or dangerous areas, with women risking rape and snakebites by seeking pre-dawn privacy. The consequences are devastating: a gram of feces can contain 10 million viruses, 1 million bacteria, 1,000 parasite cysts, and 100 worm eggs. Poor sanitation causes one in ten of the world's illnesses, with diarrhea killing a child every fifteen seconds—more deaths than armed conflict since World War II.

> "The toilet is the barometer of civilization. How a society disposes of its human excrement is an indication of how it treats its humans, too."

**Quick Take**: Sanitation isn't just about comfort—it's about human dignity, public health, and survival. The lack of toilets affects education, economic development, and gender equality worldwide.

### Sanitation as the Greatest Medical Advance
In 2007, British Medical Journal readers voted sanitation as the biggest medical milestone of the last 200 years, surpassing antibiotics and anesthesia. In 19th century London, one in two children died early until proper sewage systems reduced child mortality by a fifth—the largest reduction in British history. Modern sanitation has added twenty years to the average human lifespan, making the toilet the single biggest variable in increasing human longevity.

> "Diarrhea—nearly 90 percent of which is caused by fecally contaminated food or water—kills a child every fifteen seconds."

**Quick Take**: Toilets and proper waste disposal save more lives than most medical interventions. This simple technology prevents disease at its source rather than treating symptoms later.

### The Myth of Western Superiority
The Western world's sewage infrastructure is far more fragile than most citizens realize. In 2007, Galway, Ireland—a wealthy European cultural center—lived with contaminated drinking water for five months due to cryptosporidium from sewage treatment failures. Milwaukee's 1993 cryptosporidium outbreak made 400,000 people sick and killed over 100. Ninety percent of the world's sewage ends up untreated in oceans, rivers, and lakes, much of it from supposedly "sanitary" developed cities.

> "Despite the technology, the engineers and the ingenuity of modern sanitary systems, even the richest, best-equipped humans still don't know what to do with sewage except move it somewhere else and hope no one notices."

**Quick Take**: Modern sanitation systems are not permanent solutions but ongoing challenges that require maintenance, investment, and vigilance—luxuries many cities can't afford.

### The Power of Taboo and Language
The book explores how defecation has moved from a public activity to one of our strongest taboos. Unlike other body functions, there's no neutral, conversational word for what we produce daily. This linguistic barrier makes addressing sanitation problems incredibly difficult. The people who solve sanitation issues most effectively are those willing to speak frankly about the reality of human waste.

> "Just as HIV/AIDS cannot be discussed without talking frankly about sex, so the problem of sanitation cannot be discussed without talking frankly about shit." - Umesh Panday, Nepali sanitation activist

**Quick Take**: Breaking the silence around sanitation is crucial for progress. When we can't name the problem, we can't solve it effectively.

### India's Sulabh Revolution
Dr. Bindeshwar Pathak's Sulabh International has revolutionized sanitation in India by making it a business rather than charity. Rejecting international grants, Sulabh created pay-per-use public toilets that fund themselves while providing employment for former scavengers (caste-based waste handlers). The organization has built over 1.2 million household toilets and 7,500 public toilet complexes, serving 15 million people daily while freeing thousands from degrading manual labor.

> "Technology for the poor should not be poor technology." - Joe Madiath, Gram Vikas

**Quick Take**: Sustainable sanitation solutions must be economically viable and socially appropriate, not just technologically advanced. Successful models create local ownership and maintenance capacity.

### China's Biogas Innovation
China leads the world in converting human excrement into energy through biogas digesters. For decades, the Chinese government has promoted household systems that turn waste into cooking gas and fertilizer. The Shaanxi Mothers organization won international recognition for installing these systems in rural areas, providing both energy and agricultural benefits while safely processing human waste.

> "Along with all the other stunning statistics China can provide, it can also claim to be the world leader in making energy from human excrement."

**Quick Take**: Human waste isn't just waste—it's a valuable resource that can provide energy, fertilizer, and economic opportunities when properly managed through ecological sanitation approaches.

### The World Toilet Organization
Jack Sim's World Toilet Organization has brought dignity and humor to sanitation advocacy through international conferences, training programs, and awareness campaigns. Their approach uses humor to break taboos while presenting shocking facts that demand attention. By treating toilet access as a human right rather than luxury, they've helped elevate global awareness and create professional networks of sanitation advocates.

> "If the world can talk about eating food (he calls this 'uploading'), then isn't it time they talked about downloading, too?"

**Quick Take**: Creative approaches that combine humor with serious advocacy can break through cultural barriers and bring attention to neglected public health issues.

- How does our access to sanitation privilege shape our understanding of global health and development?
- What would happen if Western cities experienced the same sanitation failures as developing nations?
- How can we reframe waste as a resource rather than something to be hidden and disposed of?
- What role should governments play in ensuring universal sanitation access versus private sector solutions?

## Conclusion

"The Big Necessity" is a vital, disturbing, and ultimately hopeful book that reveals how one of humanity's most basic needs has become a global crisis. George's investigation exposes the shocking reality that 2.6 billion people live without toilets while the developed world takes sanitation for granted—often with fragile infrastructure that could fail at any moment.

What makes this book essential reading is its ability to connect individual bodily functions to global systems of health, environment, economics, and human dignity. The greatest strength of "The Big Necessity" lies not just in exposing problems but in showcasing innovative solutions—from China's biogas digesters to India's Sulabh public toilet revolution—that prove sanitation challenges can be solved with appropriate technology, community involvement, and political will.

This book is absolutely worth your time if you care about global health, environmental sustainability, or human rights. It will fundamentally change how you think about something you do every day, likely making you grateful for facilities you've never noticed while inspiring you to help ensure this basic human right extends to everyone, everywhere. The most compelling reason to read this book is simple: understanding sanitation is understanding the foundation of public health and human dignity—something no one should take for granted.
