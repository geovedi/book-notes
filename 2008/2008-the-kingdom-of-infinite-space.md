# The Kingdom of Infinite Space
**Authors**: Raymond Tallis | **Year**: 2008
**Category**: Philosophy & Critical Thinking

## Summary
"The Kingdom of Infinite Space" is a philosophical exploration of the human head that challenges both religious and scientistic approaches to understanding consciousness. Tallis, a physician-philosopher, examines the head not just as a biological organ but as the site of our most profound human experiences—from the mundane secretion of saliva to the transcendent nature of human thought and consciousness. The book argues against the reduction of human consciousness to merely neural activity, presenting instead a humanistic view that celebrates the mystery and complexity of embodied consciousness.

Readers interested in philosophy of mind, consciousness studies, and the relationship between body and self will discover a refreshingly accessible yet profound meditation on what it means to be human. Tallis combines scientific knowledge with philosophical insight to reveal the extraordinary significance of everyday bodily functions we rarely consider.

## Core Insights

### Beyond Brain-Centered Understanding
Tallis argues powerfully against the prevailing "neuromythology" that reduces all human consciousness to brain activity. He contends that while the brain is necessary for consciousness, it is not sufficient—humans require bodies, environments, and societies to fully exist as conscious beings. The head, for Tallis, represents a corrective to "headless brains" that dominate contemporary neuroscience discourse.

> "At any rate, if this book is about a largely brainless head, it is a corrective to the headless brains that fill the newspapers, bookshelves and the airwaves."

**Quick Take**: Consciousness cannot be reduced to neural activity alone; it emerges from the complex interplay between brain, body, environment, and society.

### The Peculiar Relationship With Our Own Heads
The book explores the paradoxical relationship we have with our own heads—we simultaneously are our heads, own them, suffer them, use them as tools, and judge them. This complex relationship reveals the unique human condition of being conscious, self-conscious agents in organic bodies.

> "My head and I' is a more problematic marriage than anything that August Strindberg or Edward Albee could have dreamed up."

**Quick Take**: Our relationship with our own heads exemplifies the fundamental human tension between being embodied beings and transcending our physical nature.

### The Philosophy of Secretions
Through fascinating examinations of saliva, tears, mucus, and other bodily secretions, Tallis demonstrates how biological functions are transformed into uniquely human experiences. From the social evolution of spitting etiquette to the uniquely human emotional crying, these mundane functions reveal deep insights into human nature.

> "We could almost define the arc of life as beginning and ending with drooling; or our presenile maturity as those years when we successfully police the liquid contents of our mouth."

**Quick Take**: Even the most basic biological functions reveal profound truths about human consciousness, culture, and our relationship with our bodies.

### Human Achievement and Transcendence
Despite being made of "crooked timber," humans have achieved extraordinary cultural and intellectual accomplishments. Tallis celebrates human capacity for self-transcendence—the ability to lift ourselves above our biological limitations through collective consciousness, culture, and shared knowledge.

> "Out of the crooked timber of humanity, no straight thing was ever made' the German philosopher Immanuel Kant famously said. Given the material out of which we are made and self-made, it is amazing just how straight we are at times."

**Quick Take**: Human beings demonstrate remarkable capacity for transcending their biological limitations through collective intelligence, culture, and conscious evolution.

## Best Quotes

> "Many writers, following the example of Plato, have seen the body as a kind of prison, a cognitive disaster, a humiliation, or some kind of moral disgrace. I, on the other hand, while I do not believe that we are immortal souls, unhappy lodgers accidentally trapped in 70 kilograms of protoplasm, equally reject the notion that we are entirely identified with our bodies. The standpoint of this book is neither religious nor scientistic, but humanistic."

> "Spitting on someone is the ultimate in insult, compared with which name-calling, however inflammatory and degrading, seems merely metaphorical. Spittle originates from the cavity where words are factored, so that spitting partakes of linguistic signs."

> "The human world, the human condition, is often described as 'a vale of tears', never as 'a vale of mucus' or 'a sea of saliva' or 'a midden of earwax'."

> "Whatever the status of our saliva in our mouth, the spit in the tumbler has, as Broks puts it, 'renounced its citizenship'."

## Key Takeaways

- **Resist Reductionism**: Don't let neuroscience completely determine your understanding of consciousness and human nature
- **Appreciate Embodiment**: Recognize the profound significance of your physical body and its everyday functions
- **Embrace Mystery**: Accept that some aspects of consciousness may never be fully explained by scientific reductionism
- **Value Human Achievement**: Appreciate the extraordinary cultural and intellectual accomplishments humans have achieved despite biological limitations
- **Question Assumptions**: Challenge both religious and scientistic dogmas about what it means to be human

## Questions to Consider

- If consciousness cannot be reduced to brain activity, what is the relationship between mind and body?
- How do everyday bodily functions like crying or spitting reveal deeper truths about human nature?
- Can we truly understand consciousness through scientific methods alone, or do we need philosophical and humanistic approaches?
- What does it mean to be both embodied beings capable of transcending our physical nature?
- How does our relationship with our own heads reflect broader questions about human identity and consciousness?

## Conclusion
"The Kingdom of Infinite Space" is well worth your time if you're interested in consciousness studies, philosophy of mind, or simply want to better understand what it means to be human. Tallis offers a refreshing alternative to both religious dualism and scientific reductionism, presenting instead a deeply humanistic celebration of embodied consciousness.

The book's greatest strength lies in its ability to find profound meaning in everyday bodily functions while maintaining philosophical rigor and accessibility. Tallis reminds us that the mystery of human consciousness is something to be celebrated rather than solved, and that our achievements as a species are remarkable given our biological limitations. This book will leave you with a newfound appreciation for your own head and the extraordinary kingdom it represents.
