**Authors**: Andrew Mawson | **Year**: 2008
**Category**: Business & Finance

## Summary
"The Social Entrepreneur" is Andrew Mawson's firsthand account of transforming one of London's most deprived areas through entrepreneurial thinking applied to social problems. Arriving in Bromley-by-Bow in 1984 as a young clergyman, Mawson discovered that traditional approaches to poverty alleviation weren't working. Over the next two decades, he pioneered the application of business principles to social issues, ultimately founding the renowned Bromley-by-Bow Centre.

This book is essential reading for anyone frustrated with bureaucratic approaches to social change. It offers a powerful alternative vision for tackling entrenched social problems through relationship-building, practical action, and long-term commitment. Readers will discover how to turn passion into practice and why "learning by doing" beats policy papers every time.

## Core Insights

### Inside-Out Approach: Start with People, Not Policy
Mawson argues that effective social change must begin with human relationships rather than theoretical frameworks. While governments start with committees and research papers, social entrepreneurs start with the "inner dynamics of a very human situation." His approach was to wander the streets, meet local people like Lillian (the church caretaker) and Ethel (the 73-year-old with "seventeen-year-old spirit"), and understand the community from the ground up.

> "Social entrepreneurs worth their salt do not follow conventional ways of working. Their view of the world begins with people, passion, experience and story – not policy, statistics and theory."

**Quick Take**: Before launching any social initiative, spend months understanding the human relationships and daily dynamics of the community you want to serve.

### Learning by Doing: The Entrepreneurial Method
The core philosophy of the social entrepreneur is direct, practical engagement rather than theoretical planning. Mawson illustrates this with the example of his son learning to complete a jigsaw puzzle through trial and error, contrasting it with how government would handle the situation: "They would spend a long time examining the pieces before writing an extensive and expensive report on their findings."

> "The 'learning by doing' approach is the tried and tested approach of the social entrepreneur. We call into question the systems and processes of government, which are still run by well-qualified civil servants who rarely get hold of the pieces themselves and whose approach has so failed many of our poorest communities."

**Quick Take**: Take immediate, small-scale action to test ideas rather than waiting for perfect plans or funding.

### Building Bridges Through Shared Purpose
One of the most powerful examples in the book is how Mawson brought together different generations by allowing Su (a young boat-builder) to use the church hall. Initially, the elderly church members were hesitant, but Ethel's wisdom ("Noah built a boat and so why shouldn't Su?") opened the door. As Su built her boat, relationships formed naturally: Ethel and Su discovered mutual respect, and the community began to heal its generational divides.

> "Two completely different generations now inhabited the same space – my church hall – even though to date they had never actually met or spoken to each other. Together, we had all unwittingly made a small step forward."
> _Original: Same as above_
**Quick Take**: Create physical spaces and shared activities that naturally bring diverse groups together.

### Long-Term Commitment Trumps Quick Fixes
Mawson emphasizes that real social change requires decades, not years, of commitment. He contrasts this with government programs that cycle through every few years. The Victorian entrepreneurs he admires, like John Harrison (who spent his life perfecting the marine chronometer) and Samuel Lister (who revolutionized the wool industry while working under his machinery), understood that meaningful change requires sustained dedication.

> "I believe that when it comes to some of our most intractable social problems, it is time once again to identify, understand, support and reward people who take the long view and who focus on the practical details of a particular situation and place."
> _Original: Same as above_
**Quick Take**: Commit to staying in one place long enough to see real transformation – think in decades, not election cycles.

### Business Logic Applied to Social Problems
Social entrepreneurs apply business thinking to social challenges without being driven solely by profit. They understand that "if you don't sell your products, you go bust very quickly" – this accountability to results is what's missing from traditional charity and government approaches. However, unlike pure business entrepreneurs, they're driven by "a desire to make their mark on the world" rather than just financial gain.

> "What marks out social entrepreneurs from business entrepreneurs and other kinds of charitable and public-sector workers is that they are not driven solely by financial profit or ideology, or by a career or a pension scheme. Instead they are often driven by a desire to make their mark on the world."
> _Original: Same as above_
**Quick Take**: Apply business discipline (measuring results, scaling what works, cutting what fails) to social initiatives while maintaining focus on impact over profit.

## Best Quotes

- "As a young man I was bought up on a diet of liberal theological education, the virtues of philanthropy and a healthy suspicion of business. Twenty-four years later the realities of working at the heart of some of Britain's poorest estates had turned me into a social entrepreneur, committed to applying business principles to social issues."

- "Social entrepreneurs know from hard-won experience that the trick is first to demonstrate what you are proposing to do for people in a small and tangible way and then to expand the sense of possibility. What you say and do really matters to people: seeing is believing. Integrity is the name of the game."
  _Original: Same as above_

- "I have learned this in my own experience, from people who have stayed the course and created real participation and change in communities – not through a three-year government programme but over perhaps a quarter of a century of emotional and actual investment in a place and the people there."

## Action Items

- **Start small and tangible**: Instead of writing grand plans, find one concrete problem you can solve with visible results
- **Commit to place**: Choose one community or neighborhood and dedicate yourself to long-term engagement
- **Build relationships first**: Spend more time listening to and understanding people than developing programs
- **Create shared spaces**: Design environments where different groups can naturally interact and collaborate
- **Apply business thinking**: Measure what works, scale successful approaches, and be willing to abandon failed experiments

## Questions to Consider

- Are you starting with people's real needs or with theoretical solutions?
- Are you willing to stay in one place long enough to see real change?
- Do you have the courage to challenge conventional wisdom about social problems?
- Are you building bridges between different groups in your community?
- How can you apply business discipline to social issues without losing sight of human impact?

## Conclusion
"The Social Entrepreneur" is a powerful challenge to both liberal consensus thinking and bureaucratic approaches to social change. Mawson's message is both inspiring and uncomfortable: real transformation happens through long-term, hands-on commitment rather than through policy papers and government programs. His story of the Bromley-by-Bow Centre demonstrates that entrepreneurial thinking, applied with deep human connection, can succeed where decades of traditional approaches have failed.

This book is worth your time if you're tired of endless meetings with no results, if you believe that real change is possible but frustrated by how slowly it happens, or if you're looking for a practical roadmap for applying business thinking to social problems. The biggest reason to read it? Mawson proves that one person, committed to staying the course and willing to get their hands dirty, can indeed change the world – one relationship at a time.
