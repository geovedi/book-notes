# A Proposed Treatment Connection for Borderline Personality Disorder (BPD)
**Authors**: Ashley Doyle LISW-CP | **Year**: 2012

## Summary
This groundbreaking academic paper proposes a novel therapeutic approach for individuals diagnosed with both Borderline Personality Disorder (BPD) and Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) by combining two previously separate treatment modalities: Dialectical Behavior Therapy (DBT) and Traumatic Incident Reduction (TIR).

The author argues that while DBT has proven effective for BPD symptom management, it doesn't address underlying trauma. By suggesting a sequential approach—DBT first for stabilization, followed by TIR for trauma resolution—the paper offers hope for more complete recovery for this complex dual-diagnosis population that traditionally has poor treatment outcomes.

**This work is essential reading for mental health professionals working with trauma survivors, BPD specialists, and anyone interested in innovative therapeutic approaches for complex mental health conditions.** Readers will gain valuable insights into the theoretical conflicts between treatment modalities and a proposed solution for better patient outcomes.

## Core Insights

### The BPD-PTSD Connection
Research shows overwhelming co-morbidity between BPD and PTSD, with studies indicating 25-56% of BPD patients also meet PTSD criteria. The high prevalence of childhood trauma—particularly sexual abuse (75-86%)—in BPD patients suggests trauma may be causal rather than coincidental. This challenges traditional diagnostic boundaries and raises questions about whether BPD represents a chronic form of PTSD that has become integrated into personality structure.

> "The high prevalence of sexual abuse, as opposed to other forms of abuse, is thought to be uniquely correlated with BPD."

**Quick Take**: The diagnostic separation between BPD and PTSD may be artificial—treating them as interconnected rather than separate conditions could revolutionize treatment approaches.

### DBT: Essential Foundation But Incomplete Solution
Dialectical Behavior Therapy has revolutionized BPD treatment through its biosocial theory approach, combining individual therapy, skills groups, phone consultations, and team meetings. DBT's four modules (mindfulness, emotion regulation, interpersonal effectiveness, distress tolerance) teach crucial coping skills. However, DBT primarily manages symptoms rather than resolving underlying trauma.

> "Unfortunately, DBT primarily teaches the client to tolerate and manage their disorder. It is a treatment for symptoms as opposed to a cure for the disorder."

**Quick Take**: DBT provides essential stabilization but may leave trauma-processed patients with ongoing PTSD symptoms that require direct intervention.

### TIR: Direct Trauma Resolution
Traumatic Incident Reduction offers a person-centered approach that processes traumatic memories until reaching an "end point"—where emotional charge is eliminated and memories become objective perceptions rather than debilitating experiences. Unlike coping techniques, TIR aims for permanent resolution rather than symptom management.

> "Through the workings of TIR, the memory is processed and becomes the adult's perception of the event, free from emotional attachment."

**Quick Take**: TIR's structured approach can eliminate PTSD symptoms by processing trauma to completion, but requires emotional stability that BPD patients typically lack.

### The Sequential Treatment Model
The paper's core innovation proposes using DBT first (minimum one year) to develop emotional regulation skills, then gradually introducing TIR for trauma processing. This addresses theoretical conflicts: DBT avoids trauma processing due to emotional dysregulation risks, while TIR requires emotional stability to be effective.

> "It is proposed that the best, most effective and ethical treatment for someone with the dual-diagnosis of PTSD and BPD would be to successfully complete DBT for a year, and then undergo TIR gradually."

**Quick Take**: Sequential treatment could offer the best of both worlds—DBT's stabilization plus TIR's trauma resolution.

## Best Quotes

- "Individuals with BPD have experienced invalidation, creating a learned helplessness attitude applicable to all life areas. DBT teaches the client how to have a balanced way of living, focusing on three problem areas: emotion regulation, interpersonal effectiveness, and distress tolerance."

- "BPD has become an area of interest and focus to a number of human service providers. The increase interest can be attributed to the high percentage of BPD individuals admitted into psychiatric units, both inpatient and outpatient; 19% and 11% respectively."

- "I have a strong belief that I had to have DBT before TIR. I think everything has a natural order to things. DBT prepared me to handle the intense emotional stuff to do the PTSD work and not get lost in it."

- "The slow emotional decline inhibits the individual's ability to process traumatic events due to the arousal that is evoked during typical trauma treatment."

- "All that trauma has been locked up in my muscles, and I need to release that. I don't want to get caught up in the past. I want to work through it."

## Clinical Applications

- **Sequential Treatment Planning**: Consider implementing DBT first for BPD-PTSD patients before trauma processing
- **Assessment Refinement**: Evaluate BPD patients for underlying PTSD trauma that may require targeted intervention
- **Skills Integration**: Use DBT distress tolerance skills to support patients through TIR trauma processing
- **Collaborative Care**: Coordinate between DBT and trauma specialists for comprehensive treatment

## Questions to Consider

1. If BPD often represents trauma response, should diagnostic boundaries be reconsidered?
2. How can clinicians determine when BPD patients are ready for trauma processing?
3. What additional research is needed to validate sequential treatment approaches?
4. Could other treatment modalities benefit from similar sequential integration?
5. How might insurance and healthcare systems accommodate longer, integrated treatment protocols?

## Conclusion
This paper offers a compelling theoretical framework for addressing one of mental health's most challenging treatment populations. While the proposed DBT-TIR sequential approach remains theoretical and requires empirical validation, it provides a thoughtful solution to the theoretical conflict between trauma processing and emotional stability requirements.

**The integration of these evidence-based treatments represents exactly the kind of innovative thinking needed in mental health care.** For clinicians frustrated by BPD's traditionally poor prognosis, this approach offers hope for more complete recovery rather than lifetime symptom management.

The proposed treatment connection deserves serious consideration and research investment—it could fundamentally improve outcomes for patients who have historically been considered among the most difficult to treat effectively.
