# The Science of Economics
**Authors**: Raymond Makewell | **Year**: 2012

## Summary
"The Science of Economics" presents a revolutionary approach to understanding economic systems through the lens of natural law and justice. Based on Leon MacLaren's teachings at the School of Economic Science, this book challenges conventional economic wisdom by proposing that economics should serve humanity rather than dominate it. The work reveals how economic arrangements can either facilitate human development or create systems of injustice and servitude.

The book is essential reading for economists, policymakers, and anyone seeking to understand how economic systems can be structured to promote human freedom, dignity, and prosperity. Readers will gain a profound understanding of how natural laws govern economic relationships and how ignorance of these laws leads to poverty, inequality, and social dysfunction.

## Core Insights

### The Three Fundamental Factors of Production
Economics begins with three essential elements: human beings, land, and work. Unlike modern economics that focuses on capital and consumption, this framework recognizes that all wealth creation stems from the interaction between human labour and land. The dry surface of the earth is the stage where human creativity transforms natural resources into goods and services that sustain civilization.

> "The principles that guide us, in public and in private, as they are not of our devising, but moulded into the nature and the essence of things, will endure with the sun and the moon."
> _Edmund Burke, as quoted in the book_

**Quick Take**: Real wealth creation happens when people work the land, not when money circulates through financial markets.

### The Point of Interaction - Where Systems Shape Outcomes
The crucial insight is that economic outcomes are determined at the "point of interaction" where land and labour meet. This point is influenced by laws, customs, and institutions that can either support natural productive capacity or hinder it. The same land and labour in different institutional contexts produce vastly different results.

> "If the conditions at the point of interaction are based on knowledge of natural law, the community will truly serve its members and bring them toward fulfilment of their potential."

**Quick Take**: Economic systems succeed or fail based on whether their institutional arrangements align with natural justice.

### Economic Justice as Natural Law
Following Justinian's definition, justice means rendering to each person their due - particularly the full fruits of their labour. Economic injustice occurs when systems allow some to accumulate wealth by denying others their rightful earnings. This creates a master-servant dynamic where genuine freedom is impossible.

> "Some men work to maintain others who labour not. That is unjust." - Leon MacLaren

**Quick Take**: True economic freedom requires that everyone keeps what they earn through their own efforts.

### The Seven-Level Social Hierarchy
Society operates as a natural hierarchy from individual labourers up to the human race itself. Understanding these levels (villages, towns, commercial centres, nations, cultures, civilizations, and mankind) reveals how economic activity fits within broader social development. Each level serves and influences those below it.

**Quick Take**: Economic systems must be understood within their proper social and cultural context, not as isolated mechanisms.

### The Economic Cycle and Statistical Laws
Production follows a natural cycle from natural resources through raw materials, tools, direction, selling, and finally consumption. This cycle operates according to statistical laws that balance supply and demand but are indifferent to individual outcomes. These laws can appear cruel when not guided by higher principles of justice.

**Quick Take**: Market mechanisms work efficiently but need higher-level guidance to ensure just outcomes.

## Best Quotes

- "Our subject is Economics. Through this study we shall aim to discover the natural laws which govern the relations between men in society, and the laws, customs and practices by which communities are governed."

- "The purpose of society is that, by cooperation men may grow in skill, happiness and knowledge, thus leading to prosperity in every sense."

- "It became very clear to me that there was such a thing as truth and there was such a thing as justice, and that they could be found and, being found, could be taught."

- "During the potato famines in Ireland in the 19th century, peasants died from starvation while their wheat, barley, butter and meat were being exported. The real cause of the trouble was not the failure of the potato crop but the peasants' poverty."

- "There is nothing petty about Economics. If it begins to appear petty then we have lost our way in a fog of detail and it is time to step back and widen our view."

## Action Items

- Study the natural laws governing economic relationships rather than focusing solely on statistical outcomes
- Examine how institutional arrangements at the "point of interaction" affect economic justice in your community
- Distinguish between capital as "wealth employed to produce more wealth" versus money as mere claims on wealth
- Consider whether economic policies support human freedom and development or create dependency
- Evaluate how land tenure systems affect wealth distribution in your society

## Questions to Consider

- How might economic systems change if we prioritized human development over consumption?
- What institutional barriers prevent people from receiving the full fruits of their labour?
- How can we align economic arrangements with natural law and justice?
- What role should communities play in ensuring economic freedom for all members?
- How might understanding the seven-level hierarchy change our approach to economic policy?

## Conclusion
"The Science of Economics" offers a profound alternative to mainstream economic thinking by grounding the subject in natural law and human dignity. While some readers may find its rejection of conventional economic assumptions challenging, the book provides a coherent framework for understanding how economic systems can serve human flourishing rather than human subservitude.

The book is worth your time if you're seeking deeper understanding of why economic systems often fail to deliver prosperity despite unprecedented productive capacity. Its greatest contribution is revealing how economic justice is not merely a political preference but a natural requirement for sustainable prosperity. For anyone frustrated by the apparent failure of modern economics to address inequality, environmental degradation, and human alienation, this work offers both diagnosis and prescription.
