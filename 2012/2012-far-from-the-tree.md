# Far From the Tree
**Andrew Solomon** | **Year**: 2012

## Summary
"Far From the Tree" explores the profound challenges and transformative journey of parents raising children who are fundamentally different from themselves—what Solomon terms "horizontal identities." Drawing from a decade of research and over 300 families, the book investigates how parents navigate loving children who are deaf, dwarfs, autistic, schizophrenic, transgender, prodigies, or conceived in rape. Solomon argues that while most children share "vertical identities" (traits passed down from parents like ethnicity, language, and religion), horizontal identities represent traits that children must acquire from peer groups outside the family.

This book is essential for parents, educators, and anyone seeking to understand the nature of identity, acceptance, and unconditional love. Readers will gain deep insights into how difference can become a source of strength rather than division, and how families can find meaning in raising children whose experiences diverge dramatically from their own.

## Core Insights

### Vertical vs. Horizontal Identities
Solomon introduces a revolutionary framework for understanding identity development. Vertical identities include attributes and values passed down from parent to child across generations through DNA and shared cultural norms—ethnicity, language, nationality, religion. These identities are reinforced by family and society. Horizontal identities, however, are traits that are foreign to parents and must be acquired from peer groups: deafness, dwarfism, autism, schizophrenia, transgender identity, genius, disability. Most gay children are born to straight parents; most deaf children to hearing parents. These children must forge their identities outside the family unit, creating unique challenges for both parents and children.

> "There is no such thing as reproduction. When two people decide to have a baby, they engage in an act of production, and the widespread use of the word reproduction for this activity, with its implication that two people are but braiding themselves together, is at best a euphemism to comfort prospective parents before they get in over their heads."

**Quick Take**: Recognizing whether your child's identity is vertical or horizontal helps understand where they'll need support—from family or from their peer community.

### The Transformative Power of Acceptance
The book reveals how parents who move from grief and resistance to genuine acceptance experience profound personal transformation. Many parents initially view their child's difference as a tragedy or loss, mourning the child they expected. However, those who embrace their child's actual identity often discover expanded capacity for love, deeper wisdom, and unexpected joy. This journey requires what Solomon calls "an exercise for the imagination"—loving someone not for the best of ourselves in them, but entirely for themselves.

> "We must love them for themselves, and not for the best of ourselves in them, and that is a great deal harder to do. Loving our own children is an exercise for the imagination."

**Quick Take**: True acceptance isn't just tolerating difference—it's expanding your capacity to love someone exactly as they are, not as you wished them to be.

### Community as Lifeline
Solomon demonstrates how horizontal identity communities provide essential validation, language, and belonging that families alone cannot offer. Deaf culture, dwarf communities, autistic self-advocacy networks, and transgender peer groups supply what parents cannot: lived experience, shared understanding, and models of thriving with the same difference. These communities teach children that their difference is not a defect but a variation in human experience, worthy of pride rather than shame.

> "Many stumble upon Deaf identity in adolescence, and it comes as a great liberation. They move into a world that validates Sign as a language and discover themselves."

**Quick Take**: Connecting your child to their identity community is as crucial as providing family love—both are essential for thriving.

### The Myth of Normalcy
Through extensive research, Solomon dismantles the concept of "normal" as a cultural construct that excludes and devalues human variation. He explores controversial topics like genetic selection, cochlear implants, and treatment decisions, revealing how prejudice against difference masquerades as medical concern. The book challenges readers to question whether "fixing" difference serves the child or society's comfort with conformity.

> "The question is whether we will maintain a social system that makes allowance for unpredictability, or whether we will increasingly sanitize the human experience."

**Quick Take**: Before trying to "fix" a difference, ask whether you're helping your child or merely making society more comfortable.

### Resilience Through Adversity
Remarkably, many children with horizontal identities develop extraordinary resilience, creativity, and empathy through navigating difference. Solomon shows how overcoming challenges can forge strength rather than brokenness. The book profiles individuals who have turned their differences into sources of meaning, advocacy, and artistic expression—suggesting that the struggle itself can be transformative and valuable.

**Quick Take**: Don't underestimate your child's capacity to find strength in the very differences you fear will break them.

## Best Quotes

- "Parenthood abruptly catapults us into a permanent relationship with a stranger, and the more alien the stranger, the stronger the whiff of negativity."

- "Children whose defining quality annihilates that fantasy of immortality are a particular insult; we must love them for themselves, and not for the best of ourselves in them."

- "There is no such thing as a baby—meaning that if you set out to describe a baby, you will find you are describing a baby and someone. A baby cannot exist alone but is essentially part of a relationship."

- "Insofar as our children resemble us, they are our most precious admirers, and insofar as they differ, they can be our most vehement detractors."

- "Communication and the pursuit of intimacy are central to being human. The idea that one could deliberately deprive a child of the capacity for language is morally suspect."

## Action Items

- **Examine Your Expectations**: Identify what expectations you're projecting onto your child versus who they truly are.

- **Find Their Community**: Research and connect with organizations and communities where your child's identity is celebrated, not just tolerated.

- **Listen Without Fixing**: Practice hearing your child's experience without immediately trying to solve or normalize it.

- **Educate Yourself**: Learn about your child's identity from people who share it, not just from medical or expert perspectives.

- **Advocate Systemically**: Support policies and practices that accommodate difference rather than trying to eliminate it.

## Questions to Consider

- What parts of your child's identity threaten your own sense of self, and why?

- Are you supporting your child's actual identity, or your version of what that identity should be?

- How can you distinguish between genuine medical needs and attempts to make your child more "normal"?

- What communities does your child need that you cannot provide?

- How has your child's difference expanded your capacity for love and understanding?

## Conclusion

"Far From the Tree" is a monumental work that will forever change how you think about family, identity, and human difference. Solomon combines rigorous research with profound empathy to explore families who have learned to love children who are radically different from themselves. The book's greatest strength is its refusal to offer easy answers while providing deep wisdom about the nature of acceptance.

This is essential reading not just for parents of children with differences, but for anyone who has ever struggled to love someone who challenges their expectations. Solomon's central insight—that loving someone truly different from ourselves requires us to expand our imagination—offers a roadmap for deeper love and acceptance in all relationships.

The book is demanding (nearly 1,000 pages) but rewards every moment spent with its stories of struggle, resistance, and ultimately, transcendent love. You'll finish with a more expansive understanding of human possibility and the extraordinary capacity of both parents and children to find meaning in difference.
