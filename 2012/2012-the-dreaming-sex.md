**Authors**: Mike Ashley (Editor) | **Year**: 2012
**Category**: Fantasy & Science Fiction

## Summary
"The Dreaming Sex" is a groundbreaking anthology that challenges the long-held misconception that science fiction was exclusively a male domain before World War II. Editor Mike Ashley brings together a selection of early science fiction short stories by Victorian and Edwardian women writers, proving that women were not just present in the genre's formative years but were instrumental in shaping its development.

The book opens with a comprehensive introduction that reveals how women like Mary Shelley (author of "Frankenstein," often considered the first true science fiction novel) were pioneers of the genre. The anthology demonstrates that women writers brought unique perspectives to scientific speculation, often exploring different angles on technological and scientific advances than their male counterparts.

This essential collection serves as both literary recovery and historical corrective, offering readers the chance to discover forgotten voices in science fiction history while understanding the social barriers these women overcame to contribute to the genre.

## Core Insights

### Women Created Science Fiction
Contrary to popular belief, women didn't just participate in early science fiction—they founded it. Mary Shelley's "Frankenstein" (1818) is identified by science fiction historian Brian W. Aldiss as the point where "true science fiction was born." The anthology reveals how Margaret Cavendish, Duchess of Newcastle, wrote one of the earliest science fiction works, "The Description of a New World, Called the Blazing World" in 1666—creating a neighboring world where a woman becomes ruler.

> "It was a woman who created the field of scientific fiction, and this anthology celebrates that by looking at other contributions by other women during the century following Frankenstein."

**Quick Take**: Science fiction owes its very existence to women writers, a fact that has been systematically erased from mainstream genre history.

### Systemic Barriers to Scientific Education
The anthology exposes how institutional sexism deliberately prevented women from accessing scientific education. Elizabeth Garrett only became a doctor in 1865 by exploiting a loophole in the Society of Apothecaries regulations—which was immediately closed after her qualification. The Royal Astronomical Society awarded Caroline Herschel its Gold Medal in 1828 but didn't honor another woman until 1996.

> "Were they limited? If they were it was because the scientific establishment imposed the barriers. It was almost impossible for women in the Victorian or Edwardian era to gain a scientific education."

Even Marie Curie, despite winning two Nobel Prizes (1903, 1911), was refused membership in the French Academy of Sciences.

**Quick Take**: The absence of women in early science fiction wasn't due to lack of interest or ability, but systematic exclusion from scientific institutions.

### Women Speculated on All Scientific Possibilities
Victorian and Edwardian women writers explored the full spectrum of science fiction themes, from technological advances to social implications. The anthology mentions stories about slowing aging, photographing thoughts, enhancing human senses, invisibility, other dimensions, and synthetic companions.

Jane Webb's "The Mummy!" (1827) took Frankenstein's concept further by creating a scientifically advanced future where reviving the dead was possible. Mary Griffith's "Three Hundred Years Hence" (1836) described a utopia with women's emancipation and abolished slavery. Jean Delaire's "Around a Distant Star" (1904) featured faster-than-light travel and time viewing technology.

> "Women had considerable interest in what science might bring, as the following stories show. Here you will find thoughts on how to slow down the ageing process, how to photograph thoughts, how to enhance our natural senses, whether we can become invisible, whether there might be another dimension around us..."

**Quick Take**: Women science fiction writers were technologically imaginative and socially progressive, using the genre to explore both scientific possibilities and alternative social structures.

### Persistent Underestimation of Women Writers
The anthology reveals how prejudice against women in science fiction persisted well into the 20th century. Hugo Gernsback, publisher of the first science fiction magazine "Amazing Stories," expressed surprise in 1926 when a woman won his writing contest.

> "As a rule, women do not make good scientifiction writers because their education and general tendencies on scientific matters are usually limited."

This demonstrates how the myth of women's absence from early science fiction was actively perpetuated by the genre's gatekeepers, creating a self-fulfilling prophecy that marginalized women writers.

**Quick Take**: The perception of science fiction as male-dominated wasn't accidental—it was actively maintained by influential editors and publishers.

## Best Quotes

- "This anthology will prove that wrong. One thing that science fiction sets out to do is to speculate on what new advances in science and technology might achieve, and there were many women just as interested in that prospect as men."
- "Few of these names will be known today, and that only underlines the point that, despite there being a significant amount of scientific fiction written by women in the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, it has been forgotten."
- "Caroline Herschel, for instance, the sister of the Astronomer Royal, Wilhelm Herschel, was an excellent astronomer in her own right, discovering several comets and producing an important catalogue of nebulae."
- "Ada Lovelace, the daughter of Lord Byron. She became a first-class mathematician and worked with Charles Babbage on his famous 'Difference Engine' and 'Analytical Engine'... She even wrote the equivalent of a program for the machine, with the result that she is considered the world's first computer programmer – back in 1843!"
- "Apart from the first and final stories, the contents are arranged in the order in which they were first published, so as to follow the emergence of ideas."

## Key Discoveries

- **Literary Recovery**: The anthology recovers dozens of forgotten women science fiction writers from the Victorian and Edwardian eras, making their work accessible to modern readers.
- **Historical Correction**: It systematically dismantles the myth that women only entered science fiction after World War II, showing their continuous presence from the genre's inception.
- **Scientific Context**: The book provides historical context about the real scientific barriers women faced, helping readers understand the social significance of these literary contributions.
- **Thematic Diversity**: The stories in the anthology cover the full range of science fiction themes, proving women writers were as technically and imaginatively ambitious as their male counterparts.

## Questions to Consider

- How many other foundational contributions by women to other genres or fields have been similarly erased from history?
- What barriers still exist today that prevent women and other marginalized groups from participating equally in speculative fiction?
- How might science fiction have developed differently if women's contributions had been recognized and built upon rather than forgotten?
- What other "firsts" in literature and science might need to be reexamined for overlooked female contributors?
- How does understanding this history change our appreciation of contemporary women science fiction writers?

## Conclusion
"The Dreaming Sex" is essential reading for anyone interested in science fiction history, women's literature, or the intersection of gender and scientific progress. It's not just an anthology—it's a work of literary archaeology that unearths buried treasures and reconstructs our understanding of how science fiction began.

The book's greatest strength is its dual nature: it's both a scholarly introduction that provides crucial historical context and a collection of entertaining stories that stand on their own literary merits. Mike Ashley's extensive research and clear writing make the introduction as valuable as the stories themselves.

This is worth your time because it fundamentally changes how you understand science fiction's origins. The biggest reason to read it is to discover that many of the genre's foundational ideas—scientific speculation, social commentary, technological imagination—were being explored by women writers from the very beginning, and their continued marginalization represents one of literature's greatest injustices. Reading these recovered works isn't just about historical accuracy; it's about restoring missing voices that could enrich and diversify our understanding of what science fiction can be.
