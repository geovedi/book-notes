# Science Lesson Plans for KS1
**Authors**: Pam Larkins | **Year**: 2012

## Summary
This comprehensive resource provides 10 structured science lesson plans designed specifically for Key Stage 1 students (ages 5-7), focusing on the National Curriculum topic of "Sorting and Using Materials." Each lesson follows a consistent pedagogical framework with clear learning objectives, hands-on activities, assessment strategies, and cross-curricular integration opportunities.

Perfect for early years and primary teachers seeking ready-to-implement science investigations that develop both subject knowledge and scientific enquiry skills. The lessons progress systematically from basic material exploration to practical applications, ensuring students build understanding through concrete experiences.

## Core Insights

### 🔬 Hands-On Material Exploration Framework
The book introduces materials science through sensory-based exploration, helping young children develop observation skills and scientific vocabulary. Each lesson begins with concrete experiences using everyday objects, allowing children to build understanding through touch, sight, and interaction before moving to abstract concepts.

> "Children will make simple general observations, using all their senses, about a variety of everyday objects and materials."

**Quick Take**: Start every material science unit with sensory exploration using familiar objects to build confidence and vocabulary.

### 📊 Structured Lesson Plan Methodology
Each lesson follows a consistent three-part structure: Introduction (engaging hook), Main Lesson (hands-on activities), and Plenary (reflection and consolidation). This framework provides teachers with a reliable template while allowing flexibility for different learning styles and classroom needs.

> "Within the lessons are opportunities to develop knowledge, skills and understanding from firsthand experience as well as developing investigative skills."

**Quick Take**: Use the Intro-Main-Plenary structure to ensure balanced lessons that engage, explore, and consolidate learning.

### 🧪 Scientific Enquiry Skills Development
The lessons explicitly teach the scientific process through prediction, observation, testing, and conclusion. Children learn to make fair tests, record findings, and draw evidence-based conclusions - foundational skills for future scientific learning.

> "They will make simple predictions and use appropriate simple scientific vocabulary to describe their observations and use their results to draw simple conclusions."

**Quick Take**: Embed scientific enquiry skills into every material investigation rather than teaching them as separate concepts.

### 🔄 Problem-Based Learning Context
Materials are explored through meaningful contexts and problems (Teddy's day out, helping Polly choose curtains, finding the best cleaning cloth). This approach connects abstract material properties to real-world applications, making learning relevant and memorable.

> "Children will investigate and explore properties of different materials. They will use their knowledge of materials to make simple predictions and draw conclusions from their observations and activities in order to solve problems."

**Quick Take**: Frame material investigations as problem-solving scenarios to increase engagement and understanding of practical applications.

### 💡 Cross-Curricular Integration Opportunities
Each lesson includes specific links to mathematics (data handling, sorting), literacy (recording findings, descriptive language), and ICT (digital recording, interactive resources). This integrated approach maximizes learning time and demonstrates how science connects to other subjects.

> "Extension activities for cross curricular work that include ICT opportunities as well as assessment."

**Quick Take**: Plan explicit cross-curricular connections to reinforce learning and make efficient use of curriculum time.

## Best Quotes
- "These 10 Science Lessons cover the programs of study for Key Stage 1 Science as set out in the National Curriculum and are also based around the QCA topic 'Sorting and Using Materials'."
- "Children will sort materials into groups on the basis of their observations."
- "Discuss how you can't always tell by sight what an object is made of e.g. glass and plastic, and have to use other senses such as touch and sound."
- "Are big magnets always stronger than small magnets?"
- "How could we make the test fair – does it matter if sometimes we are nearer to the curtain than at other times?"

## Action Items
- **Set up material exploration stations** with everyday objects for sensory investigation
- **Create descriptive word banks** with visual supports for material properties vocabulary
- **Prepare investigation recording sheets** with picture-based response options for early learners
- **Gather magnet investigation kits** with various magnetic and non-magnetic objects
- **Design problem-solving scenarios** using teddy bears or characters to contextualize material testing

## Questions to Consider
- How can we encourage children to use scientific vocabulary naturally during play?
- What opportunities exist in our daily environment for material exploration?
- How can we extend these investigations for more advanced learners while maintaining accessibility?
- What real-world problems in our school community could involve material testing?

## Conclusion
This practical resource delivers exactly what early years teachers need: ready-to-use, curriculum-aligned science lessons that develop both content knowledge and scientific thinking skills. The strength lies in its consistent structure, hands-on approach, and emphasis on understanding through doing rather than memorizing facts.

The biggest reason to use this book is its comprehensive approach to developing scientific enquiry skills alongside material knowledge. Students don't just learn that wood is hard or metal is shiny - they learn how to observe, test, predict, and conclude like real scientists. These foundational skills transfer across all subject areas and support lifelong learning habits.

For teachers feeling uncertain about teaching science to young children, this resource provides the structure, confidence, and engaging activities needed to create memorable learning experiences. The investment in these ten lessons pays dividends throughout the entire school year as students apply their investigation skills to new topics and questions.
