# Letting Go: The Pathway of Surrender

The primary purpose of this book is to guide you on how to handle your thoughts and emotions in the most effective way possible. Rather than judging or resisting difficult emotions or negative thoughts, the book advises you to observe them and allow yourself to experience them fully, whether reasonable, bad, beautiful, or ugly. By releasing the label of "bad" from these emotions, they can physically move through and free from the body.

The ultimate goal of our lives each day is to move up the scale of consciousness from fear, worry, and shame to love, joy, and peace. Once we reach that place, healing and abundance, begin to happen effortlessly.

The book suggests that thought is harmless until we believe it. It's not our thoughts themselves but our attachment to our thoughts that causes suffering. A belief is a thought that we have been attaching to, often for years. By releasing our passion for these beliefs and observing them from a neutral perspective, we can reduce our suffering and free ourselves from limiting beliefs that hold us back from living a fulfilling life.

The book suggests that the ultimate goal of life is to live from your spirit. When you experience challenging thoughts or emotions, the awareness that is observing these experiences is your spirit. By acknowledging that your thoughts and feelings are just energy you are participating in the present moment, you can learn to observe them without judgment or attachment.

The author highlights the importance of being in the present moment rather than being constantly preoccupied with the past or future. Creation, miracles, healing, and change can only occur now. Therefore, it is essential to focus on your state of being, which includes your state of consciousness and what you are feeling and thinking. By shifting your attention to your present state of being and feeling, you can cultivate a sense of abundance, gratitude, and positivity that will attract more of these experiences into your life.

The book emphasises the importance of feeling and being rather than constantly striving and doing. By being present and in tune with your inner self, you can create a more fulfilling and joyful life aligned with your valid values and desires.

I agree that one of the most fascinating concepts in the book is the power of the mind over the body. As we move up the levels of consciousness, we begin to understand the profound influence that our spirit has over our mind and body. Rather than focusing solely on physical health and appearance, we learn to connect with our soul and make that our primary focus. We recognise that our spirit is operating our body like a hand controls a glove, and we strive to cultivate a deep connection with it.

The book quotes Viktor Frankl, who said, "Everything can be taken from a man but one thing: the last of the human freedomsâ€”to choose one's attitude in any given set of circumstances, to choose one's own way." This highlights the importance of taking responsibility for our thoughts and emotions, even under challenging circumstances.

The book also emphasises the concept of surrender, which involves having no strong emotions about things and accepting whatever happens. In this state, we are free from attachments and can enjoy something without needing them for our happiness. Acceptance involves recognising that everything is perfect and beautiful, and nothing needs to change. This perspective allows us to focus less on "doingness" and more on the quality of beingness and our inner capacity for caring and lovingness.

###  Emotions can be quantified

Your thoughts and feelings determine various degrees of consciousness and emotion. Emotions are measured on a logarithmic scale ranging from 1 to 1000. Love registers at 500, bravery at 200, fear at 100, and shame at 20. Each level has a distinct frequency that can be sensed unconsciously by others around you and affects everything you do. In essence, like attracts like. Your emotional state, whether a lack or an abundance, joy or anxiety, brings it into your life, and your vibration level unconsciously impacts how other people perceive you.

The subconscious of others can sense what you are feeling and thinking. This implies that your thoughts and feelings when you go to a particular place can impact how others perceive you. 

The law of attraction states that similar vibrations are attracted to one another. Therefore, the frequency you emit determines the people, places, things, and situations that come to you.

Most individuals have an average level of consciousness in which they live. Many people have a painful emotional state, with the average person only increasing their awareness level by five points in their lifetime unless they concentrate on spiritual growth or have a near-death experience. By living from your soul and letting go, you will naturally rise the consciousness scale, abandoning shame, worry, and fear and moving towards more peace, joy, and ultimately, love and enlightenment.

Thoughts and emotions are either bringing abundance or lack, health or imbalance, joy or anxiety. What you appreciate, appreciate.

### Discovering life lesson

Experiencing unpleasant and painful events in life can be incredibly difficult to cope with. However, healing from these events can become more manageable if we focus on finding the life lesson hidden within them. Our subconscious is aware that there is a lesson to be learned from every agonising event, such as the death of a loved one, the breakdown of a marriage, or the loss of a job. Unfortunately, we often resist the opportunity to learn from these experiences.

By accepting and recognising that life events, no matter how challenging they may seem, are opportunities rather than obstacles, we can cultivate a sense of happiness within ourselves. Rather than approaching these events with a negative attitude, we can view them as opportunities for growth and personal development. This shift in mindset allows us to transform what would otherwise be a negative experience into a positive one by learning valuable life lessons that can guide us towards greater self-awareness and self-improvement. Ultimately, embracing life's challenges as opportunities for growth can help us to find greater peace, contentment, and fulfilment in our lives.

### Letting go

Negative emotions should not be feared, ignored, hidden, condemned, or vented. Letting go means relinquishing judgment and acknowledging those adverse feelings for what they are: simply emotions. It involves allowing them to follow their natural course and releasing negative energy. Anger is a higher emotion than apathy since it stimulates you and indicates that you're moving up the consciousness scale. However, it is not a vibrational state to stay in for too long. It would be best if you experienced anger and then let it go to make space for a lighter feeling of willingness, patience, compassion, or surrender.

Letting go and surrendering means sensing that nothing needs to be changed and that everything is perfect. It entails having no powerful emotion about something - it's okay if it happens, and it's okay if it doesn't happen. It involves releasing attachments and enjoying something without requiring it for ongoing happiness. There are no power struggles to be correct, no points to be established, and no judgment. Life flows effortlessly. By persistently practising surrender, one can eventually reach unconditional love.
