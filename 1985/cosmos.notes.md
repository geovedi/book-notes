  - Ptolemy codified Babylonian astrology and linked behavior patterns to celestial influences.
  - Modern astrologers adapted Ptolemy's teachings but ignore some of his astronomical insights.
  - Ptolemy's Earth-centered model of planetary motion hindered astronomy for centuries.
  - Copernicus proposed a heliocentric model, challenging Ptolemy's system, initially banned by the Catholic Church.

## Ionian Revolution and Greek Scientists
  - Ionian revolution in human thought led to advancements in science in Ionia, Greece, Italy, and Sicily.
  - Scientists like Thales, Anaximander, and Anaxagoras made significant contributions to science.
  - Pythagoreans believed in the certainty of mathematical demonstration and the perfect reality of the gods' realm.
  - Greek science declined due to the slave economy and oppressive philosophies of Plato and Aristotle.

## Emergence of Greek Science and Astronomy
  - Greek philosophy, mathematics, and science emerged during a period of great intellectual and spiritual ferment worldwide.
  - Aristarchus' heliocentric theory influenced later scientists, and Huygens' experiment measured the brightness of stars.
