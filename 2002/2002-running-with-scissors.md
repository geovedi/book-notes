# Running with Scissors
**Author**: Augusten Burroughs | **Year**: 2002

## Summary
"Running with Scissors" is a harrowing yet darkly comic memoir about Augusten Burroughs' bizarre and traumatic childhood after his mentally unstable mother abandons him to live in the chaotic household of her unorthodox psychiatrist, Dr. Finch. Set in the 1970s, the book chronicles Augusten's coming-of-age in a decaying pink Victorian mansion where normal rules don't apply—where electroshock therapy machines become toys, Christmas trees remain for years, and a pedophile relationship with a much older man is normalized by the adults meant to protect him.

The memoir serves as both a survivor's tale and a commentary on the failure of mental health systems in the 1970s, showing how a vulnerable child was essentially abandoned to a dysfunctional environment that, while providing escape from an even more dangerous home, exposed him to new forms of neglect and inappropriate boundaries.

This memoir offers profound insights into resilience, the long-term impact of childhood trauma, and how humans can find ways to survive—and even find dark humor—in the most unthinkable circumstances. It's particularly valuable for understanding how children adapt to dysfunction and the lasting effects of parental abandonment and inappropriate adult relationships.

## Core Insights

### The Normalization of Chaos
The book reveals how completely abnormal situations can become normalized when they're all a child knows. The Finch household—with its lack of rules, squalor, and inappropriate boundaries—becomes Augusten's new normal, showing how children adapt to whatever environment they're placed in, no matter how dysfunctional.

> "We were young. We were bored. And the old electroshock therapy machine was just under the stairs in a box next to the Hoover."

**Quick Take**: Children are incredibly adaptable, but this adaptability can also make them vulnerable to accepting dangerous situations as normal.

### The Failure of Adult Authority
Every adult figure in Augusten's life fails him—his mentally ill mother, his distant father, the unorthodox Dr. Finch, and the predatory 33-year-old who becomes his lover. The memoir illustrates how mental health professionals can abuse their power and how systems designed to protect children can break down completely.

> "As spiritually evolved as I may indeed be," Dr. Finch said, eyes twinkling with playfulness, "I'm still a human being. A male human being. I am still very much a man."

**Quick Take**: Professional credentials don't guarantee ethical behavior, and children are most vulnerable when the adults meant to protect them are broken themselves.

### Finding Agency in Helplessness
Despite having no control over his circumstances, Augusten finds small ways to assert agency—through his obsession with cleanliness and appearance, his detailed observations of the Finch family's dysfunction, and eventually his decision to pursue education as an escape route.

> "I'm going to run away to New York City and become a writer."

**Quick Take**: Even in the most powerless situations, finding small ways to assert control can be crucial for psychological survival.

### The Survival Power of Observation
Augusten survives by becoming an anthropologist of his own bizarre life, observing every detail of the dysfunction around him. This habit of noticing everything becomes both his coping mechanism and ultimately his salvation as a writer.

> "You've always been a writer. For as long as I've known you you've had that pointy nose of yours tucked into some notebook. You've lived with my family and noticed every single thing about us."

**Quick Take**: The ability to observe and document one's experience can be a powerful tool for processing trauma and finding meaning in suffering.

### Dark Humor as Survival
Throughout the memoir, Augusten finds humor in the most horrific situations—playing with electroshock machines, the permanence of Christmas trees and turkey bones in the Finch house, the absurdity of his circumstances. This dark humor becomes a coping mechanism that allows him to survive the unsurvivable.

> "Yeah," I said. "We're running alright. Running with scissors."

**Quick Take**: Finding humor in dark situations isn't about making light of trauma—it's about claiming the power to frame one's own narrative.

## Conclusion
"Running with Scissors" is both shocking and essential reading. While the content is often disturbing and the situations described are horrifying, Burroughs' ability to find humor and humanity in the midst of chaos makes this memoir profoundly moving rather than merely depressing.

The book's greatest strength lies in its honesty—Burroughs doesn't sugarcoat his experiences or portray himself as purely heroic. He shows the complexity of surviving trauma, including the ways we adapt to dysfunction and the lasting impact of childhood abandonment. His journey from helpless victim to observant survivor to ultimately successful writer offers hope without resorting to easy sentimentality.

Be prepared for disturbing content, but also for dark humor and ultimately, an inspiring story of survival and self-creation. The biggest reason to read it is Burroughs' masterful ability to find humanity and even comedy in the darkest of situations, showing how storytelling itself can be an act of survival.
