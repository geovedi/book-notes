# The Classic Fairytales
**Original Title**: The Classic Fairytales
**Author**: Charles Way | **Year**: 2002 | **Category**: Children & Young Adult

## Summary
This collection presents three masterful stage adaptations of beloved fairytales—Sleeping Beauty, Cinderella, and Beauty and the Beast—reimagined by acclaimed playwright Charles Way. Originally commissioned for prominent children's theaters in Britain, these adaptations transform familiar stories into sophisticated theatrical explorations of childhood's journey into adulthood. Way never writes down to young audiences; instead, he creates plays that "will excite and stimulate everyone" while particularly resonating with young people's needs and interests.

The collection represents a revolutionary approach to children's theater, embracing Bruno Bettelheim's philosophy that good fairy stories must contain darker elements so that "the young can experience and learn from them." Each adaptation explores different psychological dimensions of growing up: Sleeping Beauty examines the concept of duality, Cinderella charts a journey from darkness to light, and Beauty and the Beast confronts the nature of fear and the subconscious. These plays have been produced internationally—from Britain to Sweden, Russia, and South Africa—demonstrating their universal appeal and artistic merit.

Directors, actors, and young audiences will discover theatrical works that respect children's intelligence while offering profound emotional and psychological depth. Parents and educators seeking meaningful, challenging theatrical experiences for young people will find these adaptations invaluable for their ability to entertain while addressing complex themes of growth, loss, and transformation.

## Core Insights

### The Psychology of Duality in Sleeping Beauty
Way's adaptation of Sleeping Beauty centers on the concept of duality—every character and element embodies complementary aspects. The King and Queen, castle and forest, bright witch and dark witch all represent opposing forces that must be reconciled. This theme finds physical embodiment in Gryff, the half-dragon, half-human character who literally embodies internal conflict and the war within oneself during the journey to maturity.

> "Everyone and everything in the play has a complimentary aspect; King and Queen, Castle and forest, bright witch and dark witch, etc. Gryff, half-dragon, half-human is the physical embodiment of the idea of duality and is at war with himself."

**Quick Take**: This adaptation transforms a simple fairytale into a sophisticated exploration of the internal conflicts children experience while growing up, making the psychological journey visible through dramatic action.

### Healing Through Music in Cinderella
Unlike traditional interpretations, Way's Cinderella focuses on the journey from darkness to light and sickness to health. Every character lives under the influence of loss, and the play explores how people accommodate grief and move forward. The theatrical genius lies in introducing Mozart as a character whose music charts the entire journey toward light and joy, creating a powerful metaphor for how art can heal emotional wounds.

> "Cinderella is a play about a journey from darkness to light, from sickness to health. Everyone in the play is under the influence of some kind of loss, and the play explores these feelings and the sometimes painful route one must take to accommodate them and move on in life."

**Quick Take**: This adaptation uses music as both literal and metaphorical healing force, demonstrating how artistic expression can guide people through grief toward emotional recovery.

### Confronting Fear Through Movement in Beauty and the Beast
Way's version of Beauty and the Beast uses dance and movement to represent the subconscious world and the process of overcoming fear. The play opens with a startling dream sequence before transitioning from a Jane Austen-style drawing room to the wilds of Dartmoor, constantly blurring the line between dreamtime and reality. This approach connects directly to the theatrical experience itself, where audiences are never quite sure if they're in dreams or waking consciousness.

> "This is a play about overcoming fear, and the subconscious world is represented through imagery and movement. The play begins with a startling dream sequence and then segues into the drawing-room world of a Jane Austen novel, before moving to the wilds of Dartmoor."

**Quick Take**: The adaptation uses physical theater and dreamlike ambiguity to help young audiences engage with and overcome their own fears through the safe distance of theatrical experience.

### Theatrical Challenges as Creative Catalysts
Way intentionally sets theatrical challenges for directors and designers, forcing creative innovation rather than allowing complacency. For example, Beauty and the Beast opens with "all the actors in a sequence of contemporary movement, accompanied by a most glorious soundscape," which conceptually establishes the entire production's approach. These challenges ensure that each production remains fresh, relevant, and artistically engaging.

> "Way also likes to set theatrical challenges for both directors and designers, keeping us on our toes and never allowing us to become complacent... Any writer who can make you seriously consider the whole theatrical concept of a play is rare and worthy of note."

**Quick Take**: The plays function as artistic springboards that compel creative teams to innovate, ensuring each production becomes a unique theatrical event rather than a routine reproduction.

### Universal Appeal Beyond Age Boundaries
Way writes with maturity and confidence rare in children's theater, creating works that know no boundaries. His approach ensures that "even very young members of the audience have been totally engrossed, perhaps not understanding everything in the play, but certainly understanding enough." This multi-layered approach allows different age groups to engage with the material at their own level while experiencing the same performance.

> "Way writes with a maturity and confidence that is rare in theatre for children and young people. He never sets out to write a play just for young people, but a play that will excite and stimulate everyone."

**Quick Take**: These adaptations demonstrate that the best children's entertainment respects multiple intelligence levels and creates shared experiences that unite generations rather than dividing them.
