# The Social-Democratic Program: The Foundation Programs of SDB, SDAP and PvdA 1878-1977
**Original Title**: Het sociaal-democratisch programma. De beginselprogramma's van SDB, SDAP en PVDA 1878-1977
**Author**: Bart Tromp | **Year**: 2002 | **Category**: History & Biography

## Summary
This groundbreaking academic study traces the ideological evolution of Dutch social democracy through the foundational principle programs of three successive political parties: the Social-Democratic Bond (SDB), the Social-Democratic Workers' Party (SDAP), and the Labour Party (PvdA). By analyzing how these programs were developed and how their content shifted over nearly a century, Tromp reveals how social democracy transformed from revolutionary Marxism to pragmatic reformism.

The book demonstrates that principle programs serve as the sharpest expression of a political party's ideological identity, making their study the ideal way to track changes in that identity over time. Through meticulous contextual and textual analysis, Tromp shows how Dutch social democracy adapted to changing historical circumstances while maintaining core commitments to social justice and democratic values.

This work is essential reading for political scientists, historians, and anyone interested in understanding how ideological movements evolve and adapt to new realities. It offers profound insights into the tension between revolutionary ideals and pragmatic politics that faces all mass political movements.

## Core Insights

### The Evolution from Revolutionary to Reformist Social Democracy

The study reveals a fundamental transformation from revolutionary Marxism to pragmatic reformism. The SDB (founded 1878) and early SDAP programs were explicitly revolutionary, anticipating the inevitable collapse of capitalism and its replacement by socialism. By contrast, the PvdA's 1977 program represents a thoroughly reformist approach focused on regulating rather than replacing capitalism.

This shift wasn't simply betrayal of original principles but rather a realistic response to historical circumstances. The failure of revolutionary expectations to materialize, the success of democratic reforms, and the integration of the working class into capitalist society all contributed to this transformation.

> "The movement is—crudely speaking—become a N.V. [corporation] for handling the material interests and concerns of groups of industrial workers, without living faith in socialism and without constructive socialist thoughts."
> _Original: "De beweging is - om het kras uit te drukken - geworden tot een N.V. tot behartiging van materiële belangen en belangetjes van groepen van industrie-arbeiders, zonder levend geloof in het socialisme en zonder konstruktieve socialistiese gedachten."_
**Quick Take**: The transformation from revolution to reform represents adaptation rather than abandonment of core values.

### The Centrality of Principle Programs as Ideological Markers

Tromp convincingly argues that principle programs function as the "constitution" of political parties, containing their most carefully formulated theoretical foundations. Unlike electoral programs that address immediate practical demands, principle programs express the party's fundamental analysis of society and its vision for the future.

These documents reveal how parties understand themselves and their relationship to the broader political system. The Dutch social-democratic programs show a shift from seeing the state as an instrument to be seized (early programs) to viewing it as a tool for regulation and reform (later programs).

> "The Principle Program is the Constitution of a political party. It is the carefully prepared summary of the theory that guides its action."
> _Original: "Het Beginselprogramma is de Grondwet van een politieke partij. Het is de zorgvuldig opgestelde samenvatting van de theorie, die haar bij haar actie leidt."_
**Quick Take**: Principle programs offer the most authentic window into a party's ideological identity.

### The Impact of Historical Crises on Ideological Development

Major historical crises served as catalysts for ideological reevaluation and program revision. World War I shattered the internationalist framework of early social democracy. The Great Depression challenged faith in capitalist reformism. The rise of fascism forced reconsideration of democratic commitments. The post-war welfare state success created new ideological challenges.

Each crisis exposed limitations in existing programs and forced parties to confront new realities. The SDAP's 1937 program, for instance, represented a response to both the Depression and the threat of fascism, emphasizing democratic commitments more explicitly than previous programs.

**Quick Take**: Crises accelerate ideological development by exposing the limitations of existing frameworks.

### The Tension Between National and International Perspectives

Dutch social democracy constantly grappled with the tension between international socialist solidarity and national political realities. Early programs emphasized internationalism and the inevitability of worldwide socialist revolution. Later programs increasingly focused on national reforms and the specific Dutch context.

This shift reflects both the practical necessities of national politics and the failure of internationalist expectations to materialize. The success of social democracy increasingly depended on its ability to work within national frameworks rather than transcend them.

**Quick Take**: Successful political movements must balance international ideals with national realities.

### The "Long Twentieth Century" Framework

Tromp situates Dutch social democracy within the framework of the "long twentieth century" (approximately 1880-1970), a period of "organized capitalism" characterized by institutional arrangements that regulated market excesses. The social-democratic programs of this era focused on "bridling capitalism" rather than replacing it.

The crisis of the 1970s marked the end of this era and the beginning of neoliberal dominance. The PvdA's 1977 program, with its verbal radicalism, actually represented the last gasp of this social-democratic consensus rather than its renewal.

> "The social-democratic century ended somewhere in the 1980s or 1990s. Not because capitalism had reached its end, but also not because it had been definitively bridled."
> _Original: "De sociaal-democratische eeuw (Dahrendorf) eindigde ergens in de jaren tachtig of negentig. Vanzelfsprekend niet omdat het kapitalisme toen aan zijn eind was gekomen, maar ook niet omdat het definitief was 'gebreideld'."_
**Quick Take**: Social democracy's golden age was tied to specific historical conditions that no longer exist.

## Questions to Consider

1. **Is social democracy still relevant** in an era of globalization and neoliberal dominance?

2. **What should be the relationship** between principle and pragmatism in progressive politics?

3. **Can the welfare state model be revitalized** or must social democracy develop a new vision for the twenty-first century?

4. **How should political movements balance** national specificities with international solidarity?

5. **What role should ideology play** in an era that often emphasizes pragmatic problem-solving over grand visions?

## Conclusion

This scholarly work is essential reading for anyone seeking to understand the evolution of European social democracy and the broader challenges facing progressive politics in the modern era. Tromp's meticulous research and insightful analysis demonstrate how political movements adapt to changing circumstances while maintaining core commitments to social justice and democratic values.

The book's greatest strength lies in its demonstration that ideological development is not simply a story of betrayal or decline, but rather a complex process of adaptation to changing historical realities. The transformation from revolutionary Marxism to reformist social democracy reflects both the successes and limitations of the social-democratic project.

For contemporary readers concerned about the future of progressive politics, this book offers both sobering lessons and hopeful insights. It shows that political movements must adapt to survive, but also that successful adaptation requires maintaining core values while developing new visions appropriate to changing times. The challenge for twenty-first-century social democracy is to develop a new vision that addresses contemporary realities while building on the movement's historical achievements and values.
