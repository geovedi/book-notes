# The Blindspots Between Us
**Authors**: Gleb Tsipursky | **Year**: 2020
**Category**: Romance & Relationships

## Summary
This groundbreaking book challenges the conventional wisdom to "trust your gut" in relationships, revealing that our intuitive instincts—evolved for survival on the African savanna—are dangerously mismatched for modern social connections. Tsipursky, a behavioral science expert and disaster avoidance specialist, demonstrates how unconscious cognitive biases systematically undermine our relationships with romantic partners, friends, family, and colleagues. The core premise is that we all possess mental blindspots that lead us to misjudge others, misinterpret situations, and make relationship-damaging decisions despite our best intentions.

What sets this book apart is its focus on practical solutions rather than just problems. Tsipursky combines cutting-edge research with real-world case studies to show how specific cognitive biases manifest in everyday interactions, then provides science-based strategies anyone can implement immediately. The book addresses twelve critical biases, from the fundamental attribution error to tribalism, offering concrete debiasing techniques that help relationships not just survive but thrive. Readers gain understanding of why their relationship efforts sometimes backfire and, more importantly, learn how to recognize and correct these mental errors in real-time.

This book is essential for anyone who finds themselves repeating frustrating relationship patterns, professionals seeking to improve workplace dynamics, or anyone interested in psychology and personal growth. If you've ever wondered why good intentions sometimes lead to damaged relationships, or why traditional relationship advice fails when you need it most, this guide provides the missing piece: understanding the hidden mental processes that sabotage our best efforts and gaining practical tools to overcome them.

## Core Insights

### The Two Systems: Autopilot vs. Intentional Thinking
Our brains operate with two distinct systems: the **autopilot system** (fast, intuitive, emotional) and the **intentional system** (slow, deliberate, rational). The autopilot system, like a powerful elephant, dominates our daily decisions and reactions. The intentional system, like the elephant's rider, can guide our thinking but requires significant mental energy. Most cognitive biases stem from autopilot system errors—snap judgments that made sense for ancient survival but cause relationship disasters today. The key insight is that we can train our intentional system to recognize when the autopilot is making mistakes and intentionally shift to more deliberate thinking for important relationship decisions.

> "Our intentional system can be trained to spot situations where we're likely to make mistakes due to cognitive biases and correct these errors."
**Quick Take**: Before reacting emotionally in relationships, practice the "pause and redirect" technique—take a conscious breath to engage your intentional system before responding.

### Fundamental Attribution Error: The Biggest Relationship Killer
We tend to judge others by their character while judging ourselves by our circumstances. When someone cuts us off in traffic, they're a jerk; when we cut someone off, we're running late. This **fundamental attribution error** causes us to assume others' negative behaviors reflect their personality rather than situational factors, leading to unfair judgments and damaged relationships. Tsipursky shows how this bias systematically undermines trust and connection, causing us to attribute malicious intent to actions that might have innocent explanations.

> "Snap judgments are notoriously unreliable, and unlike our ancestors on the prehistoric savanna, we modern people don't need to make such judgments for our survival in the vast majority of cases."
**Quick Take**: When someone's behavior upsets you, deliberately consider three situational explanations before jumping to character conclusions.

### Tribalism and the Halo/Horn Effects
Our brains evolved to quickly categorize people as "us" vs. "them" for survival, but this tribal instinct creates serious relationship problems through the **halo effect** (overvaluing qualities of those we like) and **horn effect** (undervaluing qualities of those we dislike). These biases cause us to make distorted judgments about people based on group affiliation rather than individual merit. In relationships, this manifests as overlooking red flags in partners we're attracted to (halo effect) or dismissing valid concerns from friends we're annoyed with (horn effect).

> "The halo effect sometimes masks friendships that no longer serve you well."
**Quick Take**: Regularly evaluate relationships based on current behavior rather than past impressions or group affiliations.

### The Illusion of Transparency: Overestimating How Well Others Understand Us
We systematically overestimate how clearly our thoughts, feelings, and intentions come across to others. This **illusion of transparency** causes us to assume others understand our unspoken needs, emotions, and boundaries, leading to frustrating misunderstandings and hurt feelings. In reality, others can't read our minds as well as we think they can, and we need to communicate more explicitly than feels natural to avoid relationship conflicts.

> "Your 'obvious' feelings aren't obvious at all to others—they often have no clue what you're experiencing inside."
**Quick Take**: Assume others understand less than you think and practice expressing your feelings and needs clearly and explicitly.

### The Empathy Gap: Underestimating Emotional Impacts
When we're in a calm state, we dramatically underestimate how strongly emotions will affect us (and others) in hot states. This **empathy gap** causes us to make decisions about relationships when we're level-headed that we later regret when emotions intensify. We also fail to anticipate how our actions will emotionally impact others, leading to unintended hurt and relationship damage.

> "When we're cold, we can't imagine how we'll feel when we're hot, and vice versa."
**Quick Take**: Make important relationship decisions when you're calm, but consider how they might feel during emotional moments.

## Action Items
- **Practice mindful pauses**: Before reacting emotionally in relationships, take three conscious breaths to engage your intentional system
- **Implement the "10-second rule"**: When upset, delay your response for at least 10 seconds to avoid autopilot reactions
- **Keep a bias journal**: Document instances where you catch yourself making cognitive biases in relationships
- **Seek external perspectives**: Regularly ask trusted friends for objective views on your relationship situations
- **Use consider-the-opposite technique**: Deliberately argue against your initial judgments about others' behavior
- **Make precommitments**: Tell others about your biases so they can help you recognize when they're affecting your behavior
- **Practice probabilistic thinking**: Consider multiple possible explanations for others' behavior rather than jumping to conclusions
- **Develop decision-making policies**: Create rules for yourself to follow in common relationship scenarios

## Questions to Consider
- Where have I judged someone's character when their situation might have explained their behavior?
- How might I be overestimating how well others understand my feelings and needs?
- Which relationships in my life might be affected by halo or horn effects based on first impressions?
- When have I made relationship decisions in a "cold" state that I later regretted in a "hot" emotional state?
- What tribal affiliations might be influencing my judgments of others unconsciously?
- How often do I assume others have malicious intent when their actions might have innocent explanations?
- Which of my relationship conflicts might stem from the illusion of transparency rather than actual disagreements?

## Conclusion
This book is absolutely worth your time if you've ever struggled with relationships despite your best intentions. Tsipursky delivers a rare combination of solid research, practical tools, and actionable advice that can genuinely transform how you navigate personal and professional connections. The biggest strength is the focus on solutions rather than just problems—each cognitive bias comes with concrete strategies you can implement immediately.

What makes this book exceptional is its emphasis on active practice through exercises rather than passive reading. As Tsipursky repeatedly emphasizes, knowing about cognitive biases isn't enough—you need to actively practice recognizing and counteracting them in real relationship situations. The book's value comes from doing the work, not just understanding the concepts.

Read this if you're tired of repeating destructive relationship patterns, if traditional relationship advice has failed you, or if you want to understand the hidden mental processes that sabotage your best intentions. It's particularly valuable for professionals seeking better workplace relationships and anyone interested in the practical applications of behavioral psychology. The science-backed strategies offer hope that we can overcome our evolutionary programming and build the relationships we genuinely want.
