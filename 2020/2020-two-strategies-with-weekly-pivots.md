# Two Strategies with Weekly Pivots
**Authors**: Heikin Ashi Trader | **Year**: 2020

## Summary
This practical trading guide presents two systematic approaches to forex scalping using weekly pivot points as key support and resistance levels. The book emphasizes that weekly pivots are more reliable than daily pivots because they're calculated from a full week of data and are more likely to be respected by institutional traders. The strategies are designed for disciplined execution with clear entry, exit, and risk management rules.

Forex traders seeking structured, rule-based scalping strategies will benefit from the clear frameworks and risk management principles presented. The methods are particularly suitable for traders who prefer counter-trend approaches and want to capitalize on the "magnetic force" that pivot levels exert on price movements.

## Core Strategies

### Strategy 1: Trade the Pivot
This counter-trend strategy capitalizes on the tendency of prices to bounce off weekly pivot levels on first contact. The approach places limit orders directly at pivot levels, anticipating a 15-pip reversal move. The strategy uses bracket orders with a 1:1 risk-reward ratio (15 pips profit target, 15 pips stop loss) and requires strict discipline to only trade the first touch of each pivot level.

**Key Implementation:**
- Place buy/sell limit orders at pivot, support, or resistance levels
- Set automatic take profit at 15 pips and stop loss at 15 pips
- Only trade the first touch of each pivot level per session
- Avoid trading when pivot levels are too close together (minimum 60-pip range)

> "In three of the four cases in Figure 1, the market reached the pivot level almost exactly, whereupon the market turned in the other direction. We want to take advantage of this fact in this strategy, by placing limit orders at the pivot levels and speculating on a countermove of 15 pips."

**Quick Win**: Focus on currency pairs with wider pivot ranges (60+ pips between levels) to provide adequate room for price targets and reduce cluster risk.

### Strategy 2: The "Last 20 Pips" Strategy
This momentum strategy assumes that when price approaches within 20 pips of a weekly pivot level, it will likely reach that target due to the "magnetic force" pivot levels exert on market participants. The strategy enters trades when price is 20 pips away from a pivot level and targets the pivot itself with a 20-pip profit objective.

**Key Implementation:**
- Enter when price is 20 pips away from weekly pivot/support/resistance levels
- Place take profit at the pivot level (20 pips away)
- Set stop loss 20 pips below entry point for 1:1 risk-reward ratio
- Avoid low-volatility pairs where 20-pip targets are unrealistic

> "When the market approaches one of the weekly pivots, it will usually reach it. This means that momentum traders will drive the pair towards the weekly pivot once it is only a few pips away from it. In this sense, the last 20 pips strategy is a momentum strategy."

**Quick Win**: Adjust profit targets based on market volatility - use 15 pips for less volatile conditions and stick to 20 pips for normal markets.

## Risk Management Framework

### Position Sizing & Market Selection
- Only trade currency pairs with minimum 60-pip ranges between pivot levels
- Avoid low-volatility pairs like AUDUSD/NZDUSD during quiet periods
- Be flexible with profit targets (15-20 pips) based on market conditions
- Diversify across different strategies rather than similar strategies across many pairs

### Drawdown Management
Never change strategy parameters during drawdown periods. The author emphasizes that modifying parameters when experiencing losses typically indicates amateur behavior and distorts statistical tracking. Instead, maintain discipline through drawdown periods and only abandon a strategy after extended unprofitability.

> "Professionals don't get nervous because they have had some losses in a particular currency pair for two or three weeks."

## Best Quotes
- "Pivot points, or simply 'pivots', were originally developed by floor traders in the commodity markets, in order to determine potential turning points."
- "The more currency pairs you trade with a similar strategy, the bigger the so-called cluster risk becomes."
- "Forex trading is like any other form of trading – it is hard work. Only those who execute their strategy(ies) in a disciplined manner have a chance of being successful."
- "Patience pays off. As you can see in Figure 5, sometimes a currency pair does not do so well for two weeks. But that does not mean that the strategy does not work in the long run."

## Action Items
- Set up weekly pivot indicators on your trading platform for multiple currency pairs
- Practice identifying viable pivot ranges (minimum 60 pips between levels)
- Create bracket order templates for 15-pip and 20-pip strategies
- Develop a journal to track first-touch effectiveness for each currency pair
- Establish maximum weekly loss limits to prevent overtrading during drawdowns

## Questions to Consider
- Which currency pairs historically show the most respect for weekly pivot levels?
- How will you handle weeks when pivot levels are too close together for profitable trading?
- What's your plan if multiple currency pairs experience simultaneous losses due to dollar correlation?
- How will you maintain discipline when tempted to modify parameters during drawdowns?
- Will you trade these strategies exclusively or incorporate them into a diversified approach?

## Conclusion
This book delivers exactly what it promises - two clear, actionable forex scalping strategies with specific entry, exit, and risk management rules. The emphasis on weekly pivots rather than daily pivots provides a solid foundation based on institutional market behavior. While the backtested results show realistic profitability (averaging 3-5 pips per trade across multiple pairs), success ultimately depends on trader discipline and proper market selection.

The strategies are worth your time if you're a structured trader who values systematic approaches and can maintain emotional discipline through the inevitable losing periods. The biggest reason to read this book is to learn how to capitalize on the reliable behavior of market participants around pivot levels while implementing professional-grade risk management practices.
