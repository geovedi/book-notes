# Hood Feminism
**Author**: Mikki Kendall | **Year**: 2020
**Category**: Philosophy & Critical Thinking

## Summary
Hood Feminism is a powerful critique of mainstream feminism's failure to address the basic survival needs of marginalized women. Kendall argues that feminism has become too focused on the concerns of already-privileged white women—issues like workplace advancement and body positivity—while ignoring fundamental issues like food insecurity, gun violence, inadequate healthcare, and educational inequality that affect millions of women daily.

The book introduces "hood feminism" as an approach rooted in community awareness and the recognition that everything affecting women's lives is a feminist issue. Kendall demonstrates through personal stories, statistics, and analysis how mainstream feminism often centers on "increasing privilege" rather than addressing basic survival needs. This is essential reading for anyone who wants to understand why so many women of color feel alienated from modern feminist movements and what a truly inclusive feminism would look like.

## Core Insights

### The Failure of Mainstream Feminism
Mainstream feminism has consistently centered the needs of privileged white women while treating issues affecting marginalized women as peripheral concerns. As Kendall notes, "the problems facing marginalized women have only increased in intensity, somehow food insecurity, education, and health care—beyond the most basic of reproductive needs—are rarely touted as feminist issues."

The book reveals how mainstream feminism often asks women of color to wait their turn for equality, operating under the assumption that once white women achieve parity with white men, benefits will eventually trickle down to others. This approach ignores how race, class, and gender intersect to create unique challenges for women who face multiple forms of marginalization simultaneously.

> "There's nothing feminist about having so many resources at your fingertips and choosing to be ignorant. Nothing empowering or enlightening in deciding that intent trumps impact."

**Quick Take**: True feminism must recognize that different women face different obstacles and require different solutions. One-size-fits-all approaches inevitably leave the most vulnerable behind.

### Everything That Affects Women Is a Feminist Issue
Kendall argues forcefully that basic survival needs—food security, safe neighborhoods, quality education, healthcare access, and living wages—are fundamental feminist concerns. She notes that while mainstream feminism debates workplace advancement and body hair, women in marginalized communities are struggling to feed their families and avoid gun violence.

The book demonstrates how issues like hunger disproportionately affect women and children, with approximately 66% of American households struggling with hunger being headed by single mothers. Similarly, gun violence is not just a "men's issue" but deeply impacts women's safety and freedom, with Black women experiencing the highest rates of gun homicide of any group of women.

> "Feminism in the hood is for everyone, because everyone needs it."

**Quick Take**: A feminism that ignores basic survival needs cannot achieve true equality for all women.

### The Strong Black Woman Myth as Oppression
Kendall unpacks how the myth of the "Strong Black Woman" has been weaponized to justify ignoring the needs and suffering of Black women. This stereotype suggests that Black women are inherently tougher and more resilient than white women, making their need for care or concern less pressing.

This myth allows mainstream feminism to prioritize the comfort and advancement of white women while expecting Black women to endure additional burdens without complaint. It also intersects with racist historical stereotypes that have long been used to justify the exploitation and dehumanization of Black women's bodies and labor.

> "The myth of the Strong Black Woman has made it so that white women can tell themselves that it is okay to expect us to wait to be equal with them, because they need it more."

**Quick Take**: The expectation that marginalized women must endure more suffering than privileged women is itself a form of oppression that feminism must actively combat.

### Reproductive Justice Beyond Abortion Rights
While supporting abortion rights, Kendall argues that reproductive justice must encompass the full spectrum of healthcare access and address racial disparities in maternal mortality. She points out that Black mothers die at 3-4 times the rate of white mothers in America, and even wealth and fame don't protect Black women from medical discrimination.

The book highlights how Serena Williams, one of the most famous and wealthy athletes in the world, nearly died after giving birth because medical staff dismissed her concerns about her own health. This demonstrates that medical racism and sexism affect Black women across all socioeconomic levels.

> "Reproductive justice must include trans healthcare, disability rights, and access to comprehensive healthcare."

**Quick Take**: True reproductive justice requires addressing what happens after birth—including support for children with disabilities and resources for parents—rather than focusing solely on abortion access.

## Best Quotes
- "There's nothing feminist about having so many resources at your fingertips and choosing to be ignorant. Nothing empowering or enlightening in deciding that intent trumps impact. Especially when the consequences aren't going to be experienced by you, but will instead be experienced by someone from a marginalized community."

- "This book is about the health of the community as a whole, with a specific focus on supporting the most vulnerable members. It will focus largely on the experiences of the marginalized, and address the issues faced by most women, instead of the issues that only concern a few."

- "The myth of the Strong Black Woman has made it so that white women can tell themselves that it is okay to expect us to wait to be equal with them, because they need it more. The fact that Black women are supposedly tougher than white women means that we are built to face abuse and ignorance, and that our need for care or concern is less pressing."

- "Intersectionality isn't a convenient buzzword that can be co-opted into erasing Professor Kimberlé Williams Crenshaw, who coined the term to describe the way race and gender impact Black women in the justice system."

- "Feminism cannot be about pitying women who didn't have access to the right schools or the same opportunities, or making them projects to be studied, or requiring them to be more respectable in order for them to be full participants in the movement."

## Action Items
- **Practice Active Solidarity**: Instead of assuming you understand what marginalized women need, listen to their experiences and follow their leadership on issues that affect them.
- **Support Basic Needs Programs**: Advocate for policies addressing food insecurity, housing instability, educational inequality, and healthcare access as core feminist issues.

- **Educate Yourself on Maternal Mortality Disparities**: Learn about and advocate against the racial disparities in maternal healthcare that put Black women at significantly higher risk.

Hood Feminism is a wake-up call for a movement that has lost its way. Kendall's powerful critique demonstrates how mainstream feminism has become increasingly focused on the concerns of already-privileged women while ignoring fundamental survival issues affecting millions daily. The book makes a compelling case that feminism cannot achieve true equality until it centers the needs of the most vulnerable and addresses issues like food insecurity, gun violence, educational inequality, and healthcare access as core feminist concerns.
