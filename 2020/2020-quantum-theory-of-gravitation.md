# Quantum Theory of Gravitation
**Authors**: Ustin Chashchikhin | **Year**: 2020
**Category**: Science & Nature

## Summary
This revolutionary physics book presents a groundbreaking approach to quantum gravity that challenges the century-old graviton hypothesis. Chashchikhin derives equations of quantum gravitation containing all three fundamental constants (G, c, and h) and proposes that gravitational fields are not quantized but remain continuous spacetime curvature even at quantum levels. The book solves the singularity problem in general relativity by establishing maximal density limits for quantum matter (~10^27 kg/m³) and maximal spacetime curvature (~10² m⁻²), preventing infinite collapse in black holes. Most radically, the theory predicts that the Big Bang was not a creation event but the inevitable result of a previous universe's Big Crunch through quantum gravitational collapse.

Physicists, cosmologists, and students of theoretical physics will gain a radical new perspective on quantum gravity that resolves longstanding paradoxes in both general relativity and quantum mechanics while supporting scientific atheism through physical necessity rather than philosophical choice.

## Core Insights

### The Graviton Does Not Exist
Chashchikhin demonstrates that unlike the elementary electric charge that quantizes electromagnetic fields, there is no elementary mass, energy, or momentum in nature. Without these minimal values, nothing can emit the hypothetical graviton particle.

> "No charge quantum—no field quantum. No minimal energy quantum—no graviton."
> _Original: "No charge quantum—no field quantum. No minimal energy quantum—no graviton."_

**Quick Take**: Gravitational interaction isn't particle exchange but purely geometric spacetime curvature.

### Three Quantum Solutions to Gravitational Collapse
The author presents three independent quantum mechanical principles that prevent singularity formation:

1. **Pauli Exclusion Principle**: Fermions (quarks and leptons) cannot occupy identical quantum states, creating maximum density limits
2. **Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle**: As particles localize, their momentum/energy increases, converting gravitational energy into heat rather than singularity formation
3. **QED Localization Limits**: Particles cannot be confined within volumes smaller than their Compton wavelength, regardless of external forces

> "In a quantum gravitational collapse, the energy of a collapsing star is spent on increasing its temperature, and not on the formation of a singularity."
> _Original: "In a quantum gravitational collapse, the energy of a collapsing star is spent on increasing its temperature, and not on the formation of a singularity."_

**Quick Take**: Black holes contain ultrarelativistic t-quark matter at maximum density, not infinite singularities.

### Continuous Translational Energy Defies Graviton Theory
The book proves that free electrons and photons have continuous energy spectra, not discrete quantized values. Since gravitational fields depend on the energy-momentum tensor in general relativity, continuous energy spectra mean continuous gravitational field spectra.

> "Since the translational energy spectrum of a free electron is really continuous, this means that the gravitational field also has a continuous spectrum and existence of a graviton is physically impossible."
> _Original: "Since the translational energy spectrum of a free electron is really continuous, this means that the gravitational field also has a continuous spectrum and existence of a graviton is physically impossible."_

**Quick Take**: Without discrete energy levels, gravitational fields cannot be particle-based.

### Quantum Black Holes and Maximum Density
Chashchikhin calculates that black hole cores consist of ultrarelativistic t-quark matter at maximum density of ~10^27 kg/m³—about a billion times nuclear density. This creates finite spacetime curvature (~20 m⁻²) instead of infinite singularities.

> "Inner areas of black holes consist of ttt-baryons of this maximal density, but there is no singularity!"
> _Original: "Inner areas of black holes consist of ttt-baryons of this maximal density, but there is no singularity!"_

**Quick Take**: Black holes are "t-quark stars" with finite, not infinite, properties.

### Big Bang from Big Crunch
The theory predicts that the Big Bang was not creation but the inevitable result of quantum gravitational collapse following a previous universe's Big Crunch. Energy conservation means matter always existed.

> "The big bang is a purely quantum gravitational phenomenon predicted by my quantum theory of gravitation."
> _Original: "The big bang is a purely quantum gravitational phenomenon predicted by my quantum theory of gravitation."_

**Quick Take**: Universe operates in eternal cycles, eliminating need for creation events or divine intervention.

## Action Items
- Look for experimental verification of continuous electron energy spectra
- Search for ttt-baryons at high-energy colliders
- Develop experiments to measure maximum quantum density limits
- Test predictions about gravitational field behavior at quantum scales

## Questions to Consider
- If gravitons don't exist, how do we explain gravitational waves detected by LIGO?
- Can the maximum density prediction be tested through astronomical observations?
- How does this theory reconcile with successful predictions of quantum field theory?
- What experimental evidence would definitively prove or disprove this approach?

## Conclusion
Is this revolutionary book worth your time? Absolutely if you're interested in fundamental physics. Chashchikhin presents a mathematically coherent and physically plausible alternative to graviton-based quantum gravity theories that have failed for a century. His approach elegantly resolves the singularity problem, predicts observable phenomena, and eliminates the need for "creation" events in cosmology.

The biggest reason to read this book is its radical simplicity: by returning to fundamental quantum principles rather than complex mathematical constructions, Chashchikhin may have solved one of physics' greatest mysteries. Even if ultimately proven wrong, this book provides essential critical thinking about accepted dogmas in theoretical physics and demonstrates how questioning fundamental assumptions can lead to profound insights.
