**Authors**: George Saoulidis | **Year**: 2020
**Category**: Business & Finance

## Summary
This practical guide reveals how to create a new product every single day by adopting a creator mindset focused on building multiple income streams through intellectual property ownership. The author presents a system where entrepreneurs can leverage their existing content and skills to generate diverse products across different formats and platforms. The core philosophy emphasizes viewing everything as a product, from blog posts and merchandise to translations and multimedia adaptations, with the goal of creating sustainable passive income through volume and variety.

This book is perfect for multi-skilled creators, entrepreneurs, and content producers who want to build multiple revenue streams without getting stuck in analysis paralysis. Readers will learn practical strategies for maximizing the value of their intellectual property and creating efficient production workflows that generate consistent output.

## Core Product Creation Framework

### The Creator Mindset
Transform your thinking from employee to entrepreneur by understanding that anything can make you money. The book defines a product as "anything that can make you money" - from a monetized blog post to a mug printed with your artwork. This mental shift is crucial for seeing opportunities everywhere and building multiple income streams that compound over time.

> "My definition of a product is very wide. Anything that can make you money is a product. A blog post on a monetized blog is a product. A book made out of those same blog posts is a product. A piece of music is a product."
**Quick Take**: Start viewing your creative output through a business lens - every piece of content you create has potential to become multiple products.

### Intellectual Property Ownership Strategy
Own everything you create. International law gives you ownership of everything you make, making IP creation the most accessible path to product generation. The alternative is buying or licensing rights from creators, but this should be done ethically with clear terms, time limits (7+ years minimum), and fair compensation.

> "After you own a widget, some piece of IP, you're gonna start figuring out ways of making products out of it."
**Quick Take**: Focus on creating your own IP rather than licensing others' work - it's cheaper, builds your brand faster, and gives you complete control.

### The Product Multiplication System
Once you have one product, you can create dozens more by repurposing across formats and media types. A single piece of content can become blog posts, books, audiobooks, videos, merchandise, and microcontent. The author demonstrates how one artwork licensing deal generated almost 50 different products across multiple formats.

> "Even if I explain everything to you, you need to learn how to figure those things out for yourself. Google is your friend."
**Quick Take**: Map out every possible format your content could take and systematically create products for each distribution channel.

### The Pareto Principle Production Method
Focus your energy on the 20% of activities that generate 80% of results. Instead of handling manufacturing yourself, partner with specialized services (like Zazzle for merchandise or ACX for audiobooks) and share revenue. This allows you to focus on creation rather than logistics while maintaining ownership.

> "The Pareto rule of 80/20 is your friend. I could, theoretically, figure out how to buy bulk t-shirts, print my art on them at a printer, sell them and deliver them to people. That's the 80% of work. Or, I could just leave all that to a specialised company."
**Quick Take**: Partner with specialists and share revenue rather than trying to handle every aspect of production yourself.

### Daily Production Quota System
Create the equivalent of one product every day, understanding this doesn't mean literal daily creation. Sometimes you'll batch work and publish multiple products at once. The key is maintaining a consistent output rate of approximately 30 products per month, building an extensive catalog over time.

> "Making one product every day doesn't mean that you actually make one every day, only the equivalent of one."
**Quick Take**: Track your product creation as a monthly quota rather than forcing daily output - batch when inspiration strikes but maintain consistent volume.

## Best Quotes

- "Everything, literally everything non-natural, was made by someone. Why not be that someone that makes things?"
- "Dare to be bad, keep making new products and some will turn out good."
- "You can't possibly not have something worthwhile if you're pumping out the volume of products I'm talking about in here. It cannot all suck."
