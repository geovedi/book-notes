# Growing Marijuana and DIY Cannabis Extracts Collection
**Authors**: Saul Silver | **Year**: 2020

## Summary
This comprehensive collection serves as both a cultivation guide and extract preparation manual for cannabis enthusiasts. The book is divided into two main sections: first covering indoor and outdoor marijuana growing techniques from beginner to expert level, then providing detailed instructions for creating various cannabis extracts and infused edibles. The author positions this as a complete resource for anyone looking to grow their own cannabis plants and transform them into therapeutic extracts, concentrates, and culinary creations.

Perfect for medical marijuana patients, home cultivation enthusiasts, and anyone interested in cannabis extract preparation who wants practical, step-by-step guidance from seed to finished product.

## Core Insights

### Indoor Growing Fundamentals
The key to successful indoor cannabis cultivation is emulating natural conditions indoors. Since marijuana isn't naturally designed for indoor growing, you must "fool" plants into thinking they're outdoors by carefully controlling light, temperature, humidity, and ventilation. The most critical factor is light - more light directly equals more bud, regardless of plant count. High Intensity Discharge (HID) lamps are essential: metal halide for vegetative growth and high pressure sodium for flowering.

> "Plants are not particularly designed to develop indoors. However, due to Marijuana being an extremely controlled substance, and growing it is deemed illegal in most states, growing it indoors away from prying eyes is almost always necessary."
**Quick Take**: Invest in proper lighting first - a 1000-watt HID system can produce up to one pound of dried cannabis per 3-4 month cycle.

### Plant Lifecycle Management
Cannabis follows distinct stages: seedling (2-3 weeks), vegetative (2-8 weeks), and flowering (7-8 weeks for indicas, longer for sativas). During vegetative growth, plants need 18 hours of light daily; flowering requires 12 hours light/12 hours dark to trigger budding. The critical decision is vegetation length - shorter cycles mean more frequent harvests of smaller plants, while longer cycles yield larger plants but take more time.

> "During this time, flowers become dense and form cola buds at the tops of branches. Sticky resins high in THC begin to coat the surface of leaves."
**Quick Take**: Switch to flowering when plants reach two-thirds of your desired final size, as they'll continue growing during flowering.

### Sex Determination and Cloning
Only female plants produce the coveted THC-rich buds, making male identification and removal crucial. Male plants develop pollen sacs while females show white hairs. Serious growers eliminate guesswork by using female clones - identical genetic copies taken from known female mother plants. Clones should be taken during vegetative stage, rooted with rooting hormone, and kept in high humidity until established.

> "Because well developed male plants use up valuable time and grow space, serious growers prefer to eliminate the problem altogether by using female clones."
**Quick Take**: Take clones before flowering, then force one clone to flower to confirm the parent plant's sex before committing to the main crop.

### Cannabis Extract Benefits and Medical Applications
Cannabis extracts offer therapeutic benefits for over 100 medical conditions, including anxiety, chronic pain, insomnia, migraines, arthritis, and epilepsy. The natural compounds THC and CBD work synergistically to reduce stress symptoms, relieve pain, balance hormones, improve sleep quality, and control epileptic seizures. Extracts provide medical benefits without the respiratory risks associated with smoking.

> "According to studies, marijuana extracts can help cure over a hundred medical conditions including anxiety, pain, stress, insomnia, migraines, arthritis, ADD, ADHD, bipolar disorder, anorexia, cancer, Parkinson's disease, hepatitis C, and loss of libido."
**Quick Take**: For medical use without psychoactive effects, choose high-CBD strains like Charlotte's Web or Harlequin; for recreational use, opt for high-THC varieties.

### Extract Preparation Techniques
The book covers multiple extraction methods including hash making, dabs (BHO), cannabutter, and cannabis oil. Hash is created by collecting trichomes through sieving, then pressing the powder into bricks. Dabs use solvents to extract concentrated THC, resulting in potent oils. Cannabutter forms the foundation for most edibles and is made by simmering cannabis material in butter and water, then straining and separating the butter.

> "Hash or hashish is the concentrated form of cannabis. It is a resin that's made from the flowers of the hemp plant. The main active substance in this resin is called tetrahydrocannabidoil or THC."
**Quick Take**: Start with cannabutter for versatility - it's the safest extraction method and works in virtually any recipe that calls for butter.

## Best Quotes

- "Growing Marijuana outdoors is just like growing any other plant outdoors. You just plant a seed in soil and let nature take its course."
- "The amount of light a plant receives each day is called the photoperiod. During seedling and vegetative growth, the plants will be given eighteen hours of light and six hours of darkness."
- "Crop potential is determined, foremost, by the amount of light that is used. Common household incandescent and halogen lamps are inappropriate for plants."
- "Cannabis oil and other extracts help relieve stress and anxiety. The natural compounds found in hemp (THC and CBD) can reduce the common effects of stress such as chest pain, fatigue, headache, muscle pain, upset stomach, sleep problems, restlessness, irritability, overeating, and social anxiety."
- "Always handle cannabutter and other cannabis-infused cooking items with care. If you feel that the amount of cannabis-infused food item in the recipe is too much for you, feel free to adjust it."

## Action Items

- Set up a dedicated grow space with proper reflective materials, ventilation, and light-proofing
- Invest in quality HID lighting systems: metal halide for vegetative growth, high pressure sodium for flowering
- Implement a 18/6 light cycle during vegetation, switching to 12/12 for flowering
- Learn plant sexing and remove males immediately to prevent pollination and seed production
- Create a cloning system using rooting hormone and humidity domes for consistent female genetics
- Start extract preparation with basic cannabutter before advancing to more complex concentrates
- Choose appropriate cannabis strains based on intended use: high-CBD for medical, high-THC for recreational
- Practice proper dosing and start with small amounts when consuming edibles or extracts

## Questions to Consider

- What's your primary goal: personal medical use, recreational consumption, or commercial production?
- Do you have adequate space, electrical capacity, and ventilation for indoor growing?
- Are you prepared for the legal and safety considerations of cannabis cultivation and extract making?
- How much time can you commit to daily plant maintenance and monitoring?
- What extraction methods best suit your experience level and available equipment?
- Are you growing for specific medical conditions that would benefit from particular cannabinoid profiles?

## Conclusion

This collection delivers substantial practical value for anyone serious about home cannabis cultivation and extract preparation, despite some limitations in production quality. The dual focus on growing techniques and extraction methods makes it a comprehensive reference, though the information isn't particularly revolutionary compared to other cultivation guides available online.

The biggest reason to read this book is its combination of growing fundamentals with extensive extract recipes - you're essentially getting two guides in one. For medical marijuana patients or enthusiasts who want control over their entire cannabis supply chain from seed to infused product, the step-by-step instructions and strain recommendations provide a solid foundation. However, readers should supplement this with current legal information for their jurisdiction and consider additional safety resources for solvent-based extractions.

**Worth your time if**: You want complete control over cannabis cultivation and preparation, or you're a medical patient seeking self-sufficiency in your medicine production.

**Skip if**: You're looking for cutting-edge growing techniques or need only basic cultivation information without interest in extracts.
