# The Pragmatist's Guide to Sexuality
**Authors**: Malcolm Collins, Simone Collins | **Year**: 2020
**Category**: Romance & Relationships

## Summary
This book offers a data-driven, unfiltered exploration of human sexuality that challenges conventional wisdom about what turns people on and why. The authors argue that human arousal patterns are neither indicators of identity nor moral character, but rather windows into our evolutionary past and cognitive architecture. Through extensive research and surveys, they reveal that unusual sexual interests are universal, enduring throughout history, and not caused by modern phenomena like internet pornography.

Anyone curious about understanding human sexuality beyond social conventions will benefit from this book. Readers will gain a scientific framework for comprehending their own and others' arousal patterns, free from judgment or ideological bias. You'll learn why humans develop the sexual interests they do and how these patterns reveal insights about human nature and our species' development.

## Core Insights

### Sexuality Is Not Identity
The book's central thesis is that arousal patterns say nothing about a person's character, identity, or moral worth. The authors argue that society makes a fundamental error by treating sexual attractions as revelations of who someone is "deep inside."

> "Pragmatically speaking, the fact that something arouses a person neither indicates that they want that thing to happen nor necessitates that they must ideologically approve of it."

**Quick Take**: Your sexual response patterns are involuntary neurological reactions, not conscious choices or identity markers. This framework frees people from shame while acknowledging that actions, not attractions, define character.

### Everyone Has "Weird" Arousal Patterns
Through their research surveys, the authors discovered that the average person finds 22 unusual things arousing (23.1 for men, 20.8 for women). What we consider "kinks" are actually the norm rather than the exception.

> "The surveys we ran when putting this book together suggest that you, dear reader, are in fact the strange one. Apparently, the vast majority of humans find wacky, seemingly random things to be arousing."

**Quick Take**: Human sexuality is inherently varied and complex. The book provides examples throughout history—from James Joyce's letters to Victorian erotica—showing that unusual sexual interests have always existed and haven't changed with modern technology.

### The Arousal Equation Framework
The authors propose a scientific model for understanding sexuality: [Specific Stimuli] → [+1, -1, or 0] × [Volume Multiplier] = [Arousal or Gross Impulse]. This framework separates stimuli from moral judgment.

**Quick Take**: Understanding sexuality as a neurological response system helps explain why people can be aroused by things they find disgusting or morally wrong, and why arousal doesn't equal desire or consent.

### Developmental Distance Theory
One key concept is that arousal patterns are influenced by "developmental distance"—how closely related something is to our species' typical breeding conditions during our evolutionary development. This explains many seemingly random sexual interests.

**Quick Take**: Things that remind our brains of ancestral mating scenarios (even in abstract ways) can trigger arousal. This framework helps explain why seemingly unrelated stimuli become sexualized.

### Gender Differences in Arousal Patterns
The book explores significant differences between male and female arousal patterns, including women's higher likelihood of being aroused by submission scenarios and violence-adjacent content. Women search for porn featuring violence against women at more than twice the rate of men.

> "A quarter of porn searches conducted by straight women involve searches for acts that depict male violence against women like 'painful anal crying,' 'public disgrace,' 'extreme brutal gangbang,' 'forced,' and 'rape.'"

**Quick Take**: These differences reflect evolutionary pressures rather than cultural conditioning, and understanding them helps explain persistent patterns in human sexual behavior across societies.

## Best Quotes
- "If humans were not collectively brainwashed by our neurology to find the prospect of recreationally sticking penises into vaginas while making silly faces and noises to be arousing, we would find the whole process just as absurd as any so-called 'kink.'"
- "To understand what arouses someone is to merely understand which stimuli will create a positive sexual feeling in that person's brain... On a less granular scale, to understand stimuli that arouse most humans is to understand (1) how our brains work and (2) the conditions and social structures of our early ancestors."
- "Being human is something that merits at least some shame. The fact that we are burdened with stinky, sticky, goo-producing genitals is punishment enough—and yet some of us slam them together... and even put our mouths on them."

## Action Items
- Separate your arousal patterns from your identity and moral judgments
- Recognize that unusual sexual interests are normal and universal across human populations
- Use the arousal equation framework to understand your own responses without shame
- Distinguish between involuntary arousal patterns and voluntary actions/choices
- Apply evolutionary insights to better understand why certain stimuli trigger arousal

## Questions to Consider
- If arousal patterns don't reveal identity, what should we do with that information socially and legally?
- How might understanding the universal nature of "unusual" sexual interests change our approach to sexual education and social norms?
- What are the implications of separating arousal from moral judgment in areas of law and ethics?
- How can we create social structures that acknowledge the reality of human sexual variation while maintaining consent and safety?

## Conclusion
This book is absolutely worth your time if you're interested in a scientifically rigorous, ideology-free examination of human sexuality. The biggest reason to read it is that it provides a framework for understanding the full complexity of human sexual response without shame or moral confusion. The authors' data-driven approach cuts through centuries of misinformation and cultural baggage to reveal how human sexuality actually works.

What makes this book exceptional is its combination of scientific rigor, accessibility, and complete rejection of both conservative moralism and progressive identity politics around sexuality. The authors treat human sexual variation as a fascinating area of scientific inquiry rather than a battlefield for cultural wars. Whether you agree with all their conclusions or not, this book will permanently change how you think about human sexuality and provide tools for understanding your own and others' experiences.
