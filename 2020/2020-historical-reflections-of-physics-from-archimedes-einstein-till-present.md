# Historical Reflections of Physics: From Archimedes... Einstein till Present
**Original Title**: Historical reflections of Physics: From Archimedes, …, Einstein till present.
**Author**: Santo Armenia | **Year**: 2020
**Category**: Science & Nature

## Summary
This controversial physics book challenges millennia of scientific understanding by claiming that the shape of solid bodies affects their weight. The author presents what he describes as a revolutionary discovery that overturns fundamental principles established by Archimedes, Newton, and Einstein. Armenia argues that physics has been built on a "millennial mistake" - the assumption that body weight is unalterable and that gravity directions are parallel rather than radial.

The book appeals to physics enthusiasts, skeptics of established scientific consensus, and readers interested in paradigm-challenging theories. It offers a provocative reexamination of foundational physics concepts, from Archimedes' buoyancy principles to Einstein's relativity theory.

## Core Insights

### The Shape of Solid Bodies Discovery
The author's central claim is that the shape of solid bodies influences their weight, a principle he argues has been overlooked for over 2,000 years. This discovery emerged from experiments with buoyant bodies in water, where Armenia observed that bodies with similar densities change their state (floating, suspension, sinking) when their shape changes position in water.

> "In every natural phenomenon observed, in every experiment carried out, when there is a gravitational pull, the shape of solid bodies needs to be considered."
**Quick Take**: Traditional physics treats bodies as point masses, but the author argues that distance from the center of mass varies with shape and positioning, affecting gravitational effects.

### The Millennial Error
Armenia identifies a fundamental mistake originating with Archimedes - the assumption that weight is unalterable and that gravity directions are parallel. He argues this error was perpetuated through Stevin, Galileo, Newton, and continues into modern physics, despite Newton's universal gravitation law suggesting weight changes with position.

> "Since the dawn of time philosophers considered the weight of bodies unalterable."
> _Original: "Since the down of time philosophers considered the weight of bodies unalterable."_
**Quick Take**: The author claims that treating weight as constant rather than variable with position and shape has led to cumulative errors in physics theory.

### Experimental Evidence and the "Natural Scale"
Armenia presents water as a "natural scale" that reveals the effects of shape on weight. He describes experiments showing that objects can maintain infinite positions of equilibrium at different depths, contradicting established buoyancy principles from Archimedes through Galileo.

> "With the passing of time or adding salt into the water, the fresh egg goes from floating to sinking, but in the middle, it passes through every position of balance 'in reality' at every depth and not through the only position allowed by 'the theoretical model'."
**Quick Take**: Simple observations like egg floating behavior supposedly demonstrate that traditional buoyancy models are incomplete.

### Critique of Modern Physics Institutions
The book strongly criticizes contemporary scientific institutions for what the author describes as inertia and resistance to confronting new experimental evidence. He specifically challenges the 2019 redefinition of the kilogram mass for not accounting for shape effects on weight measurements.

> "The Scientific Community has to win over its inertia as soon as possible."
**Quick Take**: The author argues that scientific progress is being hindered by institutional resistance to paradigm shifts.

### Historical Contradictions
Armenia identifies what he considers crucial historical contradictions between Archimedes' original buoyancy propositions and later interpretations by Stevin and Galileo, particularly regarding bodies of equal weight to liquids.

> "Archimedes' third proposition: 'Solid bodies with the same weight of the liquid, if submerged in it, dive in without descending below the surface of the liquid nor plunging to the bottom'."
**Quick Take**: The author claims that academic textbooks misrepresent Archimedes' original principles, perpetuating centuries-old errors.

## Best Quotes
- "The love for the Pursuit of the Truth and Knowledge, regardless of 'The shape of solid bodies', has led me to new insights about buoyant bodies; hanging/rotating bodies."
- "It is with renewed love for the Pursuit of the Truth and Knowledge that I found out this effect in water, a 'natural scale', with experiments about buoyancy."
- "For the love of the Research of the Truth and Knowledge, a 'Democratic and Scientific' confrontation is needed: nobody can escape their obligations."
- "Not one. Not a hundred. But a thousand Odysseus. No Giant. With Socrates' art 'no masters nor tuteles'."
- "Two millennia have passed in vain: at present, the weight of a body is still addled for its mass, thus adding more severe mistakes."

## Action Items
- Examine buoyancy experiments with fresh attention to shape effects and equilibrium positions
- Reconsider weight measurements in light of potential shape influences
- Approach historical scientific principles with critical analysis rather than unquestioning acceptance
- Encourage scientific institutions to be more open to paradigm-challenging evidence
- Study the relationship between body shape, mass distribution, and gravitational effects

## Questions to Consider
- Could traditional physics be missing fundamental effects due to oversimplified assumptions?
- How might scientific institutions balance stability with openness to revolutionary ideas?
- What role should experimental evidence play in challenging established theoretical frameworks?
- How can we distinguish between legitimate paradigm shifts and pseudoscientific claims?
- What responsibilities do scientists have to confront institutional inertia?

## Conclusion
This book presents a radical challenge to fundamental physics principles, claiming that millennia of scientific understanding have been built on flawed assumptions about weight and shape. While the author's experimental claims are provocative and the historical analysis is detailed, the theories presented remain highly controversial and outside mainstream scientific consensus.

The book is worth reading for those interested in the philosophy of science, the history of physics, and paradigm-challenging ideas, even if readers ultimately disagree with the author's conclusions. It serves as a reminder that even the most established scientific principles should remain open to questioning and experimental verification. The biggest reason to engage with this work is to exercise critical thinking about the foundations of scientific knowledge and the processes by which scientific consensus evolves.
