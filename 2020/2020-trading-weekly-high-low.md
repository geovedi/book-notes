**Authors**: Heikin Ashi Trader | **Year**: 2020

## Summary
This practical guide reveals two powerful forex trading strategies that leverage the magnetic attraction of previous weekly highs and lows. The book demonstrates how these significant price levels act as psychological barriers that attract market attention, creating predictable trading opportunities when prices approach these zones.

Written for intermediate forex traders seeking systematic approaches, this book provides concrete entry and exit rules with a 1:1 risk-reward ratio. The author shows through real examples how traders can gain a small but consistent edge by exploiting the natural tendency of markets to either be drawn toward weekly levels or temporarily overshoot them before reversing.

## Core Insights

### The Magnetic Power of Weekly Levels
Weekly highs and lows represent the extreme prices traders were willing to pay during the previous week, making them psychologically significant levels that attract market attention. When price approaches these levels again, traders automatically question whether the market will turn at the same point or break through, creating predictable momentum patterns.

> "After all, the high of the previous week means that this was the highest price that traders were willing to pay for a particular currency pair."

**Quick Take**: These levels act like magnets, drawing price toward them and creating trading opportunities with higher probability outcomes than random entries.

### Strategy 1: Chase the Weekly High and Low
This strategy capitalizes on the magnetic attraction of weekly levels. Place pending orders 15-20 pips away from the previous week's high or low, betting that price will be drawn toward these levels rather than move away. Use a 1:1 risk-reward ratio with 15 pips profit target and 15 pips stop loss.

> "The 'Chase the weekly high and low strategy' assumes that there is a higher probability that the market will move towards this level rather than in the opposite direction."

**Quick Take**: Works best when price is at least 40-50 pips away from the weekly level to ensure sufficient momentum potential.

### Strategy 2: Weekly High and Low Stretch
This approach exploits the tendency of markets to overshoot weekly levels temporarily before reversing. Enter trades when price first touches the previous week's high or low, betting on a 15-pip continuation beyond the level before reversal. Institutional orders at these levels create the temporary overshoot effect.

> "My research and tests have shown that Forex markets like to stage 'a slight exaggeration' when reaching these levels."

**Quick Take**: Only trade the first touch of a weekly level - subsequent attempts have lower probability of success.

### Realistic Expectations and Results
Over a 4-month period combining both strategies across USDJPY and USDCAD, the approach generated 165 pips profit from 33 trades (22 wins, 11 losses). While not providing daily signals, the strategies offer a systematic edge when combined with other approaches.

> "Forex trading is a business, just like any other, and it must therefore be treated and seen as such. It is a well-known fact that 'losses' in trading should be seen as nothing more than 'costs'."

**Quick Take**: Success requires applying strategies to multiple currency pairs and combining them with other systematic approaches for consistent results.

## Best Quotes
- "Forex trading is nothing more than gaining a small advantage, which we call an edge. For Forex traders, it is therefore important that one scenario or another, which has a higher probability than its opposite number, will arise."
- "Such an event is quite significant. It can mean the beginning of a new trend or the continuation of an existing one. No wonder, then, that these price levels attract the attention of market participants."
- "I cannot stress enough, that a trader should always look at the markets with an open mind. Even if he has successfully executed certain strategies over a long period of time, the day may well come, when this is suddenly no longer the case."

## Action Items
- Monitor weekly highs and lows for major currency pairs each Monday
- Set bracket orders 15-20 pips away from weekly levels for the Chase strategy
- Watch for first-touch opportunities to implement the Stretch strategy
- Maintain 1:1 risk-reward ratio with 15-pip targets and stops
- Combine with other strategies to increase signal frequency
- Use multiple broker accounts for risk management and diversification

## Questions to Consider
- Which currency pairs show the strongest reactions to weekly levels in your experience?
- How can you optimize the entry distance from weekly levels for different market conditions?
- What additional filters could improve the probability of successful trades?
- How will you manage positions when markets gap over weekly levels on Sunday opens?
- What combination of strategies provides the best balance of signal frequency and win rate?

## Conclusion
This book offers two systematic, probability-based strategies that exploit well-documented market behaviors around weekly price levels. While not providing abundant trading signals, the approaches offer a genuine statistical edge when applied consistently across multiple currency pairs. The straightforward entry and exit rules make these strategies accessible to intermediate traders, while the emphasis on realistic expectations and risk management provides valuable perspective.

The book's greatest value lies in its practical demonstrations of how small statistical advantages can compound into meaningful returns over time. For traders seeking systematic approaches that don't require complex analysis or subjective judgment, these weekly level strategies provide a solid foundation for a trading business built on mathematical probability rather than prediction.
