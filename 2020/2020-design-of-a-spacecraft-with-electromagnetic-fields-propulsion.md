## Conclusion

While extremely brief, this paper introduces a potentially revolutionary approach to spacecraft propulsion that leverages natural electromagnetic fields rather than consumable fuels. The concept of achieving 0.05g acceleration through electromagnetic field interaction could fundamentally transform space exploration if technically feasible.

The biggest value lies in its potential to overcome the fuel mass limitations that currently constrain space mission design. However, readers should note that this appears to be a conceptual proposal rather than a fully developed system - the paper serves more as an introduction to a promising idea than as a complete engineering solution.
