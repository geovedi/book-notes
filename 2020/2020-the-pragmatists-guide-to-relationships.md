**Authors**: Malcolm Collins, Simone Collins | **Year**: 2020
**Category**: Romance & Relationships

## Summary
This book applies ruthless optimization and systems thinking to dating, sex, and marriage. The Collins argue that relationships are marketplaces where we are all products, and that understanding this marketplace dynamics is crucial for relationship success. They challenge readers to abandon romantic notions and instead approach relationships with the same strategic thinking they'd apply to their careers.

The book is perfect for analytical thinkers who want to systematically improve their dating life, people tired of failed relationships, and anyone who believes relationships should be approached with logic rather than pure emotion. Readers will learn to understand relationship market dynamics, identify different attraction strategies, and design custom relationship contracts that actually work in modern life.

## Core Insights

### The Relationship Marketplace
**All relationships operate as marketplaces where people are products with measurable desirability.** Just like in job markets, value fluctuates based on supply and demand, individual preferences, and timing. The authors identify two key types of desirability: Aggregate Desirability (what the average person wants) and Individual Desirability (what a specific person wants). Understanding where you fit on these scales helps you strategize effectively.

> "People hate thinking systematically about how to optimize their relationships. It is normal to hear someone say: 'I will just wait for something to happen naturally' when talking about one of the most important aspects of their life."

**Quick Take**: Your relationship value isn't fixed—it changes based on market conditions, your development, and how you position yourself. Know your market value and play to your strengths.

### Relationship Lures: The Six Strategies of Attraction
The book categorizes all attraction approaches into six "lures," each with specific mechanics and outcomes:

**The Dominance Lure**: Traditional approach using power displays to attract those seeking surrender. Works well for casual sex but creates exhausting, low-quality long-term relationships. Common in pickup artist communities.

**The Nice Lure**: Offering submission and accommodation hoping for sex/relationships in return. Almost completely ineffective because it signals low value and desperation rather than genuine kindness.

**The Sexual Exploration Lure**: Offering novel sexual experiences. Most effective for adults in kink/swinger communities and often surprisingly leads to strong long-term relationships due to clear communication and maturity.

**The Easy Lure**: Offering readily available sex with low emotional investment. Can secure short-term partners but rarely leads to quality relationships because it attracts people seeking minimal effort connections.

**The Love Lure**: The most ineffective strategy—offering your love as if it's valuable to others. The authors bluntly state that loving someone doesn't make you valuable to them; it's just your own emotion.

**The Sneaky Lure**: Hiding sexual intentions to avoid rejection, often leading to "friend zone" situations. Common among adolescents who fear direct rejection.

> "Thinking that someone will want to be with you because 'you love them' is like thinking that someone will want to be with you because you masturbate while looking at a picture of them."

**Quick Take**: Most people instinctively use terrible attraction strategies. The most effective approaches (Sexual Exploration, properly executed Dominance) require conscious effort and community involvement.

### Relationship Contracts: The Hidden Rules
**Every relationship operates under explicit or implicit contracts.** Most people use outdated "societal template contracts" that were designed centuries ago, before birth control, women's careers, and modern technology. These templates cause constant conflict because partners assume different rules without discussing them.

Key contract elements that MUST be clarified:
- **Infidelity definitions**: What counts as cheating? (Studies show wide variations—10% of Americans think watching porn is cheating)
- **Cost sharing**: Who pays for what, and what are gift limits?
- **Transparency policy**: When do partners need to share information or location?

> "There is no such thing as a relationship without a contract. All relationships are governed by contracts, be they implied or explicit."

**Quick Take**: Default relationship contracts are disasters waiting to happen. Successful couples explicitly negotiate their terms, especially for marriage where legal consequences apply.

### The Four Core Markets
Different relationship types function as separate marketplaces with different value calculations:

1. **The Sex Market**: Short-term physical encounters
2. **The Dating Market**: Casual relationships and getting to know people
3. **The Long-Term Relationship Market**: Marriage and committed partnerships
4. **The Non-Monogamy Market**: Open relationships and alternative arrangements

**Critical insight**: Skills and value don't transfer between markets. Being successful in one (like casual sex) doesn't guarantee success in others (like marriage). Women typically have advantages in short-term markets, while men often have advantages in long-term markets.

**Quick Take**: Know which market you're targeting and optimize for that specific market's rules and value calculations.

## Best Quotes
- "People pay tens of thousands of dollars to receive degrees in computer science, marketing, and neuroscience. We will happily argue that your sexual and relationship skills matter more than your career skills."
- "Dominance is literally more likely to be 'very arousing' to the average female than naked men or penises."
- "A great romantic relationship will even positively impact your health and increase your lifespan."
- "If you want to be wealthy, the fastest way to become so is to marry rich."

## Action Items
- **Assess your market value**: Honestly evaluate your attractiveness, resources, and personality in relationship markets
- **Choose your lure strategy**: Pick one effective attraction approach instead of mixing multiple ineffective ones
- **Draft explicit relationship contracts**: Clarify infidelity, finances, and transparency early in any relationship
- **Target the right market**: Focus your efforts on either sex, dating, or long-term relationship markets based on your goals
- **Avoid impossible promises**: Never contract to "always love someone" since emotions can't be controlled

## Questions to Consider
- Which relationship market should you prioritize based on your age, goals, and current life stage?
- What outdated societal contract assumptions are you making in your current or future relationships?
- If you're using the Nice or Love Lures, what would happen if you switched to a more effective strategy?
- What specific contract terms need clarification with your current or prospective partners?
- Are you building assets that increase your relationship market value over time?

## Conclusion
This book is absolutely worth your time if you're tired of relationship failures and want to approach dating with the same systematic thinking that works in other areas of life. The biggest reason to read it is that it will fundamentally change how you view relationships—from mysterious emotional phenomena to understandable systems that can be optimized.

The brutal honesty may offend romantic sensibilities, but the practical advice works. While some may find the marketplace metaphor dehumanizing, understanding these dynamics provides crucial clarity for anyone serious about relationship success. The book's greatest strength is its emphasis on explicit communication and custom contracts rather than relying on dangerous assumptions.

**Read this if**: You're analytical, tired of failed relationships, or willing to challenge romantic notions for practical results. **Skip this if**: You prefer to believe relationships should be purely magical and mysterious.
