# We Want Our Netherlands Back
**Original Title**: Wij willen ons Nederland terug
**Author**: Willem Klaassen | **Year**: 2020
**Category**: Philosophy & Critical Thinking

## Summary
This book is a provocative political critique targeting Dutch citizens frustrated with immigration policies, multiculturalism, and what the author perceives as the erosion of traditional Dutch values. Written from a right-wing populist perspective, it collects everyday frustrations and grievances about Islam, immigration, and the perceived failure of mainstream political parties to address these concerns.

The book serves as both a polemic against immigration policies and a call to action for those who feel left behind by progressive politics. It appeals specifically to non-voters, those who feel economically disadvantaged, and citizens seeking "structural changes" to reverse what they see as the decline of Dutch society.

## Core Insights

### The Islamic Immigration Crisis
The author argues that Islamic immigration poses an existential threat to Dutch culture and social stability. He claims that mass immigration, particularly from Muslim countries, has overwhelmed social services, strained the housing market, and created unsafe living conditions for native Dutch citizens. The book presents Islam not as a religion but as an aggressive political ideology incompatible with Dutch values.

> "If you choose left, you get Islam for free."
> _Original: "als je kiest voor links, krijg je de islam er gratis bij"_

**Quick Take**: The author views Islamic immigration as the primary driver of social decline and calls for complete closure of borders to Muslims.

### Elite Betrayal and Democratic Deficit
Klaassen argues that Dutch political elites have systematically ignored the will of ordinary citizens, particularly the 40% who never vote. He claims politicians prioritize globalist agendas over national interests and implement policies that harm ordinary Dutch people while benefiting immigrants and international organizations.

> "Politicians go about appointments, not about policy."
> _Original: "politici gaan over baantjes en niet over beleid"_

**Quick Take**: The book frames Dutch democracy as broken, with elites making decisions without public consultation or respect for traditional Dutch citizens.

### Economic Burden of Multiculturalism
The author presents extensive examples of what he considers wasteful spending on immigrants and failed integration policies. He argues that two-thirds of social welfare funds already go to immigration-related costs, making the welfare state unsustainable and harming native Dutch citizens who have paid into the system their entire lives.

> "The welfare state becomes untenable due to immigration."
> _Original: "de verzorgingsstaat wordt door de immigratie onhoudbaar"_

**Quick Take**: The book presents immigration as an economic drain that threatens bankruptcy of the Dutch social system.

### Cultural Erosion and Identity Loss
Klaassen documents what he sees as the systematic replacement of Dutch culture with foreign traditions and values. He complains about changes to Christmas celebrations, the removal of Zwarte Piet, and the accommodation of Islamic practices in schools and public institutions.

> "Cultural heritage belongs to the Dutch people, not to intruding foreigners."
> _Original: "cultureel erfgoed is van de Nederlanders en niet van indringende buitenlanders"_

**Quick Take**: The author calls for preservation of Dutch cultural traditions and resistance to multicultural accommodation.

### The Sweden Warning
The book uses Sweden as a cautionary tale, claiming that uncontrolled immigration has made it impossible for businesses to operate profitably and has led to societal collapse. He warns that the Netherlands is on the same trajectory unless dramatic policy changes are implemented.

> "In Sweden there is talk of moving Volvo and Scania to another country because immigration has made it totally impossible to operate profitably as a company."
> _Original: "in Zweden is sprake van een verhuizing van Volvo en Scania naar een ander land omdat het in Zweden totaal onmogelijk is gemaakt om als bedrijf rendabel te werken door de immigranten die het land kapot maken"_

**Quick Take**: The author presents Sweden as evidence of what awaits the Netherlands if current immigration policies continue.

## Questions to Consider

1. Is it possible to restrict immigration while maintaining Dutch international commitments and economic competitiveness?
2. How can societies balance cultural preservation with the rights of minorities and religious freedom?
3. What role should non-voters play in a democracy, and how can their concerns be addressed?
4. At what point does immigration become unsustainable for a small, densely populated country like the Netherlands?
5. How can European countries cooperate on immigration while maintaining national sovereignty?

## Conclusion
This book represents a stark, right-wing populist critique of contemporary Dutch society and immigration policy. It captures genuine frustrations about rapid demographic change, economic pressure on social services, and perceived cultural displacement, but presents them through an inflammatory lens that simplifies complex issues and promotes exclusionary solutions.

For readers seeking to understand the political currents fueling right-wing populism in the Netherlands, this book serves as an unfiltered expression of grievances that have become significant in Dutch politics. However, its simplistic analysis, generalizations about immigrant populations, and lack of empirical evidence make it more valuable as insight into populist sentiment than as a serious policy document.

The book's primary value lies in its raw collection of everyday complaints and frustrations that many Dutch citizens apparently feel but which mainstream political discourse often avoids or downplays. Whether one agrees with the author's conclusions or not, these sentiments have undeniably become a major force in Dutch politics and deserve to be understood.
