# Doing Agile Right
**Authors**: Darrell Rigby, Sarah Elk, Steve Berez | **Year**: 2020

## Summary
This book confronts a critical reality in modern business: while Agile has gone mainstream, most companies are implementing it wrong, creating chaos instead of transformation. The authors argue that **Agile and bureaucracy must coexist as complementary forces**, not enemies. Drawing from extensive research at Bain & Company and case studies from companies like Bosch, Amazon, and ING, they reveal how "Bad Agile drives out Good Agile" – when organizations implement Agile poorly through misunderstanding or copying popular models like Spotify, they create poor results that discredit the entire movement and set back corporate innovation.

The book provides a balanced approach to Agile transformation that rejects both rigid bureaucracy and chaotic implementation. It's written for senior leaders in large organizations who need practical guidance on scaling Agile without sacrificing stability, accountability, or business results. Readers will learn how to avoid the three toxic mistakes of Agile implementation and develop the four essential capabilities for sustainable transformation.

## Core Insights

### The Three Toxic Mistakes of Agile Implementation
Many organizations fail at Agile by falling into predictable traps that undermine the entire transformation. The first mistake is **"Agile, Agile, Everywhere"** – trying to replace bureaucracy completely in all functions, which eliminates essential controls and creates chaos. The second is **"Let's Have You Folks Do Agile"** – a top-down Taylorist approach where executives delegate Agile practices to teams without changing their own leadership behaviors. The third is **"Agile as a Quick Fix"** – copying popular frameworks like Spotify's organizational model or attempting big-bang transformations without considering cultural fit or business context.

> "You keep using that word. I do not think it means what you think it means." – The authors quote *The Princess Bride* to describe how executives misunderstand Agile

**Quick Take**: Successful Agile transformation requires leadership participation first, then gradual customization of frameworks to your specific culture and business context.

### Agile and Bureaucracy Must Coexist
The book's central insight is that Agile and bureaucracy are not enemies but partners that need careful balancing. The authors introduce the concept of finding the **"Golden Mean"** – the optimal level of agility for each business that balances stasis and chaos. They use the Bain Agility Quotient to measure and determine appropriate agility levels, showing that more agile isn't always better. Companies like Bosch Power Tools successfully transformed 20,000 employees by maintaining essential controls while introducing Agile practices, while ING Netherlands' big-bang approach traumatized the organization.

**Quick Take**: Measure your current agility, determine the optimal level for your business context, and build complementary systems that balance innovation with control.

### Leadership Behavior Change is Non-Negotiable
The hardest and most crucial part of Agile transformation is changing leadership behaviors. The authors argue that leaders must shift from supervising subordinates to leading teams, mentoring, and spending time with customers. They found that executives who practice Agile principles themselves are 3-5 times more successful than those who only delegate Agile to others. The Dell Management Model (DMM) exemplifies this approach with adaptive planning cycles where leaders focus on guiding what needs to be done while leaving how to accomplish it to teams.

**Four key leadership behaviors** identified: guide what to do, leave how to teams, focus initiatives, and update plans frequently.

**Quick Take**: Leaders must model Agile practices themselves rather than just mandating them for others – personal transformation precedes organizational transformation.

### Harmonize the Complete Operating Model
Structure changes alone are insufficient for successful Agile transformation. The authors emphasize the need to address six interconnected elements: structure, leadership, planning, people, processes, and technology. They warn against the common mistake of copying organizational charts from successful companies without understanding the underlying systems. Amazon's success with "two-pizza teams" works because of their entire operating model, not just team size. The book provides a comprehensive framework for ensuring all elements work together rather than implementing changes piecemeal.

**Quick Take**: Focus on customer solutions first, then design processes and technology to support them, ensuring all six operating model elements evolve together rather than in isolation.

### Test, Learn, and Adapt Continuously
The most successful companies approach Agile transformation as a journey of continuous learning rather than a one-time implementation. They start small, measure progress, and adapt their approach based on results. The authors provide practical frameworks like the Scaled Agile Framework (SAFe) but emphasize that these should be customized, not copied. They contrast MagicAgile, which implemented Agile everywhere and lost 50% of its market value, with companies that take a measured approach and achieve sustainable results.

**Quick Take**: Treat Agile transformation as a series of experiments with clear metrics, regular assessments, and willingness to pivot based on what actually works in your context.

## Action Items
- Assess your organization's current agility using the Bain Agility Quotient or similar framework
- Start with personal leadership behavior change before mandating team changes
- Choose 2-3 Agile frameworks and customize them to your culture rather than copying blindly
- Focus on customer solutions first, then adapt processes and technology to support them
- Implement changes gradually with continuous testing and learning rather than big-bang approaches
- Balance Agile practices with essential bureaucratic controls based on business context
- Ensure all six operating model elements (structure, leadership, planning, people, processes, technology) evolve together
- Maintain clear accountability for meaningful business results, not just Agile practice adoption

## Questions to Consider
- What is the optimal level of agility for our specific business context and industry?
- How can we balance the need for innovation with essential controls and stability?
- Are our leaders truly modeling Agile behaviors, or just delegating them to teams?
- Which bureaucratic elements are essential to preserve, and which can be eliminated?
- How can we measure both Agile adoption and business results to ensure we're creating value?
- What aspects of our culture support or hinder Agile transformation?
- How can we create psychological safety for teams to experiment and learn from failure?

## Conclusion
This book is essential reading for senior leaders who want to implement Agile transformation without the chaos that typically accompanies it. The authors provide a balanced, practical approach that avoids both the trap of rigid bureaucracy and the danger of chaotic implementation. Their research-backed insights and real-world case studies offer a roadmap for sustainable transformation that delivers actual business results rather than just adopting Agile practices for their own sake.

The biggest reason to read this book is its emphasis on **balance over extremism**. Rather than presenting Agile as a silver bullet that replaces all traditional management practices, the authors show how to harmonize Agile with existing systems in a way that respects organizational context, culture, and business needs. For leaders tired of Agile transformations that promise everything but deliver chaos, this book provides the pragmatic guidance needed to achieve real, sustainable results.
