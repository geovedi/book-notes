# Why the Germans Do It Better
**Authors**: John Kampfner | **Year**: 2020

## Summary
John Kampfner's provocative analysis argues that Germany has become a model nation excelling in areas where other countries, particularly Britain, have struggled. Drawing from a year of travels across Germany and interviews with citizens from all walks of life, Kampfner examines how Germany transformed from the pariah nation of the 20th century into a beacon of democratic stability, economic resilience, and moral leadership.

The book explores six key areas where Germans demonstrate superior performance: democratic architecture, economic management, social cohesion, environmental policy, immigration integration, and crisis leadership. Kampfner argues this success isn't accidental but stems from Germany's deliberate post-war project to build a society based on confronting its past, prioritizing democratic values, and balancing individual freedom with collective responsibility.

This book offers valuable insights for policymakers, business leaders, and citizens interested in understanding successful governance models, European politics, and how nations can learn from historical failures to build better futures.

## Core Insights

### Historical Memory as Democratic Foundation
Germany's greatest strength lies in its uncompromising confrontation with history through **Vergangenheitsbewältigung** (coming to terms with history) and **Erinnerungskultur** (culture of remembrance). Unlike countries that celebrate past glories, Germany built its identity on acknowledging historical crimes. This creates what Germans call **"constitutional patriotism"** - pride not in flags or military victories, but in their democratic Basic Law (**Grundgesetz**) of 1949.

> "The creation of West Germany's post-war political architecture is one of the great triumphs of liberal democracy... a constitution so successful that it is cited by Germans as their object of greatest pride."

**Quick Take**: By confronting their darkest chapters, Germans built democratic safeguards that make them uniquely resilient to authoritarianism.

### The Mittelstand Economic Miracle
While America pursued quarterly capitalism and Britain embraced financial services, Germany maintained its **Mittelstand** - small and medium-sized manufacturing companies that form the backbone of the economy. These family-owned businesses prioritize long-term stability over short-term profits, invest heavily in worker training, and maintain global competitiveness through specialized innovation.

**Why Germans "Do It Better"**: The Mittelstand employs 75% of the German workforce and generates 50% of economic output, combining traditional craftsmanship with cutting-edge technology. Their apprentice system produces skilled workers while maintaining social mobility.

### Mutti Merkel's Scientific Leadership
Angela Merkel's 15-year chancellorship exemplifies German preference for **"Mutti's Warm Embrace"** - stable, grounded, fact-based leadership rather than charismatic spectacle. A trained physicist and former East German, Merkel approached crises from the 2008 financial crash to COVID-19 with scientific method rather than political grandstanding.

**Quick Take**: German voters value reliability over rhetoric, expertise over ideology, and evidence over emotion - qualities increasingly rare in populist-era politics.

### Willkommenskultur - Welcome Culture
Germany's 2015 refugee response, when Merkel declared **"Wir schaffen das"** ("We can handle it"), demonstrated moral leadership absent elsewhere. Over one million Syrian refugees were welcomed through an unprecedented mobilization of civil society volunteers, local government coordination, and business integration programs.

**Why Germans "Do It Better"**: Despite political challenges, Germany's demographic reality and historical conscience drive pragmatic immigration policies combining humanitarian values with economic necessity.

### Energiewende - Environmental Transformation
Germany leads the world in **Energiewende** (energy transition), deliberately phasing out nuclear and fossil fuels while building renewable infrastructure. This long-term environmental planning combines Green movement activism (born from 1970s protests) with German industrial capability.

**Quick Take**: Germany proves that advanced economies can pursue ambitious climate policies without economic collapse - though the transition remains ongoing and challenging.

### Social Solidarity and Work-Life Balance
Germans maintain strong social cohesion through what they call **"the dog doesn't eat the dog"** - mutual obligation between employers, employees, and the state. Powerful trade unions like IG Metall negotiate fair wages while supporting worker retraining. German workers enjoy shorter hours, longer vacations, and stronger job security than most Western counterparts.

**Why Germans "Do It Better"**: Germany balances market efficiency with social welfare, avoiding both American-style inequality and Southern European economic stagnation.

## Questions to Consider
- How might other countries apply Germany's lessons about confronting difficult history?
- Can the Mittelstand model be replicated in different economic contexts?
- What aspects of German governance might not transfer well to other cultures?
- How will Germany manage challenges from rising populism and demographic change?
- Is German "betterness" sustainable or dependent on specific historical circumstances?

## Conclusion
Kampfner makes a compelling case that Germany's success stems not from cultural superiority but from learned lessons and deliberate choices. By building systems based on historical memory, democratic values, and long-term thinking, Germany created a resilient society that weathers crises better than most.

While the book occasionally idealizes Germany and underplays ongoing challenges (particularly around immigration integration and Eastern German economic disparities), its core argument stands: in an era of democratic backsliding and populist turmoil, Germany offers a powerful example of how countries can transform through collective learning and institutional building.

**Is this worth your time?** Absolutely. For anyone interested in understanding successful governance, European politics, or how societies can learn from historical failures, "Why the Germans Do It Better" provides essential insights. Its biggest contribution is showing that democratic resilience and economic success aren't accidents - they're the results of deliberate choices and institutional design other countries can learn from.
