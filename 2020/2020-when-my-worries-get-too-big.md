## Summary
"When My Worries Get Too Big" is a practical, child-friendly guide designed to help anxious children understand and manage their anxiety through a simple 5-point scale system. The book uses cognitive behavioral management principles to teach children self-regulation skills, making abstract emotions concrete and manageable through visual supports and interactive exercises.

This book is perfect for parents, teachers, and caregivers working with children aged 5-12 who struggle with anxiety, particularly those with developmental disorders like autism spectrum disorder. Children will learn to identify their anxiety levels and develop personalized calming strategies.

## Core Insights

### The 5-Point Anxiety Scale
The book's centerpiece is a visual 5-level scale that helps children identify and quantify their anxiety levels:
- **Level 1**: Relaxed, happy, calm
- **Level 2**: Mildly worried but still functional
- **Level 3**: Increasing anxiety, noticeable discomfort
- **Level 4**: High anxiety, physical symptoms (stomach aches), potential for outbursts
- **Level 5**: Maximum anxiety, loss of control, meltdowns

> "Anxiety is a normal reaction to stress, but when it becomes excessive and interferes with daily life, we need tools to manage it."
> _Original: "焦虑是应对压力的正常反应，实际上在某些情况下它可能还是有益的。然而，如果儿童焦虑过度，严重干扰到家庭和学校的正常生活，那麻烦就来了。"_

**Quick Take**: This scale transforms abstract feelings into concrete, measurable states children can understand and communicate to adults.

### The "Relaxation Routine" Strategy
The book teaches a specific 5-step calming sequence that children can memorize and use automatically when anxiety starts to build:
1. Take 3 deep breaths
2. Raise arms overhead, lower, repeat
3. Rub hands together while counting to 3
4. Rub thighs while counting to 3
5. Take one final deep breath

> "I can stop, put my hands together tightly, and do 3 very slow deep breaths. Slow in—slow out."
> _Original: "首先，把两只手紧紧地握在一起。然后，做3次非常慢的深呼吸。慢慢吸气——慢慢呼气。"_

**Quick Take**: This routine becomes an automatic response through practice, bypassing the need for complex thinking during high-anxiety moments.

### Personalized Coping Strategies
Each child creates their own toolkit of calming strategies based on their interests and preferences, which may include:
- Thinking about favorite things (pets, toys, special places)
- Physical activities (walking, stretching)
- Seeking a quiet, safe space
- Looking at photos of happy memories

> "When I think about my dog, my lion toy, or our little cabin in summer, I come back to level 1."
> _Original: "我还可以想一想让我开心的东西，比如，我的小狗、狮子公仔或是夏天我家住的小木屋。现在我回到了1级。"_

**Quick Take**: Personalized strategies are more effective because they connect to the child's specific interests and comfort zones.

## Best Quotes

- "I sometimes get worried easily, but I also have my own strengths! When I think about things I like, I feel very relaxed."
  _Original: "我有时会容易着急，但我也有自己的强项哦！一想到我喜欢的东西，我就会感到很放松。"_

- "Anxiety thinking reaches the brain before rational thinking, so children need to learn predictable, well-practiced routines."
  _Original: "还要记住一个要点，'焦虑式思维'先于'思考式思维'到达大脑。因此，如果不想让焦虑这种情绪变得太强烈的话，儿童就要学习一个可预测的、多次练习后能牢记的例行程序。"_

- "Behavioral outbursts are private matters. Children feel embarrassed when they lose control, even if you can't obviously sense their regret afterward."
  _Original: "还要记住一个要点，行为爆发是一件私事。儿童会因为行为失控而感到尴尬，没能成功地控制自己的行为会让他非常在意。"_

- "I can control them! The feeling of being at level 1 is great, and I'm proud of myself!"
  _Original: "处于1级的感觉真好，我为自己感到骄傲！"_

## Action Items

- **Create a visual anxiety scale** with your child, letting them define what each level feels like for them personally

## Questions to Consider

- What situations typically trigger your child's highest anxiety levels?
