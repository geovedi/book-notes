# Henry V: The Play and Historical Analysis
**Original Authors**: William Shakespeare, William Hazlitt | **Year**: 2020

## Summary
This comprehensive volume combines Shakespeare's historical play "Henry V" with William Hazlitt's critical analysis and extensive biographical context about the historical King Henry V. The work examines both the literary masterpiece and the complex historical figure behind the legend, offering readers insights into medieval warfare, leadership, and the transformation of a prince into a warrior-king.

For literature students, history enthusiasts, and theater lovers, this collection provides a unique dual perspective - exploring how Shakespeare dramatized history while revealing the often less romantic historical realities that inspired his work. Readers gain understanding of medieval politics, the nature of kingship, and the artistic license that shapes national myths.

## Core Insights

### The Two Henrys: Literary Hero vs. Historical Reality
Shakespeare presents Henry V as the ideal Christian king - brave, just, and inspirational. His famous St. Crispin's Day speech ("We few, we happy few") has defined English courage for centuries. However, Hazlitt's analysis reveals a more complex historical figure who was "fond of war and low company," careless and ambitious, using "brute force, glossed over with a little religious hypocrisy" to achieve his ends.

> "Henry V. is a very favourite monarch with the English nation, and he appears to have been also a favourite with Shakespear, who labours hard to apologise for the actions of the king, by shewing us the character of the man, as 'the king of good fellows.'" - William Hazlitt

**Quick Take**: Shakespeare created national mythology while Hazlitt reminds us that historical heroes rarely match their dramatic portrayals.

### The Prince Hal Transformation: Myth vs. History
Shakespeare's "Prince Hal" spends his youth in taverns with Falstaff before dramatically reforming to become the great Henry V. This narrative provides compelling character development but historical evidence suggests the real Prince Henry was actually governing Wales from age fifteen, fighting Welsh rebels, and learning statecraft rather than carousing in London taverns.

> "The brilliant figure, then, of the first and second parts of Henry the Fourth is at least a literary fact. I do not propose to enter on a connected discussion of its authenticity. There are many genuinely historical details which we have about Henry's real personality..." - The Biographer

**Quick Take**: Shakespeare needed dramatic transformation; history provides gradual development through responsibility and experience.

### Medieval Warfare and Leadership
The play's famous speeches glorify medieval warfare while Hazlitt's analysis reveals its brutal reality. Henry's invasion of France, depicted as righteous claim-restoring in the play, was essentially opportunistic aggression. The Battle of Agincourt, celebrated as English valor against overwhelming odds, resulted from French tactical errors and weather conditions as much as English bravery.

> "He was a hero, that is, he was ready to sacrifice his own life for the pleasure of destroying thousands of other lives: he was a king of England, but not a constitutional one..." - William Hazlitt

**Quick Take**: Military leadership in the Middle Ages combined personal courage with calculated ruthlessness; national glory often masked individual suffering.

### The Nature of Kingship and Divine Right
Both the play and analysis explore how medieval kingship operated. Shakespeare's Henry struggles with the weight of crown and ceremony, ultimately accepting divine right as justification for his actions. Hazlitt reveals this as political necessity - Henry needed both religious sanction and military success to legitimize his doubtful claim to the throne.

> "The object of our late invasion and conquest of France was to restore the legitimate monarch, the descendant of Hugh Capet, to the throne: Henry V. in his time made war on and deposed the descendant of this very Hugh Capet, on the plea that he was a usurper and illegitimate." - William Hazlitt

**Quick Take**: Medieval kingship required blending military might, religious legitimacy, and political propaganda - skills Henry V mastered expertly.

## Best Quotes

- "O for a muse of fire, that would ascend the brightest heaven of invention, a kingdom for a stage, princes to act, and monarchs to behold the swelling scene!" - Shakespeare, Prologue to Henry V

- "We few, we happy few, we band of brothers; For he to-day that sheds his blood with me shall be my brother." - Shakespeare, Henry's St. Crispin's Day Speech

- "Henry V. is but one of Shakespear's second-rate plays. Yet by quoting passages, like this, from his second-rate plays alone, we might make a volume 'rich with his praise.'" - William Hazlitt

- "The substitution of right for might, even in theory, is among the refinements and abuses of modern philosophy." - William Hazlitt

- "What infinite heart's ease must kings neglect, that private men enjoy? And what have kings, that privates have not too, save ceremony?" - Shakespeare, King Henry V

## Key Takeaways
- Distinguish between Shakespeare's dramatic portrayal and historical reality when studying Henry V
- Appreciate how national myths often serve political and cultural purposes beyond historical accuracy
- Understand that medieval leadership required different skills and moral frameworks than modern governance
- Recognize how literary genius can transform complex historical figures into enduring cultural symbols

## Questions to Consider
How much does Shakespeare's portrayal influence our understanding of actual English history?
Can great literature be appreciated even when it misrepresents historical truth?
What makes the Henry V character compelling despite his questionable historical actions?
How do modern values affect our judgment of medieval rulers and their decisions?

## Conclusion
This collection offers fascinating insights into how literature shapes historical memory. While Hazlitt's analysis convincingly debunks much of Shakespeare's romantic portrayal, the play's power remains undiminished. Henry V works brilliantly as theater and national mythology, even if the historical king was less admirable. The value lies not in choosing between truth and beauty, but in understanding how both serve different human needs - literature gives us inspiration and shared cultural touchstones, while historical analysis keeps us grounded in complex reality. For anyone interested in how stories become legends, or how nations construct their identities through carefully curated narratives, this volume provides exceptional material for reflection on the relationship between art, truth, and cultural memory.
