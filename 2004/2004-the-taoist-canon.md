# The Taoist Canon: A Historical Companion to the Daozang

**Authors**: Kristofer Schipper, Franciscus Verellen | **Year**: 2004

## Summary
This monumental three-volume scholarly work provides the first comprehensive historical guide to the Daozang (Taoist Canon), the vast collection of approximately 1,500 texts that form the foundation of Taoist religious, philosophical, and practical traditions. Compiled under imperial auspices throughout Chinese history, the Daozang represents not just a library but the evolving corporate identity of Taoism within Chinese civilization. The book serves as both a classified bibliography and a historical narrative, organizing the canon's contents according to chronological periods and typological categories that reveal how Taoism developed and defined itself over two millennia.

The work reveals that the Daozang is far more than mystical philosophy—it contains over half its content dedicated to liturgy, ritual instructions, and ceremonial texts, making it primarily a practical guide for religious practice. The remaining texts encompass alchemy, medicine, philosophy, sacred history, and various arts of longevity and transformation. Through meticulous scholarship, the editors trace how the canon evolved from early catalogs of Taoist works to the highly structured Three Caverns system that integrated diverse Taoist traditions into a unified whole.

**Who should read this**: Scholars of Chinese religion, historians of religion, Taoist practitioners, and anyone interested in how religious traditions organize and preserve their sacred literature. Readers will gain deep insight into Taoism's self-understanding and its role within Chinese religious and intellectual landscapes.

## Core Insights

### The Three Caverns: Taoism's Organizational Genius
The Three Caverns (Sandong) system, established in the fifth century by Lu Xiujing, represents one of the most brilliant achievements in religious canon formation. This organizational structure successfully integrated three fundamental aspects of religious practice: individual mystical seeking (Dongzhen - Cavern of Truth), collective liturgical celebration (Dongxuan - Cavern of Mystery), and communion with divine forces (Dongshen - Cavern of Divinity). Unlike many religious traditions that splinter over differences in practice, the Three Caverns system allowed Taoism to maintain unity while accommodating diverse approaches to spiritual realization.

> "Lu Xiujing's three-tiered canon is a work of genius that allowed Taoism to develop and remain a single tradition. Its multiple forms of practice did not result in any schisms. Its great flexibility enabled it to survive many persecutions."

**Quick Take**: The Three Caverns system demonstrates how organizational wisdom can preserve religious diversity while maintaining institutional unity.

### Canon as Living Tradition, Not Fixed Doctrine
The Daozang evolved dynamically through Chinese history, with each imperial dynasty recompiling and reorganizing the collection according to contemporary needs and understandings. This process reveals that Taoism viewed its canon not as closed scripture but as an ongoing conversation with the Tao, continuously revealed through new scriptures, liturgical developments, and practical innovations. The canon's flexibility allowed it to absorb Buddhist influences, integrate local cults, and respond to changing political and cultural circumstances while maintaining its essential identity.

> "The history of the Taoist canon can be read as a core history of Taoism itself in its continuous interaction with the rest of the Chinese religious system."

**Quick Take**: Religious vitality depends on the ability to honor tradition while remaining open to new revelation and adaptation.

### Ritual Transmission as Canonical Authority
Unlike books intended for general circulation, many Daozang texts were considered sacred precisely because their transmission was restricted to initiated practitioners within ritual contexts. This system of controlled transmission, known as "ke" (classification) and "keyi" (ritual of classification), elevated practical liturgical texts to canonical status. The relationship between scripture and ritual in Taoism is therefore not incidental but foundational—texts gain their authority through their role in ceremonial practice, while rituals derive their power from the scriptures they embody.

> "The strong link ties scriptures to ritual in Taoist history, and this relationship has influenced the way Taoism thinks about texts, as well as about writing in general."

**Quick Take**: In many traditions, practical application and sacred transmission are more important than broad accessibility for establishing spiritual authority.

### Taoism as China's Indigenous Alternative
The Daozang preserves and transmits a significant body of Chinese popular religion and indigenous practices that stood outside the Confucian-Buddhist mainstream that came to dominate Chinese intellectual life. As a "bastion of Chinese indigenous tradition," the canon contains materials that might otherwise have been lost, including local deities, regional practices, and folk beliefs that maintained China's religious diversity. The very existence of an independent Taoist canon represents Taoism's successful negotiation of its place within Chinese civilization as an alternative to both Confucian state orthodoxy and imported Buddhist traditions.

> "The Daozang constitutes perhaps the richest, and still scarcely explored mine of primary sources on all aspects of the history, thought, and organization of the various strata of China's civil society that were labeled as 'Taoist.'"

**Quick Take**: Independent canonical collections are crucial for preserving cultural and religious diversity against dominant mainstream traditions.

### Imperial Patronage and Preservation
The survival and compilation of the Daozang depended heavily on imperial support, beginning with the Kaiyuan era canon under Emperor Xuanzong (712-756) and culminating in the Ming dynasty edition that forms the basis of the modern canon. This imperial patronage was double-edged—it provided resources for preservation and distribution but also subjected Taoism to political control and periodic suppression. The story of how the canon survived destruction and repressive measures, particularly the near-total loss of all editions except the Ming version, demonstrates the fragility and resilience of religious traditions.

**Quick Take**: The preservation of religious wisdom often depends on the complex relationship between spiritual communities and political power.

## Best Quotes

- "The Taoist canon is a vast collection of texts in a wide variety of genres that comprehensively define Taoism and its scriptural development through the ages. Along with revealed books, ritual texts, inspired poetry, and other religious documents, this library of the Tao contains works on subjects of broad interest to students of Chinese thought—philosophy, cosmology, medicine—as well as encyclopedic compendia, literary anthologies, and collected works of individual authors."

- "At one level, the question of whether or not a work belongs in the canon reflects the give and take over the integration of distinct cults and text traditions into the liturgical system of Taoism. From the Taoist perspective, the object of this negotiation was the evolving corporate identity of Taoism in Chinese society."

- "Ritual is as central to the canon as it is to Taoism itself. A strong link ties scriptures to ritual in Taoist history, and this relationship has influenced the way Taoism thinks about texts, as well as about writing in general."

- "The place of preeminence, in terms of ranking and volume, is given to liturgy. This vast category comprises the scriptures to be ritually recited, the hymns to be chanted, the memorials to be read, as well as the instructions for meditation and visualization to be performed within the framework of the Retreat and Offering services. All in all, these works account for some 800 texts, more than half of the Ming canon."

- "The exploration of this neglected treasure house of information has been held back by its apparent impenetrability. To some extent, this is due to the esoteric or ahistorical nature of certain Taoist writings. In large part, however, generations of scholars have come to regard the Taoist canon as inaccessible as a result of the manner by which the Daozang was assembled and organized over the centuries."

## Key Takeaways

- **Study religious traditions through their organizational structures**: The way traditions organize and classify their texts reveals deep insights into their self-understanding and priorities.

- **Recognize the interdependence of theory and practice**: In Taoism, philosophical concepts and ritual practices are inseparable—each gives meaning and authority to the other.

- **Value comprehensive collections**: The Daozang demonstrates the importance of preserving not just core scriptures but the full range of a tradition's intellectual and practical heritage.

- **Understand canons as historical documents**: The evolution of the Daozang through different dynasties shows how religious collections reflect changing political and cultural contexts.

- **Respect the complexity of religious identity**: Taoism's ability to incorporate diverse practices while maintaining unity offers a model for religious pluralism and adaptation.

## Questions to Consider

- How does the Taoist approach to canon formation differ from Western religious traditions, and what can we learn from these differences?

- In what ways might the balance between restricted transmission and broad accessibility affect the vitality and preservation of spiritual traditions?

- How does the emphasis on liturgy and practice over doctrine in the Daozang reflect different priorities in spiritual life compared to other religious canons?

- What role should imperial or political patronage play in the preservation and development of religious traditions?

- How might modern religious traditions benefit from understanding Taoism's flexible approach to canon formation and evolution?

## Conclusion
This scholarly masterpiece is essential reading for anyone serious about understanding Chinese religion or the history of how religious traditions organize and preserve their wisdom. While highly specialized and academically demanding, it reveals the Daozang as one of the world's most remarkable religious collections—comprehensive in scope, sophisticated in organization, and profoundly influential in Chinese civilization.

The book's greatest contribution is showing how the Taoist canon represents not just a library of texts but a living, evolving tradition that successfully negotiated its place within Chinese religious culture for two millennia. The Three Caverns system alone stands as one of history's most brilliant achievements in religious organization, allowing diversity without schism and preserving both unity and variety.

**Is it worth your time?** For scholars of Chinese religion, absolutely essential. For general readers interested in religious studies, highly valuable but challenging. The biggest reason to engage with this work is its revelation of how religious traditions can maintain continuity while adapting to changing circumstances—a lesson with relevance far beyond Taoist studies.
