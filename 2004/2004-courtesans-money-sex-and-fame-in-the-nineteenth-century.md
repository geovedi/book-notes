# Courtesans: Money, Sex and Fame in the Nineteenth Century
**Author**: Katie Hickman | **Year**: 2004 | **Category**: History & Biography

## Summary
Katie Hickman's "Courtesans" illuminates the fascinating and often misunderstood world of five remarkable women—Sophia Baddeley, Elizabeth Armistead, Harriette Wilson, Cora Pearl, and Catherine Walters—who dominated London's demi-monde during the nineteenth century. These women were far more than high-class prostitutes; they were cultured, wealthy, and astonishingly independent females who carved out unprecedented autonomy in an era that offered women virtually no legitimate paths to power or financial independence.

This book reveals how courtesans existed in a complex social limbo—neither respectable women nor common prostitutes, but something entirely different. They chose their patrons carefully, offered companionship and conversation alongside erotic favors, and commanded fabulous sums that could make them richer than aristocrats. Their stories challenge our understanding of gender, power, and sexuality in Victorian England, showing how these women leveraged their unique position to achieve levels of freedom and influence otherwise impossible for their sex.

Readers interested in women's history, social history, and the hidden economies of the nineteenth century will discover how these women navigated society's strictures to become celebrities, trendsetters, and powerful players in their own right.

## Core Insights

### The Ambiguous World of the Demi-Monde
The most captivating aspect of the courtesan's identity was her deliberate ambiguity. As Hickman explains, courtesans were "not a mere prostitute, although she is unequivocally a 'professional' woman who accepts money in return for sexual favours. Neither is she a mistress, who usually considers herself the lover of just one man." Unlike prostitutes who served all-comers, courtesans carefully selected their patrons, very often for their own pleasure as well as their clients'. Their gifts extended far beyond physical intimacy to include company, conversation, and cultural sophistication—qualities that made them prized companions for the wealthiest and most powerful men of their era.

This ambiguity granted them a unique social power. They inhabited what Alexandre Dumas fils memorably called the "demi-monde"—a parallel universe that was simultaneously glittering and ghostly. In this space, they could achieve levels of independence and wealth that were otherwise impossible for women, yet they remained social outcasts denied official recognition by respectable society.

### Economic Independence as Revolutionary Act
The courtesans' ability to accumulate and control wealth represented a quiet revolution in gender relations. Laura Bell allegedly received £250,000 (nearly £12 million today) for a single night with the Nepalese Prince Jung Bahadoor. Catherine Walters maintained expensive stables and properties, while Cora Pearl's pearls alone were worth more than £40,000. This economic freedom gave them genuine autonomy—the power to choose lovers, set their own schedules, live independently, and shape their destinies in ways few women of their time could imagine.

Their financial success was built on sophisticated business acumen. They understood branding, reputation management, and investment long before these concepts existed in modern business theory. They didn't just follow fashion—they created it. When Catherine Walters ("Skittles") appeared in Rotten Row, "Ladies of the aristocracy rushed to copy the perfect cut of her riding habit, while their husbands wondered whether she could possibly be wearing any undergarments at all beneath its skin-tight folds."

### Cultural Power and Celebrity Status
Courtesans were among the first true celebrities in modern culture—famous for being famous, with their every move scrutinized and emulated. They didn't simply participate in cultural life; they shaped it. The presence of Sophia Baddeley in a theatre box could stop a show, as when playwright Samuel Foote pointed her out during a performance, drawing "thunder of applause" that forced the actress to rise and curtsy repeatedly to the adoring crowd.

Their cultural influence extended beyond fashion to literature, art, and politics. Harriette Wilson's memoirs caused a sensation when she threatened to publish the names of her powerful lovers unless they paid her not to. The Duke of Wellington famously replied, "Publish and be damned!"—showing both her social power and the risks she took. These women moved in the highest circles, confiding with prime ministers, influencing political decisions, and befriending leading artists and writers of their day.

### The Personal Costs of Social Transgression
Despite their glamour and influence, courtesans paid a heavy price for their unconventional lives. Sophia Baddeley's trajectory from celebrated actress to pauper laudanum addict illustrates the precariousness of their position. "Just fifteen years later, the notorious courtesan was dead: a pauper and a hopeless laudanum addict, the fabulous riches bestowed upon her by her many lovers blown, the jewels, the diamonds, the silks, the carriages, squandered or sold."

They endured profound social isolation—living in a world where respectable ladies pretended they didn't exist. As Lady Augusta Fane recalled in her hunting memoirs, "It was an unheard-of thing for any respectable dame to acknowledge that she knew such ladies as 'Skittles' existed, and the little squares and streets where they lived were completely out-of-bounds." This social exclusion meant they could never fully participate in the respectable world they influenced so powerfully.

### The Complex Nature of Beauty and Desire
Hickman challenges conventional ideas about female beauty, showing how courtesans' appeal went far beyond physical appearance. Many were not conventionally beautiful at all. Sir Walter Scott described Harriette Wilson as "a smart, saucy girl with good eyes and dark hair, and the manners of a wild schoolboy." Cora Pearl was considered by some to be positively ugly, yet her lovers included kings and princes.

Instead, their allure was multifaceted—combining wit, intelligence, conversation, and an uncanny ability to make men feel special. As Hickman notes, these women had "the gift of being able to make men think she was beautiful." Their power came from understanding that desire itself was more compelling than physical appearance alone. They cultivated complex personal brands that emphasized different qualities: some offered intellectual companionship, others provided emotional intimacy, still others mastered the art of mystery and unavailability.

## Best Quotes

- "Part of the allure of the courtesan, I think, is that she has always been an ambiguous figure. She is not a mere prostitute, although she is unequivocally a 'professional' woman who accepts money in return for sexual favours. Neither is she a mistress, who usually considers herself the lover of just one man."

- "In their own lifetimes English courtesans of the stature of Cora Pearl, Sophia Baddeley, Elizabeth Armistead, Harriette Wilson and Catherine Walters were important people. Whatever the narrow bourgeois view of their profession might have been, they felt they were worthy of respect, and they demanded it."

- "Courtesans did not follow the fashion; they were the fashion. For the young bloods of the nineteenth century, to be seen riding in the Park with Skittles, or attending the opera with Cora Pearl, was the apogee of social success."

- "These were highly cultured women; rich, famous and, most remarkably, independent females in an era in which this was almost an impossibility."

- "Such stories were like oxygen to the courtesan, transforming women of flesh and blood into fabulous, semi-mythical creatures."

## Conclusion

"Courtesans" is far more than a collection of sensational biographies—it's a thoughtful exploration of how women carved out unprecedented autonomy in one of history's most restrictive eras. Hickman's meticulous research and engaging prose bring these remarkable women to life as complex figures who were simultaneously powerful and vulnerable, celebrated and excluded, influential and isolated.

The book's greatest strength lies in its nuanced approach to its subjects. Hickman avoids both moral judgment and romanticization, instead presenting these women as they were: sophisticated businesswomen, cultural innovators, and social pioneers who found creative paths to independence in a world that offered women few legitimate options. Their stories reveal how power operates in unexpected ways—how marginalized people can leverage what society values (beauty, charm, sexuality) to achieve what society denies them (autonomy, wealth, influence).

This is absolutely worth your time if you're interested in women's history, social history, or the complex relationship between gender, power, and economics. The biggest reason to read it is to understand how innovation and resistance can flourish in the most unlikely places, and how the human drive for autonomy finds expression even within the most restrictive social boundaries. These women's stories remind us that history's most interesting figures are often those who lived between the categories, creating their own rules for survival and success.
