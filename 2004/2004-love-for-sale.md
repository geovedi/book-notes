**Author**: Nils Johan Ringdal | **Year**: 2004 | **Category**: History & Biography

## Summary

"Love for Sale" is a comprehensive historical examination of prostitution across civilizations and time periods, challenging common misconceptions about what many call "the world's oldest profession." Ringdal traces the complex relationship between prostitution, religion, family structures, and social morality from ancient Mesopotamia to modern times. Rather than being universal, the book reveals that prostitution emerged in specific historical contexts tied to state formation, religion, private property, and class divisions.

This monumental work will benefit historians, sociologists, and anyone interested in understanding how societies regulate sexuality. Readers gain insights into how prostitution has both reflected and shaped cultural attitudes toward women, sexuality, and morality across diverse civilizations.

## Core Insights

### Sacred Origins and Temple Prostitution

Prostitution first emerged in Western civilization within and around Mesopotamian temples dedicated to goddesses like Ishtar. Far from being merely commercial, these temple prostitutes served as sacred sex therapists, healers, and educators. The famous Epic of Gilgamesh (1800 B.C.) depicts a temple harlot civilizing the wild Enkidu through a week of intensive sexual and cultural education - not just sex but lessons in civilization itself.

Temple women possessed legal rights to own property and enjoyed more freedom than married women. They maintained knowledge about birth control, sexuality, and healing. Archaeological evidence shows clear distinctions between priestesses, their assistants, and free prostitutes - all under the protection of the love goddess.

> "The low-class prostitutes in taverns and inns lived beyond the temple walls in their own houses, called gagû, under the supervision of an older woman with a closer connection to the temple"

**Quick Take**: Prostitution began as sacred service, not sin, with women holding respected social and economic power.

### Family vs. Prostitution: The Fundamental Tension

Ringdal frames prostitution as fundamentally opposed to family structures. Demographically, prostitutes have more sex but fewer children than women in stable families. Morally, the family obliges men to take responsibility for offspring while prostitution offers "negative freedom" from such obligations.

The strength and status of family institutions directly determine prostitutes' social standing. When family emphasis diminishes, significant demographic effects follow. Different family structures (monogamy vs. polygamy, dowry vs. bride-price) create varying levels of acceptance for extramarital sex and thus different prostitution markets.

**Quick Take**: Prostitution thrives when family structures are weak, creating social tension between responsibility and freedom.

### The Victorian Moral Revolution

The Victorian era transformed Western attitudes toward sexuality and prostitution. Before Victorian morality, upper-class men regularly visited prostitutes with little social stigma, protected by physician confidentiality. Victorian individualism made morality intensely personal, influencing women's movements, workers' movements, and eventually turning private sexual matters into public political debates.

This Victorian framework continues shaping modern discourse about prostitution, feminism, and sexual rights. Ringdal argues that "the Victorians are still among us—clad in postmodernism," with similar patterns appearing in debates about syphilis then and AIDS now.

**Quick Take**: Victorian morality privatized sin and politicized sex, creating frameworks still governing today's prostitution debates.

### The Courtesan Phenomenon

The Renaissance birthed a new figure: the high-end courtesan who combined beauty with education and cultural sophistication. Unlike common prostitutes, courtesans like Veronica Franco and Imperia Cognata commanded enormous fees, spoke multiple languages, wrote poetry, and set fashion trends. They developed a unique "civilità puttanesca" - a high etiquette requiring cleanliness, musical proficiency, card skills, and business acumen.

Courtesans benefited from centuries of aristocratic training in gallant behavior and courtly love. As romance became more democratic, wealthy men increasingly chose sophisticated courtesans over available women of their own class, demonstrating how prostitution adapted to changing social conditions.

**Quick Take**: Economic and cultural changes created luxury markets where educated prostitutes could outcompete aristocratic women.

### Prostitution is Not Universal

Ringdal demolishes the myth that prostitution automatically appears in all societies. Twentieth-century anthropology documented numerous societies without prostitution (defined as sex exchanged for money). Prostitution requires specific conditions: state formation, religious systems, private property, and class divisions.

The book challenges evolutionary theories claiming natural progression from primal promiscuity to prostitution with money's advent. Instead, Ringdal shows prostitution emerged when specific social, economic, and religious conditions aligned - explaining why some societies developed extensive prostitution systems while others did not.

**Quick Take**: Prostitution is culturally contingent, not inevitable - it requires specific historical conditions to emerge.

## Best Quotes

- "The prostitute has traditionally stood as the symbol of sin, but precisely in this capacity is regarded as a guarantor and stabilizer of morality and matrimony in the rest of society."

- "Family and prostitution can be viewed as polar opposites, both morally and culturally. Fixed and regulated relations between the two sexes have always provided the best conditions for stable child rearing and the continuation of the family line."

- "When men or women do want to sell their bodies, they should have that full right without encountering punishment or discrimination. If the client behaves decently, the relationship between the sex buyer and the sex seller must be considered a purely private transaction."

## Action Items

- **Question Assumptions**: Challenge the notion that prostitution is "the world's oldest profession" - examine the historical and cultural conditions that make it possible
- **Analyze Family Systems**: Study how different family structures (dowry vs. bride-price, monogamy vs. polygamy) create different markets for sexual services
- **Recognize Sacred Origins**: Understand that prostitution began as religious service in many cultures, not as commercial vice
- **Track Moral Frameworks**: Notice how Victorian moral frameworks still shape modern debates about sexuality and prostitution

## Questions to Consider

1. If prostitution requires specific historical conditions, what does its absence in certain societies reveal about those cultures?
2. How does the tension between family responsibility and sexual freedom manifest in modern sexual politics?
3. In what ways do modern debates about sex work rights echo historical patterns of moral regulation?
4. If temple prostitutes once held respected positions as educators and healers, what does this reveal about changing attitudes toward female sexuality and knowledge?

## Conclusion

"Love for Sale" is absolutely worth your time as a groundbreaking work that reshapes understanding of prostitution's place in human history. Ringdal's meticulous research across 5,000 years reveals prostitution not as universal vice but as complex social institution reflecting fundamental tensions between family and freedom, sacred and commercial, public morality and private desire.

The book's greatest value lies in demolishing simplistic assumptions while revealing how prostitution has served as a mirror reflecting each society's deepest beliefs about women, sexuality, religion, and power. By understanding this history, we gain crucial perspective on current debates about sex work, human trafficking, and sexual rights - recognizing that our contemporary frameworks are neither natural nor inevitable, but part of an ongoing historical conversation about how societies regulate human desire.

Ringdal's compassionate yet scholarly approach provides neither romanticization nor condemnation, instead offering the nuanced understanding essential for informed discussion of one of history's most persistent and controversial human institutions.
