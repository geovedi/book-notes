# Make Time: The Survival Guide for Women With Too Much to Do
**Original Title**: Make Time: A survival guide for women with too much to do
**Author**: Pamela Allardice | **Year**: 2004 

## Summary
Make Time is a practical time management guide specifically designed for women juggling multiple roles as wives, mothers, caregivers, professionals, and homemakers. Written from personal experience balancing family and business, Allardice presents simple, actionable strategies to help overwhelmed women reclaim control of their schedules and create more space for themselves.

The book's central philosophy is that effective time management isn't about working harder—it's about working smarter and prioritizing what truly matters. Rather than seeking perfect work-life balance (which Allardice calls unrealistic), women should focus on catching responsibilities "before they hit the floor" through better organization and planning. The approach is both compassionate and practical, acknowledging that women today face around-the-clock time management challenges unlike men who primarily face these issues at work.

This guide serves busy women who feel trapped in the cycle of endless responsibilities, offering them concrete tools to reduce stress, decrease the constant "hurry-up" nature of their lives, and feel better prepared for whatever challenges arise. Readers will learn not just to manage their time, but to enjoy every precious minute of their lives.

## Core Insights

### The Female Advantage: Natural Time Management Skills
Women possess unique strengths in multitasking and juggling responsibilities that can be leveraged for better time management. Rather than seeing these abilities as burdens, women can recognize them as evolutionary advantages that make them naturally equipped to handle multiple competing demands. The key is channeling these innate skills intentionally rather than letting circumstances dictate priorities.

> _CHARLOTTE WHITTON, CANADIAN POLITICIAN_

**Quick Take**: Reframe your natural multitasking abilities as strengths rather than stressors, and use them strategically to create systems that work with your innate tendencies.

### Home Sweet Home: Creating Systems That Reduce Daily Friction
The book emphasizes that organized home systems are the foundation of time management success. By creating simple, repeatable processes for meals, cleaning, and household management, women can eliminate decision fatigue and reduce the mental load of running a household. This includes meal planning, organized storage solutions, and involving all family members in maintaining order.

Key strategies include designating specific places for frequently used items (like keys), creating organized systems for papers and information, and establishing routines that reduce daily chaos. The goal is to make the home environment work for you rather than against you.

**Quick Take**: Small organizational investments pay massive dividends in daily time savings and mental clarity.

### Getting Things Done: Streamlining Work and Personal Tasks
The book presents practical techniques for managing both professional responsibilities and personal commitments more efficiently. This includes handling interruptions, conducting effective meetings, managing communications, and leveraging technology appropriately. A key insight is that many time-wasters can be eliminated through strategic planning and setting clear boundaries.

Strategies include batching similar tasks together, using commute time productively, managing phone calls and emails efficiently, and learning to politely but firmly protect your time from unnecessary interruptions.

**Quick Take**: Protect your focus time ruthlessly and learn to distinguish between urgent and truly important demands.

### Health and Self-Care: Non-Negotiable Personal Time
Allardice emphasizes that self-care isn't selfish—it's essential for sustainable time management. Women must prioritize their health, fitness, and personal well-being to have the energy and mental clarity to manage everything else. This includes making time for exercise, proper nutrition, sleep, and personal interests.

The book presents realistic approaches to incorporating health habits into busy schedules, recognizing that elaborate wellness routines aren't practical for most women. Instead, focus on small, consistent actions that accumulate into significant health benefits over time.

> _DR VINCENT ASKEY, PAST PRESIDENT, AMERICAN MEDICAL ASSOCIATION_

**Quick Take**: Self-care isn't an indulgence—it's the foundation that enables you to effectively care for everyone and everything else.

### Money Matters: Financial Organization as Time Management
Financial disorganization creates significant time stress and mental burden. The book provides practical advice for organizing financial systems, reducing money-related anxiety, and creating efficient processes for bill payment, budgeting, and financial planning. When money matters are organized, they require less mental energy and create fewer urgent problems.

This includes setting up automated systems where possible, organizing important documents, creating efficient shopping and meal planning to reduce expenses, and teaching children about financial responsibility.

> _INDIRA GANDHI, PRIME MINISTER OF INDIA_
