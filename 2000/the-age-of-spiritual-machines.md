### Of Mind and Machines

The exploration of consciousness in machines through philosophical mind experiments encompasses a range of scenarios, from simple programs displaying messages to complex neural networks with human-like communication abilities. Central to these discussions is the vexing problem of whether machines can truly be considered conscious entities possessing free will, as understanding consciousness involves delving into subjective experiences.

In the realm of philosophy, various perspectives emerge. Logical positivists argue that consciousness is merely a machine reflecting on itself, potentially disregarding the significance of subjective experiences. On the other hand, the "consciousness is a different kind of stuff" school treats consciousness as a fundamental phenomenon, akin to basic particles and forces in the universe. There is also the intriguing notion proposed by the "we're too stupid" school, suggesting that human understanding may be inherently limited when grappling with the intricacies of consciousness.

To fully comprehend the nature of consciousness and free will, a synthesis of these diverse viewpoints may be necessary. Meanwhile, the Turing Test serves as a means to assess whether computers have achieved human-level intelligence, which Alan Turing associated with thinking and conscious intentionality. Though the initial predictions may have been overly optimistic regarding the timeframe for machine consciousness, they have not strayed too far from reality.

In exploring contrasting views of reality, the Western objective perspective posits that matter and energy's evolution led to the emergence of life. In contrast, the Eastern subjective view posits that consciousness preceded matter and energy, which are considered ideas of conscious beings. Quantum mechanics plays a pivotal role in reconciling these disparate viewpoints, suggesting an essential nexus between matter and consciousness. According to quantum theory, particles seem to exist retroactively only when observed by a conscious entity, implying the inseparability of matter and consciousness.

Turing's prediction that machines could eventually convince us of their consciousness and elicit empathy akin to conscious beings aligns with Marvin Minsky's Society of Mind concept. In this vision, the mind is depicted as a society of interacting minds, each harboring conflicting values and mixed emotions. However, the question of which minds within this societal model are genuinely conscious remains uncertain.

One of the challenges in understanding consciousness lies in the difficulty of scientifically measuring it, with the Turing Test being a human-centric attempt at evaluation. Furthermore, our subjective experience of time is intertwined with the speed of our objective processes, and altering our computational substrate can significantly influence our perception of time. These philosophical explorations continue to spark curiosity and inspire ongoing debates about the enigmatic nature of consciousness in machines and beyond.

The Law of Accelerating Returns predicts the exponential growth of computing power, making it possible to simulate human brain power in personal computers by 2020. It is estimated that supercomputers will reach the capacity of the human brain around 2010, and by 2023, a $1,000 device will match the memory capacity of the human brain.

Quantum computing, employing qu-bits, represents a more powerful approach than traditional digital computing, capable of solving problems that even massively parallel digital computers cannot handle. Quantum computers operate by presenting a problem and testing answers in a way that cancels out incorrect solutions, leaving only the correct one. Recent advances indicate that quantum computers are feasible, with experiments showing progress in building small-scale quantum computers using molecules and atoms.

In quantum computing, the focus is on massive redundancy rather than more massive parallelism. By leveraging the statistical behavior of trillions of molecules, quantum computers overcome the lack of reliability of a single molecule. This approach shares similarities with Professor Adleman's use of trillions of DNA strands in DNA computing. Quantum computing is particularly adept at mathematical proofs and creative tasks, such as creating art, but it may not have a significant advantage in board games.

However, quantum computing could easily crack encryption codes, although quantum encryption using entanglement offers unbreakable security. Roger Penrose's conjectures on quantum computing, human brains, and consciousness spark debates among experts.

Reverse engineering the human brain appears feasible through destructive and noninvasive brain scanning technologies. By scanning the brain's neural circuits, researchers can gain insights to design more intelligent machines based on the human brain's architecture and knowledge.

Brain scanning and mapping projects aim to understand the architecture and algorithms of interneuronal connections in different brain regions. The idea of scanning the brain to download its contents onto a neural computer becomes plausible with the precise mapping of neural components and connections. This process could create a new "person" with the same personality, history, and memory as the original scanned individual. However, the subjective question of whether the newly instantiated person possesses the same consciousness as the original raises significant challenges.

Neural implants are already in use to combat neurological and sensory afflictions, and their technology is expected to advance further in the future. As technology progresses, the boundary between humans and machines will blur, and brain-porting technology could potentially eliminate mortality as we know it. The fusion of human minds with intelligent technology is inevitable and holds immense potential for various aspects of life. Nevertheless, the question of whether the mental activity of neural implants is considered part of our own thinking or separate from our sense of self might lead to controversy.

The possibility of downloading memories and experiences opens up opportunities for individuals to share and partake in various events. However, crossing the human-machine divide and addressing the continuity of consciousness remains a complex issue that requires careful consideration and resolution.
