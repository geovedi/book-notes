# The Knowing-Doing Gap
**Authors**: Jeffrey Pfeffer, Robert I. Sutton | **Year**: 2000 | **Category**: Business & Finance

## Summary
"The Knowing-Doing Gap" tackles one of business's most perplexing problems: why organizations often know what to do but consistently fail to do it. The authors discovered that smart, well-intentioned managers frequently implement practices that undermine performance, despite having access to the right knowledge. Through extensive research across numerous companies, Pfeffer and Sutton identify the organizational barriers that prevent knowledge from turning into action and provide concrete examples of companies that successfully bridge this gap.

This book is essential for managers, executives, and business leaders who struggle with implementing change or find their organizations stuck in patterns of inaction. It offers practical insights for transforming knowledge into results, making it particularly valuable for those who have ever asked, "Why don't we do what we know we should do?"

## Core Insights

### The Knowing-Doing Gap Phenomenon
The book opens with a fundamental premise: knowing what to do is not enough to ensure it gets done. The authors observed countless organizations where leaders possessed sophisticated knowledge about effective management practices but failed to implement them. This gap between knowledge and action represents one of the most significant barriers to organizational performance. The problem isn't lack of knowledge—most managers can easily access best practices through books, consultants, or training. Instead, the issue lies in organizational systems and cultures that prevent action despite awareness of better alternatives.

> "So, it was clear that knowing what to do was not enough. It was clear that being smart was not enough to turn knowledge into practice."

**Quick Take**: Your organization's biggest challenge isn't acquiring more knowledge but creating conditions that translate existing knowledge into action.

### When Talk Substitutes for Action
One of the most pervasive barriers the authors identified is treating talk as equivalent to action. Many organizations mistakenly believe that discussing problems, writing plans, or analyzing data is the same as solving problems. Meetings about problems substitute for solving them. Presentations about strategies substitute for implementing them. This creates an illusion of productivity while preventing real progress. The authors observed firms that excelled at producing impressive documents and presentations but struggled with actual implementation.

> "ONE OF THE MAIN BARRIERS to turning knowledge into action is the tendency to treat talking about something as equivalent to actually doing something about it."

**Quick Take**: If your team spends more time discussing what needs to be done than actually doing it, you're caught in the talk-action trap.

### When Memory Substitutes for Thinking
Organizations often rely on past practices and precedents instead of thoughtful analysis of current situations. This "memory-based" approach leads companies to implement solutions that worked previously but may no longer be appropriate. The authors found that successful organizations encourage people to think critically about each situation rather than automatically applying past solutions. They create cultures where questioning established practices is encouraged rather than punished.

**Quick Take**: Past success doesn't guarantee future results. Encourage fresh thinking rather than automatic reliance on "how we've always done it."

### When Fear Prevents Acting on Knowledge
Fear is one of the most powerful barriers to turning knowledge into action. When employees fear punishment for mistakes, criticism for new ideas, or retaliation for challenging established practices, they naturally avoid taking risks—even when they know better approaches exist. The authors emphasize W. E. Deming's wisdom: "Drive out fear." Organizations that successfully bridge the knowing-doing gap create psychological safety where experimentation is encouraged and mistakes are treated as learning opportunities.

> "the wisdom of quality guru W. E. Deming's prescription for success: Drive out fear."

**Quick Take**: Fear creates organizational paralysis. If people are afraid to try new approaches, your best knowledge will remain unimplemented.

### When Measurement Obstructs Good Judgment
While measurement is essential for organizational performance, the authors found that many companies measure the wrong things or use measurements in ways that undermine good judgment. Effective organizations focus on measuring what truly matters and align their metrics with desired behaviors. They avoid measurement systems that encourage gaming the numbers rather than achieving actual results.

**Quick Take**: Measure what matters, not what's easy to count. Ensure your metrics encourage the behaviors you actually want.

### When Internal Competition Turns Friends into Enemies
Many organizations mistakenly believe that internal competition drives performance. However, the authors discovered that pitting employees or departments against each other often destroys collaboration and knowledge sharing. Companies that successfully implement knowledge create cultures of cooperation rather than internal warfare. They recognize that sustainable competitive advantage comes from collective effort, not internal battles.

**Quick Take**: Internal competition may feel motivating but often undermines the collaboration needed for effective implementation.

## Best Quotes
- "I wish we knew what we know at HP."
- "Drive out fear, if you want to motivate people and get them to act on what they know."
- "Talking about multidisciplinary teams is not enough."
- "The only true failure was to stop trying new things and to stop learning from the last effort to turn knowledge into action."
- "Sustainable competitive advantage is built by doing things that are difficult to imitate."

## Action Items
- **Audit your talk-to-action ratio**: Track how much time your team spends discussing versus implementing changes.
- **Create psychological safety**: Explicitly encourage experimentation and treat mistakes as learning opportunities.
- **Question precedents**: Regularly ask "Why do we do it this way?" and challenge the assumption that past practices are still appropriate.
- **Measure what matters**: Review your metrics to ensure they drive desired behaviors rather than unintended consequences.
- **Reduce internal competition**: Look for ways to increase collaboration across departments and teams.

## Questions to Consider
- What knowledge does your organization possess that isn't being implemented?
- Where does talk substitute for action in your company?
- How does fear influence decision-making and risk-taking in your organization?
- Are your measurement systems encouraging the behaviors you actually want?
- Is internal competition helping or hindering your ability to implement knowledge?

## Conclusion
"The Knowing-Doing Gap" is worth your time because it addresses a universal business problem that costs organizations billions in lost productivity and missed opportunities. The book's greatest strength lies in its practical approach—the authors don't just identify problems but provide concrete examples of companies that successfully bridge the gap between knowing and doing.

The biggest reason to read this book is that it offers a framework for understanding why your organization might be stuck despite having smart people and good ideas. Pfeffer and Sutton demonstrate that successful implementation isn't about having more knowledge but creating organizational systems that turn existing knowledge into action. Their insights are particularly valuable in today's fast-paced business environment, where the ability to execute effectively often separates successful companies from those that merely talk about success.

If you've ever been frustrated by your organization's inability to implement good ideas or if you're responsible for leading change initiatives, this book provides both the diagnostic tools to identify the barriers and practical strategies for overcoming them. It's a field guide for translating knowledge into results—arguably the most critical skill in modern business leadership.
