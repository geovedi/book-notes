  - A microprocessor is the "brain" of a computer, responsible for executing instructions and performing calculations.
  - Microprocessors are built from transistors, electronic components that can act as switches.
  - Early microprocessors like the Intel 4004 and 8008 had 4-bit data buses and limited capabilities.
  - The Intel 8080 was an 8-bit microprocessor with a 16-bit address bus, and it marked a significant advancement.
  - The memory microprocessors access is random access memory (RAM), and random access allows direct addressing.

- Random Access Memory (RAM)
  - RAM is like a book that can be opened to any page, unlike sequential access like microfilm or tapes.
  - RAM enables microprocessors to access any memory location using an address.

- Stack and Stack Memory
  - Stack is a form of storage that's neither random nor sequential, and it's used to keep track of jobs or data.
  - It's implemented as a last-in-first-out (LIFO) storage mechanism.
  - Computers use a stack for storing data or registers, using "push" to add data and "pop" to remove data.

- 8080 Microprocessor Stack
  - The 8080 microprocessor uses stack memory to push and pop data.
  - PUSH and POP instructions are used to manage data on the stack.
  - The Stack Pointer (SP) register keeps track of the current position of the stack.

- Interrupts and Control Flow
  - Microprocessors can receive interrupts from peripherals to handle external events.
  - Call and Return instructions allow subroutines to be implemented, saving and restoring program counters.
  - Conditional jump instructions enable branching based on flag conditions (e.g., Zero, Carry, Parity, etc.).
