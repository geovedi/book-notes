- Learning Morse code is easier when sending messages rather than receiving them.
- Deducing letters from a sequence of dots and dashes requires careful scrutiny of the translation table.
- The excerpt explores an alternative way of organizing Morse code, grouping them based on the number of dots and dashes.
- Organizing codes into tables based on the number of dots and dashes reveals a clear pattern: the number of codes is 2 raised to the power of the number of dots and dashes.
- The concept of a "big treelike table" visually displays letters corresponding to specific sequences of dots and dashes, making decoding easier.
- Morse code can be expanded to include numbers and punctuation marks by using five and six dots and dashes, respectively.
- The binary nature of Morse code, using only two components (dots and dashes), is similar to a coin landing on heads or tails.
- Combinatorial analysis, a branch of mathematics, helps in understanding the various ways codes can be combined and deconstructed.
- Morse code provides essential insights into the world of codes, communication systems, and computer technology.

## Braille and Binary Codes
- Louis Braille created the Braille code, the first system of raised dots for written language, about 18 years after Samuel Morse developed Morse code.
- Braille became blind at three years old due to a tragic accident, but his potential was recognized, leading to his education at the Royal Institution for Blind Youth in Paris.
- Charles Barbier's "night writing," a system of raised dots and dashes on paper, inspired Braille, who refined it into the Braille code over three years.
- The Braille code uses raised dots arranged within a two-by-three cell, with each dot representing a binary element, similar to Morse code.
- Braille's original system had 64 codes, each representing a unique character, but Grade 2 Braille employs contractions for efficiency.
- The Braille code accommodates letters, numbers, punctuation marks, capitalization indicators, and uses shift and escape codes for more efficient representation of written language.
- Braille's system brings accessibility and empowerment to the blind community, allowing them to read and write literature and information like anyone else.
- Braille's ingenuity and brilliance forever changed the way the blind interact with written language, leaving a lasting impact on the world.

## Anatomy of a Flashlight
- Flashlights have versatile uses beyond reading under covers or sending coded messages.
- Disassembling a flashlight reveals a simple construction with batteries, a bulb, a switch, metal pieces, and a plastic case.
- An electrical circuit is a circular path, and a switch controls whether the lightbulb glows by completing or interrupting the circuit.
- Electricity involves the movement of electrons, which can be dislodged from atoms under certain circumstances.
- Batteries generate electricity through chemical reactions, creating an excess of electrons at the negative terminal and a demand for electrons at the positive terminal.
- Materials like copper, silver, and gold are conductors, while rubber or plastic are insulators.
- Voltage represents the potential for work, current is the flow of electrons, and resistance determines how much a substance impedes electron flow.
- Connecting batteries in series adds their voltages, while connecting them in parallel preserves voltage but increases current capacity.
- An incandescent lightbulb's resistance generates heat and light when electricity flows through it.
- Switches control the flow of electricityâ€”closed switches allow flow (on), and open switches block it (off).
- The simplicity of a flashlight's binary nature (on or off) resembles binary codes used by Morse and Braille.
- Understanding electrical circuits and their applications is essential for comprehending computers and technology.

## Seeing Around Corners
- You are twelve years old, and your best friend moves away, prompting you to build a telegraph system to continue your late-night Morse code conversations with your new best friend next door.
- To create your two-way telegraph, you use batteries, lightbulbs, switches, and wires to build flashlights that can transmit Morse code messages.
- By using a common connection (earth or ground), you reduce the number of wires needed between your houses and allow the flow of electrons for communication.
- The common connection acts as a massive conductor, enabling you to communicate around corners and over long distances by extending the wires.
- Longer wires result in increased resistance, leading to dimmer lightbulbs and weaker signals. You experiment with thicker wires and higher-voltage batteries to maintain reliability.
- Despite improvements, you still face limitations similar to early telegraph systems, which could only span a few hundred miles.
- Hints at a simple and humble device on the horizon that will revolutionize communication and lay the foundation for the creation of entire computers.

## Telegraphs and Relays
- In the early 1800s, long-distance communication was slow and unreliable, relying on methods like semaphore codes or waving flags on hills.
- Samuel Finley Breese Morse, born in 1791, invented the telegraph and Morse code, changing the course of history.
- Morse's brilliance lay in his use of electromagnetism, utilizing an electromagnet to attract iron pieces when a current passed through a wire wrapped around it.
- Morse code, using dots and dashes, allowed messages to be sent and received over long distances.
- The first public demonstration of the telegraph was on May 24, 1844, when the message "What hath God wrought!" was sent from Washington, D.C., to Baltimore, Maryland.
- The telegraph key was used to send messages, producing dots and dashes based on the duration it was held down, and the sounder translated them into audible clicks and clacks at the receiving end.
- Resistance in long wires limited the system's reach, but the invention of the relay, which amplified weak incoming signals, extended the telegraph's capabilities.
- The relay's potential sparked curiosity about other possibilities, ultimately paving the way for the development of computers.
- Before diving into computer technology, there was one essential skill to learn: counting.

## Our Ten Digits
- Numbers are like a universal language, with the written representation remaining consistent and easily understood worldwide.
- The abstract nature of numbers makes it challenging to comprehend that the same quantity can be denoted by different symbols in different languages.
- The base-ten number system is widely used, but there's nothing inherently special about the number ten; it's a result of early humans counting on their fingers.
- Powers of ten, like a decade, a century, or a millennium, are assigned special significance in our culture.
- Roman numerals, while still used decoratively, are cumbersome for multiplication and division.
- The Hindu-Arabic number system, brought to Europe by Arab mathematicians, revolutionized mathematics with its positional nature.
- The positional nature of the Hindu-Arabic system makes it easy to represent large numbers and perform arithmetic operations.
- The inclusion of zero in the Hindu-Arabic system is a crucial invention that profoundly impacted mathematics.
- Using the Hindu-Arabic system, numbers can be broken down into components, making arithmetic operations systematic and manageable.
- The adaptability of the Hindu-Arabic system allows for different numbering systems, such as base eight for cartoon characters with four fingers.
- The concepts of positional notation and place value apply universally, enabling us to appreciate and understand the significance of numbers across different cultures and contexts.

## Alternatives to Ten
- The decimal number system is based on ten digits, reflecting the number of fingers and toes humans possess.
- Alternative number systems like octal (base eight) could exist if humans had a different number of fingers.
- In the octal system, we count from 0 to 7 before running out of symbols, just like in the decimal system (0 to 9).
- The octal number 10 doesn't represent ten fingers; it represents the number of fingers cartoon characters have (four on each hand).
- Each position in an octal number represents a digit multiplied by a power of eight.
- The quaternary system (base four) would be suitable for creatures like lobsters that have pincers on their two front legs.
- In the quaternary system, we count from 0 to 3 before running out of symbols.
- The binary system (base two) is the most extreme alternative, with only two digits: 0 and 1.
- Binary numbers are essential in understanding computers, which operate with electrical switches that represent binary digits (0 and 1).
- The term "bit" was introduced by mathematician John Wilder Tukey to refer to a binary digit.
- Different number systems like octal, quaternary, and binary provide insights into the fundamentals of arithmetic and their connection to computer technology.

## Bit by Bit by Bit
- Bits are the fundamental building blocks of information in the digital realm, representing a choice between 0 and 1.
- We draw parallels with using a yellow ribbon to convey a yes or no message and apply this concept to binary numbers, the simplest number system.
- Binary numbers are the foundation of computer systems, making them powerful and easy to work with.
- Bits can represent choices and are essential in digital communication.
- Redundancy in communication is valuable, as seen in Paul Revere's lantern signals and Siskel and Ebert's movie reviews.

- Universal Product Codes (UPCs) encode information with bits and include error-checking mechanisms.
- Decoding UPCs may seem complex, but the information they convey is often mundane, similar to printed numbers on packages.
- Understanding redundancy and error-checking is crucial for reliable and accurate data transmission in various systems.

## Logic and Switches
- Aristotle's teachings in the Organon, dating back to the fourth century B.C.E., explored the concept of logic as a means of analyzing language in the search for truth, considered a form of philosophy by the ancient Greeks.
- Aristotle's logic was based on syllogisms, with the famous example being "All men are mortal; Socrates is a man; Hence, Socrates is mortal."
- Mathematicians struggled for over two thousand years to formalize Aristotle's logic using mathematical symbols and operators, with Gottfried Wilhelm von Leibniz being one of the few who came close before the nineteenth century.
- George Boole, born in 1815, made a significant breakthrough in mathematical logic by inventing Boolean algebra, a type of algebra where operands refer to classes rather than numbers.
- Boolean algebra paved the way for representing logic and mathematical concepts using switches and electrical circuits.
- Boole introduced the concepts of union (+, OR) and intersection (x, AND) symbols in Boolean algebra, enabling the expression of complex logical operations.
- Examples of Boolean algebra expressions include "M x N x (W + T)" representing a neutered male cat that is either white or tan.
- Boole's work eventually led to the development of computers that utilize binary numbers and perform logical operations using switches and circuits.
- Boole's genius was not fully recognized in his time, but his work laid the foundation for the digital age and our modern understanding of logic and computing.

## Gates (Not Bill)
- Logic gates in computing are named due to their resemblance to ordinary gates that control the flow of water or people. In logic, these gates allow or block the flow of electrical current, performing simple tasks.
- Claude Elwood Shannon's breakthrough in the 1930s revealed that electrical circuits could directly represent Boolean expressions, allowing electrical engineers to efficiently design circuits with switches using Boolean algebra.
- The example of selecting a specific cat in a pet shop using Boolean expressions and switches can be simplified using associative and distributive laws to reduce the number of switches required.
- Ideally, a circuit with four switches (bits) can represent the desired cat's attributes, with one switch for sex, one for neutered status, and two for the cat's color (2 bits for four colors).
- Electrical engineers combine relays to create logic gates, with the four basic gates being AND, OR, NOT (inverter), and NAND gates, which can perform more complex tasks.
- Complex circuits, like the 2-Line-to-4-Line Decoder, can be built by connecting these basic gates.
- The NOR and NAND gates are equivalent to AND gates with inverted inputs and OR gates with inverted inputs, respectively, according to De Morgan's Laws.
- Using logic gates, electrical engineers can simplify Boolean expressions and circuits, facilitating the design and implementation of complex systems, such as adding machines.

## A Binary Adding Machine
- Understanding addition is crucial for understanding almost all computer operations, leading to more complex computations.
- The adding machine we construct is a relatively simple device using electrical components and binary numbers as its foundation.
- Binary numbers, consisting of 0s and 1s, will be used exclusively in our adding machine, with input through switches and output displayed using lightbulbs.
- Binary addition uses a much simpler table compared to decimal addition, with just four operations: 0+0=0, 0+1=1, 1+0=1, and 1+1=0 (with a carry of 1).
- We design a circuit with XOR and AND gates to perform sum and carry operations, respectively, and create a Half Adder for adding two binary digits.
- The Full Adder, incorporating the carry bit from previous additions, becomes the building block of our 8-bit adding machine.
- The 8-Bit Adder consists of eight Full Adders wired together, allowing us to add binary numbers up to 8 bits long (0 to 255 in decimal).
- The control panel has two rows of eight switches for the input numbers and a row of nine lightbulbs to display the result (accounting for the possibility of a 9-bit sum).
- The 8-Bit Adder comprises 144 relays and serves as a foundation for understanding modern computers that use transistors to perform logic functions at a much faster and smaller scale.

## But What About Subtraction?
- Binary subtraction differs from addition and requires the mechanism of borrowing.
- To perform subtraction without borrowing, we use the nines' complement of the subtrahend.
- Adding the nines' complement to the minuend and then adjusting the result yields the correct subtraction.
- The nines' complement simplifies binary subtraction by avoiding the need for borrowing.
- When the subtrahend is larger than the minuend, we switch the two numbers, use the nines' complement, and negate the result to get the correct answer.
- Ten's complement allows representation of negative numbers without negative signs, simplifying addition by following the same rules for positive and negative values.
- In binary numbers, the two's complement system is analogous to ten's complement for decimals, using the most significant bit as the sign bit.
- Two's complement allows easy addition of positive and negative numbers using only the rules of addition.
- Overflow and underflow conditions must be considered in binary arithmetic to prevent incorrect results when the result exceeds the allowed range of values.
- Proper handling of overflow and underflow is necessary to ensure accurate computations.

- R-S flip-flops have two inputs and two outputs, making them suitable for memory applications.
- D-type flip-flops can "latch" onto data and retain it until triggered by a Clock signal, useful for storing intermediate values and facilitating counting operations.
- Connecting an oscillator to a flip-flop as feedback creates a frequency divider, halving the oscillator's frequency to count in binary numbers.
- 8-bit counters can be constructed using frequency dividers, counting from 0 to 255.
- Enhanced flip-flops with preset and clear inputs become more sophisticated and versatile, allowing direct control of the flip-flop's output.

## Bytes and Hex
- The term "byte" originated at IBM in the 1950s and evolved to signify a group of 8 bits by the mid-1960s.
- A byte can represent values from 00000000 to 11111111, corresponding to positive integers from 0 to 255 or both positive and negative integers from -128 to 127 using two's complement.
- The byte size of 8 bits turned out to be ideal for various purposes, such as storing numbers in Binary-Coded Decimal (BCD) format, representing most written languages, and displaying shades in black-and-white photographs.
- Representing byte values in binary can be cumbersome, so hexadecimal notation is often used. In hexadecimal, each digit corresponds to 4 bits or 1 nibble, making it more concise when representing bytes.
- Converting between binary, hexadecimal, and decimal can be useful in computer programming and data representation, with straightforward techniques for conversion. Binary to hexadecimal conversion is relatively simple, while decimal to hexadecimal may require more effort.

## An Assemblage of Memory
