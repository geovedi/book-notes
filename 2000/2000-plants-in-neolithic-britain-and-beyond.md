# Plants in Neolithic Britain and Beyond
**Authors**: Alasdair Whittle (editor), Michael J. Allen, Mark A. Robinson, and others | **Year**: 2000

## Summary
"Plants in Neolithic Britain and Beyond" presents a comprehensive examination of plant use, cultivation, and landscape management during the Neolithic period in Britain and continental Europe. Through multiple scholarly contributions, the book challenges traditional views of Neolithic agriculture by revealing the complex relationship between humans, plants, and their environment during this transformative period.

This scholarly collection offers profound insights for archaeologists, environmental historians, and anyone interested in understanding how early farming societies shaped and were shaped by their plant-based economies. Readers will discover groundbreaking perspectives on Neolithic life, from the symbolic significance of cereals to the environmental impact of early land management practices.

## Core Insights

### The Taskscape Revolution
The book introduces Ingold's concept of the "taskscape" to Neolithic studies - the routine, lived-in world of experience, habit, and knowledge that characterized how Neolithic people interacted with plants. This approach moves beyond simply cataloguing what plants were used to understanding how plant cultivation and harvesting shaped daily life, social relationships, and cultural practices.

### Diversity Over Uniformity
Perhaps the most striking picture to emerge is that of diversity in Neolithic plant use. Rather than a uniform agricultural revolution, the evidence points to varied approaches across different regions and time periods. Some communities emphasized cereal cultivation, while others relied heavily on wild plant resources, suggesting multiple pathways to Neolithic life.

### Landscape as Living Environment
The book challenges traditional archaeological approaches by emphasizing that landscape should not be viewed as merely a container for human activity but as an integral part of lived experience. Environmental archaeology reveals that Neolithic people actively created and modified their environments through woodland clearance, cultivation, and grazing practices.

### The Symbolic Power of Cereals
Beyond their nutritional value, cereals likely held significant symbolic and social importance in Neolithic societies. The book explores how cereal cultivation may have represented cultural identity and social distinction, serving as markers of "culture" in opposition to "nature."

### Environmental Impact and Adaptation
Neolithic land management practices had significant environmental consequences, including soil erosion, deforestation, and changes in biodiversity. The book provides detailed evidence of how early farming activities transformed the British landscape over centuries of continuous occupation.

## Best Quotes
- "Perhaps the most striking picture to emerge is that of diversity. There is a central debate (crudely, Jones versus Robinson) between the view, on the one hand, that cereals were both more important than wild plants and were of central importance in the Neolithic diet overall, and the view, on the other hand, that cereals were frequently matched by or overtaken in importance by wild plants."

- "Context is everything; the diagram expanded in one direction of household-based production, and in another of more communal activity, and much depends on the goals of production."

- "The dwelling perspective' would suggest otherwise; people should be seen as 'beings immersed from the start, like other creatures, in an active, practical and perceptual engagement with constituents of the dwelt-in world'."

- "It is time to attempt more detailed socialisation of the whole process of growing, tending, harvesting, treating, storing and consuming cereals and other plants."

## Action Items
- **For Archaeologists**: Incorporate environmental and plant-based evidence more systematically into site interpretations and regional studies
- **For Environmental Historians**: Consider Neolithic land management practices as foundational moments in long-term environmental change
- **For Museum Professionals**: Develop exhibits that showcase the diversity of Neolithic plant use beyond just cereal cultivation
- **For Educators**: Emphasize the complexity and regional variation in Neolithic agriculture rather than presenting it as a uniform revolution
- **For Researchers**: Prioritize high-resolution, multi-method approaches to landscape reconstruction

## Questions to Consider
- How did Neolithic people conceptualize the relationship between cultivated plants and wild vegetation?
- What role did gender and age play in different aspects of plant cultivation and processing?
- How can we better integrate symbolic and practical interpretations of plant use in archaeological analysis?
- What can Neolithic approaches to plant management teach us about sustainable agriculture today?
- How might diversity in Neolithic plant use reflect different cultural or ethnic groups within Britain?

## Conclusion
This collection is essential reading for anyone seeking a nuanced understanding of Neolithic Britain. Its greatest contribution is moving beyond simplistic models of agricultural revolution to reveal the complex, diverse ways that early farming communities interacted with their plant environment. The book succeeds admirably in showing how plant-based evidence can transform our understanding of prehistoric life, from daily routines to symbolic beliefs.

The biggest reason to read this work is its methodological innovation - demonstrating how environmental archaeology, when combined with traditional approaches, can reveal the richness and diversity of Neolithic life. While technically detailed, its insights about human-environment relationships resonate far beyond archaeological specialization, offering fresh perspectives on how societies adapt to and shape their natural surroundings.
