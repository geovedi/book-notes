## Core Insights

### The Living Nature of Myth

Classical mythology wasn't static entertainment but dynamic cultural history for the Greeks. These stories were considered factual accounts of their heroic past, with genealogies showing people's place in the world and connection to divine ancestors. As Jennifer March explains, "Moreover these myths were more than mere stories. To the Greeks they were history, telling of real events in their heroic past, while a man's genealogy, often originating from a divine mythical ancestor, showed his place in the world and his relation to the great heroes of myth."

> "The question of how far the myths are based on fact is a difficult one, and there is no generally agreed answer, nor ever likely to be. My own belief is that the myths have a core of truth."
> _Original: English_

**Quick Take**: Understanding myths as cultural history rather than mere fiction reveals their deeper significance to ancient societies.

### The Dual Sources: Literary and Visual

Our knowledge comes from two complementary streams: abundant literary texts (Homer, Hesiod, tragedians, Ovid) and rich visual evidence (especially Greek vase-paintings). These sources often fill gaps in each other, with art sometimes preserving mythological details lost to literature. The dictionary uniquely integrates both perspectives, showing how ancient artists visualized these stories and which myths were most popular across different periods.

> "There is space here to do no more than touch on the various ways in which we can learn more about the myths from ancient art – and always remembering, when making any generalisation, that we possess only a tiny fraction of the works that were actually created."
> _Original: English_

**Quick Take**: Visual evidence provides crucial context and details missing from literary sources, offering a more complete picture of ancient mythology.

### The Cultural Transmission from Greece to Rome

Roman culture didn't just preserve Greek myths—they transformed and reinterpreted them. The process created what we call "Classical Mythology," a synthesis that transmitted these stories to the postclassical world. As the author notes, "Captured Greece took captive her savage conqueror," with Roman poets like Virgil and Ovid creating influential adaptations that became standard versions for later generations.

> "Rome itself, expanding in power and prestige, early came into contact with Greek culture, so that by the time the Romans won a final military victory over Greece in 146 BC, their own culture had for centuries been deeply permeated by Greek literature, Greek thought, and Greek myths."
> _Original: English_

**Quick Take**: The Roman adaptation of Greek mythology created the foundation of Western mythological tradition.

### Understanding Ancient Values Through Modern Eyes

The dictionary guides readers through the moral landscape of ancient mythology, warning against judging these stories by modern standards. Themes like divine rape, revenge, and heroism must be understood in their original cultural context. What seems brutal to us was often honorable or necessary in ancient worldview.

> "All this is to say that, when we enter the world of myth, we must come, as best we can, with a mind open to what may at first seem alien. The myths are another country. They do things differently here."
> _Original: English_

**Quick Take**: Ancient mythology requires cultural empathy to understand rather than modern judgment.

### The Enduring Artistic Inspiration

Classical myths possess unique power to inspire creative work across centuries. From medieval manuscript illuminations to Renaissance paintings to modern literature, these stories remain fertile ground for artistic exploration. The dictionary traces this continuous inspiration, showing how each generation reinterprets these timeless narratives.

> "Another crucial characteristic of classical myths is their perennial power to inspire great art and great poetry, both in ancient times and down the ages."
> _Original: English_

**Quick Take**: The artistic adaptability of classical myths ensures their continued relevance in contemporary culture.
