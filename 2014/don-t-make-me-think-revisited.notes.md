# Don't Make Me Think, Revisited
Author: Steve Krug

## Guiding Principles
### Don't Make Me Think!
- **Krug's First Law of Usability:**
  - The most important principle for making a site or app easy to use is "Don't make me think!"
  - It's about creating designs that are self-evident, obvious, and require minimal effort to understand and use.
  - The goal is to eliminate cognitive load and unnecessary question marks from users' minds.
- **Examples of Things to Avoid:**
  - **Non-Clickable Elements:** Links and buttons that aren't obviously clickable should be avoided as they create confusion and cognitive workload.
  - **Unnecessary Thinking:** Users shouldn't need to think about things like names, important page elements, or whether something is an ad.
  - **Cognitive Workload:** Each question mark adds to cognitive workload, making the experience less enjoyable and effective.
- **Importance of Self-Evident Design:**
  - Design should aim for self-evident or self-explanatory pages.
  - Self-explanatory pages may require a bit of thought but should still convey understanding effortlessly.
  - Creating such designs enhances user experience, saves time, and reduces frustration.
- **User Behavior and Effective Design:**
  - People spend less time on pages than designers imagine.
  - Effective designs must capture users' attention and convey information quickly.
  - Self-evident designs enable users to grasp key information at a glance, ensuring their efficiency and effectiveness.

### How We Really Use the Web
- **Web User Behavior and Design Realities:**
  - Users don't read pages; they scan them for relevant information.
  - People are on a mission when using the web, often seeking quick results.
  - Users focus on bits that match their interests or tasks, ignoring the rest.
- **Satisficing and Decision Making:**
  - Users satisfice, choosing the first reasonable option instead of the best.
  - Time constraints and efficiency play a significant role in decision-making.
  - Guessing is more common, as the penalty for wrong guesses is usually minimal.
- **Muddling Through and Understanding:**
  - Users muddle through technology without fully understanding how things work.
  - People often use tools successfully even without grasping their full functionality.
  - Lack of understanding is due to not caring rather than a lack of intelligence.
- **Importance of User Understanding:**
  - While users can muddle through, understanding matters for efficiency and accuracy.
  - Understanding leads to better navigation, finding desired content, and feeling in control.
  - Designing for user understanding increases the likelihood of returning users and site success.

### Billboard Design 101
- **Optimizing Web Pages for Quick Understanding:**
  - Design for scanning, not reading, due to users' fast browsing behavior.
  - Utilize existing conventions for easy recognition and navigation.
  - Create effective visual hierarchies to highlight important elements.
- **Enhancing User Interaction:**
  - Break pages into clear areas to facilitate quick navigation.
  - Ensure clickable elements are visually distinct and recognizable.
  - Minimize visual noise to maintain user focus and clarity.
- **Formatting Text for Scanning:**
  - Use headings effectively to provide an outline and guide for readers.
  - Keep paragraphs short to prevent overwhelming text blocks.
  - Employ bulleted lists for easier scanning of series or items.
  - Highlight key terms to aid users in identifying relevant content.

### Animal, Vegetable, or Mineral?
- **Simplifying User Choices:**
  - Users prefer mindless, clear choices over complex decision-making.
  - Number of clicks matters less than ease of each click and clarity of options.
  - Users follow the "scent of information" for painless navigation.
- **Clear vs. Unclear Choices:**
  - Links with unambiguous targets provide confidence and clarity.
  - Poorly worded links create uncertainty and hinder navigation.
  - Easy choices require minimal thought, enhancing user experience.
- **Challenges with Complex Choices:**
  - Users struggle with unclear or difficult choices, causing frustration.
  - Designers should provide necessary guidance for tough decisions.
  - Guidance should be brief, timely, and unavoidable to aid users.
- **Effective Just-in-Time Guidance:**
  - Brief, timely, and unavoidable guidance assists users in complex situations.
  - Examples include form field tips, "What's this?" links, and tool tips.
  - London street corner signs as an illustration of successful just-in-time guidance.
- **Simplification for User Experience:**
  - Making choices mindless is crucial for enhancing website usability.
  - Web users constantly face decisions, so streamlining choices is vital for user satisfaction.

### Omit Needless Words
- **Concise Writing for Web Pages:**
  - Krug's Third Law emphasizes cutting down words for better usability.
  - E. B. White's rule of omitting needless words promotes concise, effective writing.
  - Most web pages contain unnecessary words that deter readability.
- **Benefits of Trimming Words:**
  - Removing unnecessary words improves page noise level.
  - Highlights valuable content and reduces visual clutter.
  - Shorter pages allow users to grasp more content without scrolling.
- **Reducing "Happy Talk":**
  - "Happy talk" is promotional text with no useful information.
  - It often appears in introductory sections, conveying self-congratulatory messages.
  - Eliminating happy talk enhances user experience and gets to the point quickly.
- **Minimizing Instructions:**
  - Instructions are often ignored or misunderstood by users.
  - Aim to make content self-explanatory to eliminate instructions.
  - If necessary, keep instructions concise and straightforward.
- **Transition to Navigation and Home Page:**
  - Earlier principles lead into the challenges of navigation and Home page design.
  - Next chapters delve into these significant aspects of web design.

## Things You Need to Get Right
### Street Signs and Breadcrumbs
- **Web Navigation Principles:**
  - Clear and prominent visual cues are essential for effective navigation.
  - Users often overlook subtle visual cues, so make them more prominent.
  - Breadcrumbs are useful indicators that show users their location in the site hierarchy.
  - Breadcrumbs should be placed at the top of the page, using ">" as separators.
  - The last item in breadcrumbs should be bold and represent the current page.
  - Tabs are a valuable navigation choice due to their self-evident, hard-to-miss nature.
  - Active tabs need distinct colors and physical connection to stand out.
  - A successful navigation should pass the "trunk test," ensuring clear understanding.
- **Challenges and Realities of Web Navigation:**
  - Users often arrive at pages through search engines or other external links.
  - Designers must account for users dropped into the middle of a site without context.
  - The "trunk test" evaluates navigation clarity without close scrutiny.
  - Navigation elements should stand out even with a slightly blurry vision.
- **Testing and Implementation:**
  - Apply the "trunk test" to random pages to assess navigation effectiveness.
  - Circulate key navigation elements such as site ID, page name, sections, local navigation, "You are here" indicators, and search.
  - Get feedback from friends to gauge the success of your site's navigation.

### The Big Bang Theory of Web Design
- **Designing an Effective Home Page:**
  - Designing a Home page is like a game show challenge, with unexpected elements.
  - The Home page must convey site identity, hierarchy, search, teasers, timely content, deals, shortcuts, and registration.
  - Abstract goals include showing what users are looking for, guiding them where to start, and establishing credibility.
- **Challenges of Home Page Design:**
  - The Home page accommodates numerous elements, often in limited space.
  - Space constraints lead to conflicts among stakeholders for Home page visibility.
  - The Home page aims to appeal to diverse visitors, making design compromises.
  - Compromises in design can lead to loss of conveying the big picture.
- **Importance of Clear Communication:**
  - Users often visit the Home page for orientation and understanding.
  - Users form quick impressions upon opening a page, influencing their interpretation.
  - Misunderstandings in initial assumptions can lead to further misinterpretations.
  - The Home page needs to convey the big picture, even under time constraints.
- **Key Elements for Conveying Site Purpose:**
  - The tagline, placed near the Site ID, succinctly characterizes the site's purpose.
  - The Welcome blurb provides a brief site description in a prominent location.
  - Short explanatory videos help clarify complex propositions.
  - These elements serve as anchors for users seeking to understand the site's purpose.
- **Optimizing Entry Points and Navigation:**
  - Users should quickly identify where to start for searching, browsing, or sampling content.
  - Step-by-step process entry points and registration/sign-in areas need prominence.
  - Cluttered Home pages hinder user orientation and entry point identification.
- **Balancing Priorities and Avoiding Overload:**
  - Home pages are susceptible to shortsighted behavior, promoting everything at once.
  - Promotions on the Home page attract traffic but contribute to clutter.
  - Adding more elements to the Home page diminishes overall effectiveness.
  - The tragedy of the commons concept appliesâ€”shared resources deteriorate when overused.
  - Regular vigilance is necessary to prevent Home page overload.

## Making Sure You Got Them Right
### "The Farmer and the Cowman Should Be Friends"
- **Challenges of Usability Debates:**
