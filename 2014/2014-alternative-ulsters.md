## Core Insights

### The Hierarchy of Identity
The book builds on poet John Hewitt's concept of a "hierarchy of values" in identity - being Ulsterman, Irishman, British, and European simultaneously. Many interviewees express this layered sense of belonging, suggesting identity exists on multiple levels rather than as a single choice.

> "I'm an Ulsterman, of planter stock. I was born in the island of Ireland, so secondarily I'm an Irishman. I was born in the British archipelago and English is my native tongue, so I'm British. The British archipelago consists of offshore islands to the continent of Europe, so I'm European."
> _Original: "I'm an Ulsterman, of planter stock. I was born in the island of Ireland, so secondarily I'm an Irishman. I was born in the British archipelago and English is my native tongue, so I'm British. The British archipelago consists of offshore islands to the continent of Europe, so I'm European."_

**Quick Take**: Identity can be inclusive rather than exclusive - multiple layers of belonging can coexist without contradiction.

### The Rise of "Northern Irish" Identity
A significant finding is the growing acceptance of "Northern Irish" as a legitimate identity category, particularly among those who prioritize political stability over traditional nationalist or unionist labels. This represents a shift toward a more regional understanding of belonging.

> "When I tick a box that says I am Northern Irish, I am saying that my strongest identification is with this region and its people and that I want political stability here in a Northern Ireland that is connected to Ireland, Britain and Europe."

**Quick Take**: Shared regional identity can transcend historical divisions and provide a foundation for political compromise.

### Identity as Contextual Performance
Many interviewees reveal that their sense of identity changes depending on where they are and who they're with. This challenges the notion of identity as a fixed characteristic and highlights its performative aspects.

**Quick Take**: Our identity is not just who we are, but how we present ourselves in different contexts and relationships.

### Surprising Commonalities Across Divides
The interviews uncover unexpected connections and friendships across traditional divides, suggesting that personal relationships often transcend political labels. Examples include loyalist Jackie McDonald's friendship with former Irish President Mary McAleese.

**Quick Take**: Human connection and personal relationships can bridge political divides more effectively than ideological arguments.

### The Changing Nature of Ulster
The book documents how Ulster is evolving beyond the traditional Protestant-Catholic binary to include diverse communities from Portugal, Poland, and various faith traditions including Islam, Hinduism, and Bahá'í.

**Quick Take**: Regions are not static - cultural diversity is reshaping even the most traditionally divided societies.
