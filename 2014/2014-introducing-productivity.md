# Introducing Productivity
**Authors**: Graham Allcott | **Year**: 2014

## Summary
"Introducing Productivity" is a practical A-to-Z guide that transforms how you think about getting things done in the modern workplace. Allcott argues that traditional time management is dead—what truly matters is managing your attention, the most limited and valuable resource you have. The book introduces the CORD Productivity Model (Capture and Collect, Organize, Review, Do) and the "Productivity Ninja" mindset to help you navigate information overload, reduce stress, and achieve more with less effort.

This guide is perfect for busy professionals, knowledge workers, and anyone feeling overwhelmed by their workload who wants a quick reference of practical productivity techniques they can implement immediately.

## Core Insights

### Attention Management Over Time Management
The foundation of modern productivity is recognizing that attention is more limited than time. You can't manage time, but you can optimize how you direct your attention across three levels: proactive attention (when you're fully focused and ready for complex tasks), active attention (when you're competently engaged), and inactive attention (when you're fatigued and mentally foggy). The key is matching task complexity to your attention level and protecting your proactive attention like the precious resource it is.

> "Pay attention. Wisely. Time might be spent, but attention still needs to be paid. Look after this currency, as it's the most valuable currency in the world."

**Quick Take**: Schedule your most challenging work during your peak attention periods and save low-energy tasks for when your attention is lagging.

### The CORD Productivity Model
This four-stage framework transforms how you handle information and tasks. First, **Capture and Collect**—get everything out of your head and into a trusted system. Second, **Organize**—process each item by asking "What's the next physical action?" to turn vague worries into concrete steps. Third, **Review**—regularly assess your progress and adjust your approach. Finally, **Do**—execute your plans with focused attention. The strength of your productivity depends on all four links in this chain.

> "What you're really paid for is the thinking process that goes on. After all, anyone could type and send that final email if they were told exactly what to say!"

**Quick Take**: Create a "second brain" outside your head to store commitments, then consistently process each item to clarify your next physical action.

### The Productivity Ninja Mindset
Adopt nine characteristics that transform how you work: maintain **Zen-like Calm** under pressure, be **Ruthless** in protecting your attention, stay **Weapon-savvy** with the right tools, use **Stealth** to avoid distractions, embrace **Unorthodoxy** to find better ways, remain **Agile** in response to change, practice **Mindfulness** about your thought processes, stay **Prepared** for opportunities, and accept that you're human, not a superhero. This mindset helps you make better decisions and adapt to new challenges.

> "When the enemy is information overload, stress, tiredness, having too much to do and feeling overwhelmed by the requests and expectations of others, do you want to surrender and be a victim? Or do you want to be a Productivity Ninja?"

**Quick Take**: Focus on developing one Ninja characteristic at a time rather than trying to perfect all nine simultaneously.

### Email and Meeting Mastery
Transform how you handle communication by treating your inbox as a processing station, not a storage facility. Aim for "Inbox Zero" by deciding immediately what each email means (delete, delegate, defer, or do). For meetings, always clarify the purpose and desired outcomes beforehand, keep them focused and time-bound, and end with clear action items. Poor email and meeting habits are often the biggest drains on productive attention.

> "Your job as a knowledge worker is to deliver the right outcomes and information. What you're paid to do is work out what the job is, how it should look, how to go about it, and so on."

**Quick Take**: Process email in batches during your lower-attention periods and protect your high-energy time for focused work.

### Habits, Procrastination, and Energy Management
Productivity ultimately comes down to building the right habits and managing your energy, not just your time. Use techniques like the "two-minute rule" for overcoming procrastination, implement kitchen timers for focused work sessions, and pay attention to how nutrition, rest, and movement affect your attention levels. The key is creating systems that work with your natural tendencies rather than against them.

> "A Ninja is a human being, with all the foibles and imperfections that we humans have. We can improve, we can do our best and increase productivity to levels that make us seem like we're productivity superheroes, but we're still prone to the odd moment of making the wrong decision or screwing things up."

**Quick Take**: Start small with habit changes and focus on consistency rather than perfection.
