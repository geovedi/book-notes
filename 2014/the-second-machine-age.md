## The Big Stories

Human history is marked by numerous important developments, though determining the most significant ones is challenging due to various factors like defining the starting point of "human history" and the criteria for importance. Some key milestones include the migration of Homo sapiens from Africa approximately 60,000 years ago, the extinction of Neanderthals and other hominids by 25,000 BCE, and the advent of agriculture around 8,000 BCE. The domestication of animals, especially horses and oxen, played a crucial role in the transition from foraging to farming, facilitating the growth of human settlements and cities.

Additionally, the rise of empires like the Mongol, Roman, Arab, and Ottoman empires, along with the emergence of major religions such as Buddhism, Confucianism, Hinduism, Judaism, Christianity, and Islam, shaped the course of human history. Another pivotal innovation was the invention of writing, believed to have originated in Mesopotamia around 3,200 BCE, fundamentally transforming human communication and knowledge dissemination.

Arguably, the most game-changing development that propelled human progress was the Industrial Revolution. It commenced in the late 18th century, marked by James Watt's steam engine invention. This revolutionized production, transportation, and communication, leading to the first machine age primarily driven by technological innovation.

Today, we find ourselves amidst the second machine age, characterized by the exponential advancement of digital technologies like computers, software, and communication networks. Digitization has brought numerous benefits, such as an increased variety and volume of consumption, as well as an abundance of digital goods and information. However, this era also poses challenges, notably economic disruptions that may leave certain individuals behind due to the rapid pace of digital advancement.

In response to these challenges and opportunities, the book discusses strategies for managing the effects of the second machine age and maximizing its potential benefits. It encourages proactive approaches to ensure that technological progress leads to shared prosperity and societal well-being.

## The Skills Of The New Machines: Technology Races Ahead

In the summer of 2012, the author had the opportunity to ride in a Google autonomous vehicle during a research visit to Silicon Valley. The experience left a strong impression as the car operated flawlessly, its software even aware of blind spots in human-driven vehicles. Initially skeptical about the possibility of computers driving cars, the author's perspective shifted drastically after witnessing the progress in autonomous vehicles.

The division of labor between humans and computers revolves around tasks that can be translated into rules or algorithms for computers, versus tasks that require human pattern recognition. Computers excel at tasks like arithmetic and specific decision-making processes but struggle with tasks involving pattern recognition. Recent advancements in natural language processing, exemplified by Apple's Siri, have significantly improved complex communication between humans and computers. Similarly, translation services like Google Translate can now provide instantaneous translations between numerous languages.

The rapid progress of computers is evident in their acquisition of unexpected skills. IBM's supercomputer, Watson, famously competed and won against human contestants in the TV game show Jeopardy! by combining pattern matching and complex communication. This is just one example of the broad pattern of digital progress seen across various fields, including artificial intelligence, robotics, and self-driving cars.

While robotics has seen gradual progress over the years, recent advancements have been particularly rapid. However, robots still struggle with tasks that humans find simple in the physical world. Moravec's Paradox explains this phenomenon, stating that high-level reasoning requires little computation, while low-level sensorimotor skills demand significant computational resources.

Efforts are underway to address these challenges. Companies like Rethink Robotics aim to build robots capable of handling imprecise tasks and learning from shop floor workers. Others, like Kiva and Boston Dynamics, have made significant strides in tackling Moravec's Paradox, particularly in warehouse logistics and military support.

The DARPA Robotics Challenge has set ambitious goals to develop high-functioning humanoid robots by the end of 2014. The current technological advancements mark an inflection point in history, where what was once science fiction is becoming reality. Examples include smartphones with tricorder-like capabilities, computer-generated prose, and 3D printing of complex objects.

The progress in digital technologies follows an exponential, digital, and combinatorial trajectory, signaling the emergence of the second machine age. The future holds great promise as these advancements continue to reshape and revolutionize various aspects of our lives.

## Mooreâ€™s Law And The Second Half Of The Chessboard

Gordon Moore's most famous contribution is Moore's Law, first proposed in a 1965 article. This law states that the complexity for minimum component costs in integrated circuits roughly doubles every year or two. The computer industry has experienced sustained exponential progress, largely due to the digital world's looser constraints compared to other domains like physics. Moore's Law's impact extends beyond integrated circuits; it has held true for digital progress in various areas.

The concept of exponential growth leads to incredibly large numbers in the second half of the chessboard, making it challenging for most people to fully grasp. Digital sensors, such as microphones, cameras, and accelerometers, have transitioned from the analog to the digital realm, benefiting from Moore's Law's exponential improvement trajectories.

A notable example is the Kinect sensing device from Microsoft's Xbox gaming platform, which achieved impressive real-time three-dimensional mapping and SLAM (simultaneous localization and mapping) problem-solving using digital sensors and proprietary software. We perceive progress with digital technologies as faster these days because we find ourselves in the second half of the chessboard, where exponential growth becomes more pronounced.

The Kinect's capabilities spurred interest in using it for SLAM, leading to projects like Kintinuous after Microsoft made a Kinect software development kit (SDK) available to programmers. All of this has been made possible by cheap and powerful digital sensors, made feasible by Moore's Law.

This steady and exponential improvement has propelled us into the second half of the chessboard, where supercomputer power becomes accessible to consumer products, inexpensive sensors solve previously intractable problems, and science fiction transforms into reality. Moore's Law has driven astonishing technological advancements, and the second half of the chessboard represents a period of unprecedented progress and innovation. The future holds even more promise as the digital age continues to unfold.

## The Digitization Of Just About Everything

In the digital age, learning about new things often involves asking questions and receiving recommendations. This is especially prevalent with the abundance of smartphone applications available on iOS and Android platforms, numbering in the thousands. One such app is Waze, which utilizes GPS technology to offer real-time driving directions and harnesses a network of smartphones as sensors to enhance traffic information.

At the core of the second machine age lies digitization, the process of converting information into digital bits. This transformation has led to the proliferation of big data, a vast resource enabling better comprehension, prediction, and innovation. In this digital landscape, user-generated content and machine-to-machine communication play pivotal roles in sharing knowledge and fostering innovation.

Waze stands as a prime example of innovation built upon multiple layers of digitized data, encompassing maps, GPS data, social interactions, and sensor information. The combination of digitization's power, exponential improvement in technology, and the drive for innovation collectively define and shape the second machine age. It is an era marked by transformative advancements that hold great promise for the future.

## Innovation: Declining Or Recombining?

Innovation stands as a critical driver of economic growth and prosperity. However, an ongoing debate revolves around whether innovation is slowing down or if it is merely taking new, less conspicuous forms. Economists like Bob Gordon and Tyler Cowen are of the opinion that major innovations are becoming scarce, and the progress we observe is mainly derived from secondary improvements.

Contrarily, thinkers like Paul Romer and the authors of the discussed topic argue that innovation is a process centered on recombining existing ideas. From this perspective, the number of potential combinations is practically boundless. In the digital age, technologies like the Internet and open-source platforms play pivotal roles in facilitating recombinant innovation. These digital tools empower more people to participate and experiment with fresh combinations of ideas.

Notable examples of recombinant innovation include the likes of Waze, Facebook, and Instagram, which ingeniously combine existing technologies to deliver new and valuable experiences. Open innovation and crowdsourcing platforms like Innocentive and Kaggle further exemplify the power of diverse collaboration in solving complex problems and generating substantial improvements over existing solutions.

For instance, Kaggle's competitions on computer grading of student essays, sponsored by the Hewlett Foundation, showcased how data scientists without prior experience outperformed established educational testing companies. Companies such as Quirky and Affinnova embrace recombinant innovation by tapping into the collective wisdom of crowds and utilizing algorithms to identify valuable idea combinations.

It's essential to note that digital advancements in innovation extend well beyond high-tech sectors and positively impact various facets of life. From driving to solar flare predictions, food science, toxicology, and product design, the transformative influence of digital innovation is pervasive.

The authors maintain a sense of optimism regarding the future of innovation and productivity. The abundance of building blocks combined with the continuous recombination of ideas promises a bright outlook for the world of innovation, paving the way for progress and advancement in diverse fields.

The synergy between human ingenuity and technological advancement is expected to yield impressive insights, products, and solutions in the years to come, heralding an era of unprecedented growth and innovation.

## Computing Bounty

Over the past century, living standards have seen a remarkable increase both in the United States and worldwide. In the US, GDP growth per person has maintained an average of 1.9 percent annually since the early 1800s, effectively doubling living standards every thirty-six years. This continuous economic growth has the potential to address various challenges, and even small increments in GDP growth can yield significant impacts on the economy and budget.

The primary driver of this increased GDP per person is productivity growth, which arises from innovative advancements in technology and production techniques. General Purpose Technologies (GPTs), such as electricity and computers, have played a pivotal role in driving sustained productivity improvements over time. However, fully harnessing the productivity benefits of GPTs requires complementary innovations, including organizational changes and business process redesign.

The introduction of computers in the 1990s brought about a notable surge in productivity, mirroring the effects observed during the advent of electricity in the late 1800s. Although there is a current slowdown in productivity growth, experts believe it to be temporary and partly influenced by the aftermath of the Great Recession.

Looking ahead, the second machine age technologies, such as digitization and networks, continue to rapidly improve, presenting opportunities for significant combinatorial innovation and future productivity growth. Embracing these technological advancements and fostering an environment conducive to innovation can drive further progress and prosperity in the years to come.


## Beyond GDP

During the Great Depression, President Hoover faced challenges in understanding the economy as he had to rely on scattered data. It was only in 1937 that Simon Kuznets developed national accounts, which provided metrics to track economic activity, offering a more comprehensive view.

With the advent of the second machine age, the economy shifted its focus from tangible things to intangible ideas and interactions. However, this transition made it challenging to accurately measure the sources of value. For instance, while music sales declined in physical media, they grew through digital downloads and streaming, altering the pricing dynamics while maintaining the same inherent value of music.

GDP, the traditional economic measure, fails to fully quantify overall welfare, especially in the second machine age. It may mislead, as it does not account for the consumer surplus and the value of free goods that significantly contribute to welfare. Additionally, the introduction of new goods and services and the reduction of prices due to digitization also add to welfare but remain unreflected in GDP.

The rise of digitization has brought increased transparency and efficiency in various industries, benefiting consumers. However, this changing economic landscape has elevated the importance of intangible assets like intellectual property, organizational capital, user-generated content, and human capital. Investments in human capital are becoming critical as automation takes over routine tasks, necessitating human creativity.

Unfortunately, official GDP calculations largely ignore these crucial intangible assets. However, there have been efforts to create experimental "satellite accounts" to track some of these intangible assets in the U.S. economy, acknowledging their significance.

To truly grasp the changes brought by the second machine age, new metrics are needed that can capture the value of intangible assets and the evolving nature of the economy. The abundance of digital data presents an opportunity to revolutionize our understanding of the economy, going beyond conventional measures like GDP and productivity growth.

As we move forward, it is essential to recognize that while GDP and productivity growth are important indicators, they are means to an end. We must consider other values and goals to bridge the gap between what we measure and what we truly value, especially in a rapidly changing digital world where new goods emerge, and existing goods become free through digitization.

## The Spread

The transition from analog to digital photography has revolutionized the photography industry, leading to a significant increase in the number of photos taken and transforming the economics of production and distribution. Unlike pre-digital companies like Kodak, modern digital platforms such as Instagram and Facebook employ fewer people but create substantial wealth for a select few individuals, contributing to income inequality.

The rise of digital technologies, characterized by skill-biased technical change, has favored individuals with higher levels of human capital, widening the income gap. The winners in today's economy are those who possess significant capital assets or possess unique talents and skills.

While exponential technological progress and digital technologies have generated unprecedented wealth, they have also contributed to a more dispersed income distribution. Skill-biased technical change and organizational innovation have resulted in job polarization, with a decline in demand for routine tasks but stability in nonroutine cognitive and manual jobs.

Digital technologies have disrupted traditional models of technology's impact, with benefits often disproportionately favoring a few winners, leaving others struggling to keep up. Demand for routine cognitive and manual tasks has plummeted due to the advances in information technology, rendering many jobs obsolete.

As technology evolves, machines can perform an increasing array of tasks, though mimicking abstract reasoning remains a challenge. However, significant progress has been made in specific domains, like chess-playing programs.

The advent of technology has also altered the distribution of national income between capital and labor, with capital sometimes substituting labor due to economic incentives. Historically, labor's share of GDP remained stable, but recent information age technologies have contributed to its decline, resulting in soaring profits.

The income of CEOs might not solely arise from labor income but also from their control of capital. The value of existing capital can be affected as new capital is cheaply added at the margin, potentially impacting capitalists' returns.

In the second machine age, the scarcity and value of resources will play a crucial role in determining winners and losers, separating superstars from the rest of the population. The changing landscape presents both opportunities and challenges as the digital era reshapes our economy and society.


## The Biggest Winners: Stars And Superstars

Skill-biased technical change has had a significant impact on the labor market, increasing demand for highly educated workers while reducing demand for less educated workers with routine tasks. Similarly, capital-biased technological changes have favored capital owners, leading to increased profits and a decrease in the share of income going to labor.

Moreover, talent-biased technical change has exacerbated income inequality, creating a widening gap between superstars and the rest of the population across various industries. The top 1 percent and top 0.01 percent of income earners have seen substantial increases in their share of income, with the top 0.01 percent experiencing their share doubling between 1995 and 2007.

The rise of superstars, such as authors, musicians, and athletes, has been fueled by digitization and globalization. Winner-take-all markets have become more prevalent due to advancements in technology, communication, transportation, and the importance of networks and standards. In these markets, small differences in skill or luck can lead to significant disparities in earnings.

The growth of niche products and services in the long tail has provided opportunities for differentiation, but it has not reduced overall income inequality. The superstar economy's income distribution is characterized by power law distributions, with a few individuals reaping a disproportionately large share of sales.

Various factors, including the concentration of wealth, changes in laws and institutions, and cultural shifts, have contributed to the rise of superstar compensation. Power laws describe income and sales distributions in different markets, with a small number of top earners or products accounting for a significant portion of the total.

The U.S. economy exhibits a mix of log-normal and power-law distributions, with the power law fitting incomes at the top. This shift to a power-law distribution has significant implications, challenging traditional mental models based on averages and modes. It can lead to increased income inequality and a scenario where most people fall below the income average.

Some refer to this shift in income distribution as "luck-biased technical change," reflecting the importance of chance in determining superstar outcomes. In 2011, families with incomes above $367,000 were part of the top 1 percent in the United States, but the average income for this group is significantly higher.

Power-law distributions are characteristic of superstar markets, where a small number of individuals directly benefit from digitization and other technologies that foster superstardom. The impact of these technological advancements on income distribution is profound and requires careful consideration for future economic policies.

## Implications Of The Bounty And The Spread

GDP and innovation are reaching unprecedented heights, yet a sense of pessimism about future living standards is growing among people. While the income of the median household in America has declined, the net worth of billionaires on Forbes' list has quintupled. This decoupling of productivity and employment since the late 1990s is troubling, with productivity rising while employment lags behind. Even in places like Silicon Valley, where rapid innovation is evident, many individuals face financial hardships and mounting debt.

Three crucial questions about the future arise: Will the abundance created by technology be evenly spread among the population? Can technology result in structural unemployment? And what impact will globalization have on wages and employment?

Undoubtedly, technology is contributing to a more abundant world with higher productivity, leading to benefits like improved quality and increased choice. However, rising income inequality and uneven distribution of the bounty raise concerns. While overall progress is being made, economic inequality could result in political inequality and the formation of extractive institutions, ultimately hampering further advancement.

The contention regarding technology's impact on employment centers on the argument that it creates more jobs than it destroys, based on economic theory and historical evidence. Nevertheless, some mechanisms, such as inelastic demand, rapid change, and severe inequality, could lead to technological unemployment. Specific sectors may experience falling employment despite productivity gains due to inelastic demand, while others with elastic demand could see increased employment alongside greater productivity.

The historical evidence on technology's effect on employment is inconclusive, leading to an ongoing debate among economists. The concept of technological unemployment remains contentious, and its potential impact varies depending on the elasticity of demand. If demand elasticity is precisely equal to one, productivity increases will be matched by an equal rise in demand, and total revenues will remain constant. However, Keynes disagreed with the idea of perfect elasticity in the long run, predicting that increased productivity would lead to reduced working hours and more leisure time.

An inability to keep pace with technological change in terms of skills, organizations, and institutions can lead to temporary unemployment. Technological advancements create winners and losers, as certain skills and jobs become less in demand. Globalization also affects wages and employment, but automation and technology advancements play a significant role in job displacement. While globalization has led to dislocations, automation and robotics can improve the efficiency of both American and Chinese workers, resulting in increased output with fewer employees in both countries.

The impact of automation is likely to be most profound on low-cost workers in developing nations that rely on low wages for their competitive advantage. As automation becomes more prevalent, it may lead to the return of manufacturing to developed nations, as the cost advantage of low wages diminishes over time. Routine, well-structured tasks that were once offshored are often the easiest to automate in the long run. Attempts to fend off technological advances by cutting wages are merely temporary solutions and are not sustainable in the long term.

## Learning To Race With Machines: Recommendations For Individuals

Concerns about career opportunities in the second machine age have become widespread among parents, students, educators, and policymakers. While technology has made significant advancements, humans still have essential roles to play, even in areas where digital machines have surpassed them. The game of chess serves as an example, demonstrating how humans, when teamed up with machines, can outperform both strong computers and strong human players alone.

Humans possess unique abilities like ideation, creativity, and innovation, which technology has not yet been able to fully replicate. Their sensory capabilities, such as vision, hearing, and touch, provide them with a broader frame for pattern recognition compared to digital technologies. To foster these crucial skills, self-organizing learning environments (SOLEs) have been proposed, helping students develop ideation, large-frame pattern recognition, and complex communication.

However, a study reveals that many college students today are not experiencing significant improvement in critical thinking and communication skills during their education. To address this, online educational resources like Khan Academy and Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs) offer opportunities for self-paced learning and skill improvement.

The college premium, the advantage in wages earned by college graduates, is growing, emphasizing the importance of higher education and acquiring valuable skills in the current job market. Successful entrepreneurs like Bill Gates and Jeff Bezos recognized the potential of technology and low-cost online commerce to shape their ventures.

Graduates with cognitive skills, whether in STEM or non-STEM fields, can command premium wages due to their complementarity with low-cost data and computing power. However, there is a troubling trend of "degree inflation," where more employers require college degrees even for entry-level jobs. In the future, MOOCs and other educational innovations may provide a lower-cost alternative to traditional colleges.

Despite technological advancements, many future careers will still involve interacting with the physical world, an area where computers are comparatively weak. Jobs like cooks, repairmen, and home health aides involve sensorimotor work and complex communication, making them less susceptible to automation. Nevertheless, digital progress has the potential to surprise us, and tasks considered resistant to automation today might become automated in the future.

In this rapidly changing landscape, being adaptable and flexible in career aspirations is crucial as automation continues to shape the job market. Developing a diverse skill set and remaining open to learning will be essential for thriving in the second machine age.

## Policy Recommendations

Encouraging the benefits of the second machine age while mitigating its harmful effects requires a strong focus on economic growth and prosperity. Although digital labor and technology have made significant strides, they are not complete substitutes for human labor. Many jobs still demand unique human skills and interaction, making economic growth vital to creating more job opportunities.

Investing in primary education is a key step to bridge the gap between technology and education. By promoting quality education, we can foster economic growth and reduce inequality. Leveraging digital technologies in education, such as Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs), can enhance access to quality learning and continuously improve teaching methods.

Promoting entrepreneurship is equally essential as it creates new jobs and industries to replace those that may be automated away. This requires reducing unnecessary regulations and creating a favorable business environment that supports innovation and risk-taking.

To improve job market efficiency, facilitating matches between job seekers and employers through technology and better data can be highly effective. By streamlining the hiring process, we can match talent with opportunities more efficiently.

Continued government support for basic academic research is crucial for fostering innovation and driving the creation of new technologies. It is essential to reverse the trend of reduced federal funding for basic research in America.

Reforming the U.S. intellectual property regime, particularly software patents and copyright duration, can encourage innovation while ensuring fair access to ideas and knowledge.

To stimulate innovation and tackle ambitious goals, the use of prizes can be a powerful tool. Incentivizing breakthroughs through competitions can drive progress in critical areas.

Upgrading infrastructure is essential to improving productivity and enhancing the overall quality of life. Modern infrastructure supports economic growth and makes a nation more competitive on the global stage.

Implementing immigration reform is also necessary to attract and retain talent. A welcoming and inclusive immigration policy can drive innovation and contribute to economic growth.

Using Pigovian taxes to discourage unwanted activities and generate revenue is an effective way to address negative externalities. These taxes can incentivize environmentally friendly practices and fund initiatives that benefit society.

Lastly, increasing taxes on economic rents and high-income earners can provide funding for public services and contribute to reducing income inequality. A fair and progressive tax system can ensure a more equitable distribution of resources and opportunities.

## Long-term Recommendations

The second machine age, with its exponential, digital, and combinatorial innovation, has raised concerns about the impact on human job prospects. Rather than halting technological progress, the focus should be on finding ways to address the challenges it poses. While some are skeptical about fundamental alternatives to capitalism, efforts to deal with the rise of androids and digital labor are necessary to prevent unemployment and weak demand, which could slow economic growth.

One proposed solution to address unemployment is the concept of a basic income, providing everyone with a minimum standard of living. However, critics argue that it may not fully address the need for work and its associated benefits, such as self-worth, engagement, and purpose, which are crucial for a healthy society. An alternative approach, like Milton Friedman's negative income tax proposal, can incentivize work while still ensuring a guaranteed minimum income.

On the other hand, payroll taxes and employer mandates may discourage work and lead to an accelerated adoption of machines over human labor. To harness the potential of human skills alongside technology, the peer economy, where humans and machines collaborate, can be a valuable approach. Algorithms and automation benefit from human judgment and understanding in many areas, leading to new ways of organizing work and accomplishing tasks.

Crowdsourcing and the peer economy are emerging trends that leverage technology to tap into human labor and assets. Platforms like TaskRabbit, Airbnb, and Lyft provide economic opportunities and work for people, although they are still relatively small compared to overall unemployment.

Policy makers should focus on encouraging innovations that increase the value of human labor rather than replacing it. Ideas to address the challenges of technological progress include creating a national mutual fund for widespread ownership of capital, directing technical change towards human augmentation instead of substitution, paying people for socially beneficial tasks, nurturing special categories of work done only by humans, and exploring policy experimentation.

By taking proactive steps to shape technological progress, society can embrace the benefits of the second machine age while addressing its potential disruptions.

## Technology And The Future

The dream of having automated servants fulfilling our material needs is an ancient fantasy. In the second machine age, powered by silicon, metal, and plastic, we are witnessing unprecedented technological advancements. However, along with these advancements come challenges and risks due to the increasing complexity and interconnectedness of digital systems. The future could be vulnerable to accidents, cyber-attacks, and the potential misuse of advanced technologies.

As we contemplate the possibility of true machine intelligence and digital consciousness, questions arise about the relationship between humans and machines. It is crucial to recognize that the future is not solely determined by technology; our choices and values will play a significant role in shaping it. Therefore, as we step into the second machine age, we must carefully consider the societal impact of technological progress and strive for shared prosperity and meaningful human activities.
