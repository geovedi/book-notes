# Severed: A History of Heads Lost and Found
**Author**: Frances Larson | **Year**: 2014

## Summary
"Severed" explores humanity's enduring fascination with detached human heads, from shrunken heads to skull collections to execution trophies. Larson reveals how our obsession with heads reflects deeper cultural anxieties about identity, power, mortality, and the boundaries between civilization and savagery. The book challenges us to reconsider who the real "headhunters" are—the tribal peoples who created these objects or the Western collectors who acquired them.

This compelling historical investigation will appeal to readers interested in anthropology, medical history, colonialism, and the darker corners of human nature. Anyone curious about why we're simultaneously repelled by and drawn to human remains will find unsettling insights about our own cultural assumptions.

## Core Insights

### The Shrunken Head Paradox
Larson uses the famous shrunken heads (tsantsas) at Oxford's Pitt Rivers Museum to reveal a startling truth: most "authentic" tribal headhunting was actually driven by Western demand. European and American collectors created the market that transformed sacred spiritual objects into commercial commodities. Of the ten shrunken heads displayed at Oxford, only three are authentic—the rest are fake heads made from monkeys, sloths, or unclaimed hospital corpses supplied to satisfy Western curiosity.

> "Visitors may see these exhibits and think of them as the gruesome trophies of an untouched savage people, when what they are actually seeing are the gruesome trophies of a western fascination with the idea of an untouched savage people."

**Quick Take**: Our fascination with "primitive" headhunters says more about Western colonial fantasies than about indigenous cultures.

### Science as Justification for Headhunting
The 19th century saw anthropologists and scientists actively collecting human remains under the guise of scientific progress. Professional handbooks explicitly encouraged researchers to acquire skulls, hands, feet, and even entire heads for study. This "scientific headhunting" often involved grave-robbing, buying bodies from prisons, or exploiting recent deaths. Museums became filled with thousands of human remains, reduced to measurements and racial categories.

> "Science, it seemed, excused a multitude of sins, particularly when the 'subjects of study' were impoverished, imprisoned or deemed to be primitive."

**Quick Take**: Scientific authority has historically been used to justify practices that would otherwise be considered criminal or unethical.

### The Commodification of Human Remains
From Maori tattooed heads to Oliver Cromwell's preserved head, Larson demonstrates how human heads became valuable objects in global trade. The Maori, who traditionally preserved heads of enemy chiefs, began forcibly tattooing slaves specifically for the European market. When Governor Darling banned the trade in 1831, it was because it "tends greatly to increase the sacrifice of human life amongst savages"—ignoring European demand's role in creating the market.

**Quick Take**: When human remains become commodities, the line between cultural practice and commercial exploitation quickly blurs.

### The Execution Spectacle
The book traces how public executions turned severed heads into entertainment and state propaganda. From medieval gate displays to the French guillotine, heads served as powerful symbols of state power. Crowds would gather to watch beheadings, judging executioners' performance and sometimes stealing heads for rescue or desecration. The guillotine was meant to make executions more humane, but crowds complained it was too quick and uninteresting to watch.

> "What was the point of coming out to watch something you could not see?"

**Quick Take**: Our relationship with public violence reveals more about our society's values than about the criminals being punished.

### The Ethics of Display
Modern museums face difficult questions about displaying human remains. Larson argues these exhibits can either reinforce colonial stereotypes or foster meaningful cross-cultural understanding. Rather than removing controversial objects, she suggests museums have a duty to tell complete stories that contextualize violence as "meaningful—if brutal—strategies, adopted by people in times of social crisis."

**Quick Take**: How we display the dead reflects our own cultural values more than those of the people who created these objects.

## Best Quotes
- "Objects that defy the practicalities of their own creation acquire a little magic, and it was the nature of the transformation from person to thing that enchanted us."
- "This is one of the most fascinating artefacts in the museum. People come from all over the world to see the shrunken heads."
- "It is hard to deny the hypocrisy of nineteenth-century collectors who condemned headhunting as barbaric while seeking out human heads to display at home."
- "Rather than positioning ourselves behind the rope barriers and maintaining those old colonial boundaries, we can explore the spaces that the tsantsas open up."
- "If the Shuar do not mind seeing these shrunken heads in a museum display, then maybe we should not mind either; it is not so much the fact that tsantsas are on display that is problematic, it is the kinds of messages they are sending out to people who come and see them."

## Action Items
- **Visit museums critically**: Question the narratives behind human remains displays and consider whose perspectives are missing
- **Examine your own fascination**: Reflect on why we're drawn to gruesome artifacts and what this reveals about our cultural assumptions
- **Research collection histories**: Look into how museums acquired controversial objects and what this tells us about colonial relationships
- **Support ethical curation**: Advocate for museums that provide complete contextual information rather than sensational displays
- **Question scientific authority**: Consider how scientific research has been used to justify ethically questionable practices throughout history

## Questions to Consider
- Why are we simultaneously repelled by and fascinated with human remains?
- How does displaying the dead in museums affect how we understand other cultures?
- What responsibility do modern institutions have for objects acquired through ethically questionable means?
- How does our fascination with "primitive" headhunting reflect Western cultural anxieties?
- Can scientific collecting ever be separated from colonial power dynamics?

## Conclusion
"Severed" is a masterful investigation that uses the unsettling subject of detached heads to explore profound questions about human nature, colonialism, and the ethics of collecting. Larson demonstrates that our obsession with heads—whether shrunken, tattooed, or executed—reveals more about Western culture than about the "primitive" peoples we often project these fears onto.

The book's greatest strength is its ability to make readers question their own assumptions about civilization and savagery. By exposing how Western demand often created the very headhunting practices it claimed to condemn, Larson forces us to confront uncomfortable truths about scientific authority, colonial exploitation, and our enduring fascination with the boundary between life and death.

This is definitely worth your time if you're interested in history, anthropology, or the darker aspects of human behavior. The biggest reason to read it is Larson's skill at turning a seemingly morbid subject into a profound meditation on what it means to be human—and how we treat the dead reveals our deepest cultural values.
