# Working Stiff: Two Years, 262 Bodies, and the Making of a Medical Examiner
**Authors**: Judy Melinek MD, T.J. Mitchell | **Year**: 2014

## Summary
"Working Stiff" is a gripping memoir that takes readers behind the scenes of New York City's Office of Chief Medical Examiner, where Dr. Judy Melinek documents her transformation from a surgical resident haunted by burnout to a skilled forensic pathologist. Through vivid accounts of 262 bodies over two years, including her pivotal role in the September 11th victim identification efforts, Melinek reveals how confronting death daily paradoxically taught her to live more fully and fearlessly.

This book offers rare insight into forensic pathology's scientific rigor while exploring profound questions about mortality, justice, and human resilience. Readers will discover the emotional truth behind crime shows, understand why death investigation matters for the living, and gain a new appreciation for the doctors who speak for those who can no longer speak for themselves.

## The Journey to Forensic Pathology

### From Surgery to Autopsy
Melinek began as a surgical resident, working brutal 130-hour weeks that pushed her to physical and emotional collapse. After fainting during surgery and nearly making fatal medication errors, she realized the system was broken—not just for doctors, but for patients. This burnout led her to pathology, where she discovered her calling in forensic death investigation. The transition from healing the living to investigating the dead wasn't about death fascination, but about finding meaning in helping the bereaved understand truth.

> "I had spent the previous four years training as a hospital pathologist in a fluorescent-lit world of sterile labs and blue scrubs. Now I found myself at a windy crime scene in the middle of Manhattan rush hour, gore on the sidewalk, blue lights and yellow tape, a crowd of gawkers, grim cops, and coworkers who kept using the word 'clusterfuck.' I was hooked."

**Quick Take**: Sometimes the wrong career path leads to exactly where you need to be.

### The Making of a Medical Examiner
Training at NYC's Office of Chief Medical Examiner meant learning from legendary Dr. Charles Hirsch, who taught that precision matters in both language and science. Melinek and her fellow fellows learned everything from proper documentation to the cultural significance of the office's Latin motto: "Let conversation cease. Let laughter flee. This is the place where Death delights to help the living." They discovered that forensic pathology demands both scientific detachment and profound empathy.

**Quick Take**: The best professionals balance technical expertise with human compassion.

## Life Lessons from Death

### Facing Fear Through Knowledge
Counterintuitively, working daily with death freed Melinek from everyday anxieties. While she expected to become paranoid about dangers, she instead learned that most deaths result from either mundane risks or predictable hazards. Her conclusion: staying alive is mostly common sense—don't jaywalk, wear seatbelts, avoid drugs, and pay attention to yellow lines on subway platforms.

> "Once I became an eyewitness to death, I found that nearly every unexpected fatality I investigated was either the result of something dangerously mundane, or of something predictably hazardous."

**Quick Take**: Understanding risks is more empowering than avoiding them.

### Working for the Living
Melinek emphasizes that her true patients aren't the dead bodies on her table, but the surviving family members who need answers. The medical examiner's work provides closure, helps families navigate bureaucratic challenges, and contributes to justice. Whether identifying a John Doe through dental records or explaining a suicide to grieving parents, her role is to translate medical facts into human understanding.

**Quick Take**: The most meaningful work often serves those who can't repay you.

## The Science and Art of Death Investigation

### Beyond the Autopsy Table
The book reveals that autopsy is just one part of comprehensive death investigation. Melinek works with forensic anthropologists, toxicologists, and police detectives to piece together circumstances surrounding deaths. Each case becomes a puzzle requiring anatomical knowledge, scientific analysis, and deductive reasoning. From determining time of death to identifying victims through skeletal remains, forensic pathology combines multiple disciplines to find truth.

**Quick Take**: Complex problems rarely have single-discipline solutions.

### September 11th: The Ultimate Test
Melinek's accounts of the World Trade Center victim identification efforts are both haunting and inspiring. She describes working twelve-hour shifts in makeshift morgues, processing thousands of remains, and making dozens of death notification calls. The experience revealed forensic pathology's critical role in national tragedies while showing how professionals maintain humanity amid overwhelming circumstances.

**Quick Take**: True professionalism shines brightest under extreme pressure.
