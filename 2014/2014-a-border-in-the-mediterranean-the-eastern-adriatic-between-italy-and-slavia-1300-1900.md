# A Border in the Mediterranean: The Eastern Adriatic Between Italy and Slavia (1300-1900)
**Original Title**: Un confine nel Mediterraneo. L'Adriatico orientale tra Italia e Slavia (1300-1900)
**Author**: Egidio Ivetic | **Year**: 2014

## Summary
This groundbreaking historical work examines the eastern Adriatic coast as a complex borderland where Italian and Slavic cultures, languages, and civilizations intersected over six centuries. Ivetic challenges traditional nationalist historiographies by presenting the region not as a simple dividing line, but as a dynamic "fault line" where multiple identities coexisted, merged, and sometimes clashed. The book focuses primarily on Istria and Dalmatia as emblematic case studies of Mediterranean borderlands, revealing how political boundaries rarely matched linguistic or cultural realities, and how plurilingualism was the norm rather than the exception.

This book will appeal to historians, students of Mediterranean studies, and anyone interested in understanding how borders work in practice. Readers will gain a sophisticated framework for thinking about cultural hybridity, the limits of nationalist narratives, and the complex legacy of Venetian, Ottoman, and Habsburg rule in shaping modern Balkan identities.

## Core Insights

### The Eastern Adriatic as Historical Subject
The eastern Adriatic coast should be studied as a distinct historical space in its own right, not merely as a backdrop to the histories of Venice, the Ottoman Empire, or modern nation-states. This region represents a unique convergence point between Mediterranean and Central European worlds, where Latin, Italian, and Slavic cultures interwove for centuries. Rather than seeing it as a periphery, Ivetic argues for understanding it as a central player in Mediterranean history with its own agency and historical dynamics.

> "The eastern Adriatic constitutes one of the most complex zones of the Mediterranean. The book proposes a reading of this coastline: border between models of civilization, frontier between States and religions, a historical subject/object in itself still not understood."
> _Original: "L'Adriatico orientale è una delle zone più complesse del Mediterraneo. Il libro propone una lettura di questo litorale: confine tra modelli di civiltà, frontiera tra Stati e religioni, un soggetto/oggetto storico di per sé ancora non compreso."_
**Quick Take**: Borders are often more interesting than the centers they separate—they're where the real historical innovation happens.

### The Fault Line Between Italy and Slavia
Rather than a simple boundary, the Italy-Slavia border was a "fault line" where linguistic, cultural, and religious identities overlapped and intermingled. For centuries, Italian (and earlier, Latin) and Slavic languages coexisted in complex patterns that didn't follow political borders. The author challenges the idea of clear linguistic divisions, showing instead how plurilingualism characterized urban and rural life alike, with people shifting identities based on context rather than fixed categories.

> "The linguistic border was a certainly perceived border; but, from our perspective, it is a construct elaborated a posteriori, by historians, linguists, historians of language."
> _Original: "Il confine linguistico era un confine certo percepito; ma, dalla nostra prospettiva, esso è un costrutto elaborato a posteriori, da storici, linguisti, storici della lingua."_
**Quick Take**: Language boundaries are rarely as clear as nationalists would like us to believe.

### Venice's Dominance Without Colonization
The Venetian territories in Istria and Dalmatia weren't "colonies" in the traditional sense, but rather extreme peripheries of Venice itself. This crucial distinction helps explain why Italian culture persisted without requiring demographic dominance. Venetian rule created a framework where urban Italian culture could flourish alongside rural Slavic communities, creating a unique symbiosis rather than simple cultural imposition.

> "The situations of historical Istria and Dalmatia, particularly of Venetian Istria and Venetian Dalmatia, are improperly indicated by much historiography as 'Venetian colonies,' when they should be understood as extreme peripheries of Venice itself."
> _Original: "Le situazioni storiche dell'Istria e della Dalmazia, in particolare dell'Istria veneta e della Dalmazia veneta, sono indicate in modo improprio da tanta storiografia come 'colonie veneziane', mentre dovrebbero essere intese come estreme periferie di Venezia stessa."_
**Quick Take**: Cultural influence works best when it doesn't try to replace local cultures but adapts to them.

### The Coastal-Inland Dichotomy
The fundamental cultural divide in the eastern Adriatic wasn't between Italians and Slavs, but between coastal (Mediterranean) and inland (continental) ways of life. The coast, whether under Venetian or later Austrian rule, maintained Mediterranean cultural patterns, Catholic religious uniformity, and urban pluralism. The Ottoman-controlled interior developed different patterns of religious diversity (Catholic, Orthodox, Muslim) within linguistic unity.

> "With respect to plurilingualism and, at the same time, the confessional and cultural homogeneity of the coast, the Ottoman hinterland was characterized by linguistic uniformity in Croatian and Serbian speech, idioms shared by populations who instead differentiated themselves as Catholics, Orthodox and Muslims."
> _Original: "Rispetto al plurilinguismo e, allo stesso tempo, all'omogeneità confessionale e culturale della costa, l'entroterra ottomano era connotato dall'uniformità linguistica, nelle parlate croate e serbe, idiomi condivisi da popolazioni che si sono invece differenziate in quanto cattolici, ortodossi e musulmani."_
**Quick Take**: Geography often shapes culture more than politics or ethnicity.

### The 19th-Century Nationalist Transformation
The modern period (post-1848) witnessed a radical shift from fluid, plural identities to rigid national categories. Previously, communities had identified themselves through territory, religion, or urban-rural distinctions. The rise of nationalism forced people into binary choices between Italian and Slavic identities, creating political majorities and minorities where previously complex overlapping identities had prevailed.

> "The processes of collective identification transformed in national terms. The new imaginaries, the national geographies did not coincide and could not coincide, as we know, with political geographies."
> _Original: "I processi di identificazione collettiva si trasformarono in chiave nazionale. I nuovi immaginari, le geografie nazionali non coincisero e non potevano coincidere, si sa, con le geografie politiche."_
**Quick Take**: Nationalism often destroys the very cultural complexity it claims to celebrate.

## Best Quotes

- "The eastern Adriatic should be seen and studied as a historical space in itself, as a historical and historiographical problem within the Mediterranean and Europe."
  _Original: "L'Adriatico orientale andrebbe quindi visto e studiato come uno spazio storico a sé, come un problema storico e storiografico nell'ambito del Mediterraneo e d'Europa."_

- "What strikes me, and what is the object of reflection in this essay, is precisely the continuity, the long duration, or, if you will, the repetitiveness of certain situations."
  _Original: "Ciò che colpisce, e che è oggetto di riflessione in questo saggio, è proprio la continuità, la lunga durata, o, volendo, la ripetitività di certe situazioni."_

- "Border and confrontation with the other served as a coagulant in the definition or self-definition of one or more communities in the eastern Adriatic lands."
  _Original: "Di certo, la frontiera e il confronto con l'altro hanno fatto da coagulante nella definizione o auto-definizione di una o più comunità nelle terre adriatiche orientali."_

- "In the coastal areas, the diversity of language and belonging to so-called ethnic groups did not coincide with diversity of culture and civilization."
  _Original: "Nel litorale, la diversità di lingua e di appartenenza ai cosiddetti gruppi etnici non ha coinciso con la diversità di cultura e civiltà."_

## Key Takeaways

- **Borders Create Culture**: The eastern Adriatic's unique culture emerged precisely from its position as a borderland, not despite it
- **Plurilingualism Was Normal**: For centuries, most inhabitants spoke multiple languages and shifted identities based on context
- **Religion Unified More Than Language Divided**: Catholicism provided cultural cohesion across linguistic divides on the coast
- **Nationalism Simplified Complexity**: Modern nation-states imposed artificial clarity on naturally messy cultural realities
- **Venice's Legacy Endured**: Venetian cultural patterns persisted long after political control ended

## Questions to Consider

- How does viewing the eastern Adriatic as a distinct historical space change our understanding of Mediterranean and European history?
- In what ways did plurilingualism function as both a practical necessity and a cultural advantage?
- Why did nationalist ideologies succeed in replacing earlier, more fluid forms of identity?
- How does the Adriatic experience compare to other Mediterranean borderlands?
- What lessons does this history offer for understanding contemporary conflicts in the Balkans?

## Conclusion
This is a dense, academic work that rewards patient reading with profound insights into how borders, cultures, and identities actually function in practice. Ivetic's transnational approach cuts through centuries of nationalist historiography to reveal a more complex and fascinating reality. The book's greatest strength is its ability to show how the eastern Adriatic wasn't just a meeting point between Italy and Slavia, but a unique cultural space that created its own distinct patterns of coexistence and conflict.

While the specialized nature and academic prose may challenge general readers, those interested in Mediterranean history, Balkan studies, or border theory will find this an indispensable work. The book fundamentally changes how we understand not just this specific region, but the very nature of cultural frontiers and the human capacity for creating hybrid identities in contested spaces. Essential reading for anyone who wants to move beyond simplistic nationalist narratives to grasp the messy, complicated reality of how real people have lived at the crossroads of civilizations.
