# Don't Make Me Think, Revisited
**Author**: Steve Krug | **Year**: 2014 | **Category**: Technology & Computing

## Summary
"Don't Make Me Think, Revisited" is a practical guide to web usability that argues for designing intuitive, self-evident digital experiences. Krug's central thesis is that users should never have to expend mental energy figuring out how to use a website or application—they should understand it at a glance. The book presents timeless principles of user-centered design that apply equally to websites and mobile apps, emphasizing that usability is about people and how they understand things, not about technology.

This book is essential reading for web designers, developers, product managers, and anyone involved in creating digital experiences. It provides practical insights that will help you build more intuitive products, reduce user frustration, and create interfaces that feel effortless to use.

## Core Insights

### Krug's First Law of Usability: Don't Make Me Think
The foundational principle states that as far as humanly possible, when users look at a web page, it should be self-evident, obvious, and self-explanatory. Users should be able to "get it"—what it is and how to use it—without expending any effort thinking about it. This means designing pages where thought bubbles say "OK, there's the ___. And that's a ___. And there's the thing that I want" rather than being filled with question marks.

> "It's the overriding principle—the ultimate tie breaker when deciding whether a design works or it doesn't. If you have room in your head for only one usability rule, make this the one."

**Quick Take**: Design for immediate comprehension—test whether someone can understand your interface in 5 seconds without explanation.

### How Users Really Use the Web: Scanning, Satisficing, and Muddling Through
Users don't read websites carefully—they scan them rapidly, looking for keywords and phrases that match their goals. They don't make optimal choices; they satisfice by choosing the first reasonable option that seems promising. And they don't figure out how things work; they muddle through without understanding the underlying logic.

> "We're usually on a mission. Most Web use involves trying to get something done, and usually done quickly. As a result, Web users tend to act like sharks: They have to keep moving, or they'll die."

**Quick Take**: Design for scanners, not readers—use clear headings, bullets, and highlighted keywords to guide users to what they need quickly.

### Design for Scanning: The Billboard Approach
Treat your web pages like billboards that people drive by at high speed. Use visual hierarchies, conventions, and formatting that support scanning rather than reading. This includes creating clear visual hierarchies where the most important elements stand out, following established web conventions (logo in top-left, navigation across top or down left side), and formatting content with plenty of white space, short paragraphs, and bulleted lists.

> "The net effect is a lot like Gary Larson's classic Far Side cartoon about the difference between what we say to dogs and what they hear. What we see when we look at a page depends on what we have in mind, and it's usually just a fraction of what's there."

**Quick Take**: Use visual hierarchy and conventions to make your pages instantly understandable at a glance.

### Navigation: Street Signs and Breadcrumbs
Good navigation is crucial because users always need to know where they are, where they've been, and where they can go. Use clear, persistent navigation that follows conventions, include obvious page names that match what users clicked to get there, and provide visual cues about location. Navigation should be self-evident and help users build a mental map of your site structure.

> "Where things will be located on a page. For example, users expect the logo identifying the site to be in the top-left corner and the primary navigation to be across the top or down the left side."

**Quick Take**: Make navigation obvious and consistent—users should never wonder where they are or how to get somewhere else.

### Usability Testing: The Great Equalizer
Test early, test often, and test with real users. Krug advocates for simple, low-cost usability testing that anyone can do—recruit 3-5 users, give them realistic tasks, and watch where they get stuck. Testing reveals problems you'd never anticipate and settles design arguments by showing what actually works rather than what people prefer.

> "Where debates about what people like waste time and drain the team's energy, usability testing tends to defuse most arguments and break impasses by moving the discussion away from the realm of what's right or wrong and what people like or dislike and into the realm of what works or doesn't work."

**Quick Take**: Test with real users monthly—you'll find 80% of your most serious usability problems with just 3-5 test participants.

## Best Quotes
- "If something requires a large investment of time—or looks like it will—it's less likely to be used."
- "We don't make optimal choices. We satisfice. We choose the first reasonable option, a strategy known as satisficing."
- "Consistency is always a good thing to strive for within your site or app... But there will be cases where things will be clearer if you make them slightly inconsistent. Here's the rule to keep in mind: CLARITY TRUMPS CONSISTENCY."
- "The human brain's capacity doesn't change from one year to the next, so the insights from studying human behavior have a very long shelf life. What was difficult for users twenty years ago continues to be difficult today."
- "Making every page or screen self-evident is like having good lighting in a store: it just makes everything seem better."

## Action Items
- **Test your designs with real users monthly**: Recruit 3-5 people, give them realistic tasks, and observe where they struggle
- **Design for scanning, not reading**: Use clear headings, bullets, highlighted keywords, and plenty of white space
- **Follow established conventions**: Place logos in top-left, navigation across top or down left side, and use standard link colors
- **Create clear visual hierarchies**: Make the most important elements stand out visually
- **Eliminate unnecessary words**: Remove happy talk and instructions—your design should be self-explanatory
- **Make navigation obvious and persistent**: Users should always know where they are and how to get elsewhere
- **Apply the "Don't Make Me Think" test**: If you have to explain how something works, redesign it

## Questions to Consider
- Can someone understand what your site does and how to use it within 5 seconds of landing on it?
- Are you designing for how users actually behave (scanning, satisficing) rather than how you wish they'd behave?
- What conventions are you violating, and is the innovation worth the confusion it might cause?
- When was the last time you watched real users try to accomplish tasks on your site?
- What elements on your pages make users stop and think when they should just be able to act?

## Conclusion
"Don't Make Me Think, Revisited" is absolutely worth your time because it transforms complex usability principles into practical, actionable advice. The book's greatest strength is its focus on common sense rather than technical jargon—Krug demonstrates that good usability is mostly about thoughtful design rather than expensive technology or extensive research.

The biggest reason to read this book is that it will fundamentally change how you view digital design. After reading it, you'll never look at a website the same way again—you'll instantly recognize usability problems and understand how to fix them. In a world where users have endless alternatives and minimal patience, creating effortless experiences isn't just nice to have; it's essential for survival. This book provides the roadmap to get there.
