# Dual Momentum Investing: An Innovative Strategy for Higher Returns With Lower Risk
Author: Gary Antonacci

## Preface
- The Necessity for a Fresh Investment Paradigm
  - Traditional buy and hold strategy lacks effectiveness due to heightened volatility and abrupt risk spikes in diverse assets.
  - Even established entities like Berkshire Hathaway have encountered significant drops in market value.
  - Sole reliance on diversification proves inadequate in countering risk, as financial markets are now more interlinked and correlated.
  - Broad-ranging asset diversification fails to shield against severe market downturns, leading to overreactions and premature investment exits.
  - An innovative paradigm is imperative to adapt dynamically to market risks and provide insulation against turbulent markets.
  - The objective is to attain superior returns while constraining downside vulnerability.
  
- Utilizing Momentum Investment as a Resolution
  - To achieve the desired outcomes within the prevailing market conditions, momentum investing is proposed as a solution.
  - Momentum, or the persistence of performance, has been extensively examined for over two decades and is acknowledged as a viable strategy.
  - Momentum's effectiveness is backed by academic research spanning various asset classes and historical epochs.
  - Despite its recognition, momentum investing has yet to be widely explored by mainstream investors.
  - The intention of the book is to bridge the gap between academic momentum research and its practical implementation.
  
- Dual Momentum Investment: Global Equities Momentum (GEM)
  - Global Equities Momentum (GEM) combines strategies of relative strength and trend-following.
  - GEM is portrayed as a simple manifestation of dual momentum.
  - The approach involves employing a U.S. stock market index, a non-U.S. stock market index, and an aggregate bond index.
  - Historical testing reveals that GEM could have yielded long-term returns nearly double that of the global stock market over the past four decades, while evading substantial bear market losses.
  
- Emphasis on Safeguarding and Expanding Wealth
  - While individuals invest significant effort in accumulating wealth, strategies for preserving and growing it are often overlooked.
  - Warren Buffett's quote underscores the significance of comprehending investment risks.
  - The book seeks to rectify this situation by guiding readers towards a comprehensive understanding of wealth preservation and growth strategies.

## World's First Index Fund
- Index Funds and the Emergence of the Momentum Investment Concept
  - The popularity of index funds has grown significantly.
  - Although John McQuown and Bill Fouse were often attributed with launching the first index fund in 1971, the true origin story diverges.
  - The actual first index fund emerged from an unexpected encounter.
  - The narrative involves Bob Topol, who headed Harris Upham's OTC department, recounting an intriguing tale about his wife's investment approach.
  
- The Success of Dee's Strategy and Extracted Insights
  - Dee's investment strategy, championed by Bob's wife, defied conventions and yet proved highly effective.
  - She purchased stocks with "U.S." or "American" in their names, later expanding to encompass stocks with "General" in their names.
  - Her portfolio boasted advantages such as minimal transaction costs, limited turnover, and immunity to emotional market fluctuations.
  - Lessons garnered from Dee's strategy encompass the importance of cost efficiency, broad diversification, and the recognition of the challenge in consistently outperforming the market.
  
- Efficient Markets and Alternatives to Passive Investing
  - The efficient market hypothesis (EMH) gained prominence during the 1970s and 1980s.
  - EMH posited that prices incorporate all accessible public information, making it arduous to consistently surpass market performance.
  - Despite EMH's prevalence, practitioners like Warren Buffett and adept mutual fund managers were achieving success beyond its theoretical framework.
  - An analogy to Don Quixote underscores the difficulties in adhering to EMH or challenging its principles.
  
- A Shift in the Landscape and the Momentum Anomaly
  - In the 1990s, the rise of behavioral finance posed challenges to rational expectations and EMH.
  - Momentum gained attention as a phenomenon contradicting the tenets of EMH.
  - Behavioral factors and irrational behavior were identified as potential sources of predictable deviations between prices and fundamental values.
  - Even proponents of EMH, such as Eugene Fama and Kenneth French, acknowledged momentum as the "foremost anomaly."
  
- Further Exploration of the Momentum Anomaly
  - The momentum anomaly gained momentum itself due to the weakening grip of EMH.
  - Momentum's strength, persistence, and resistance to conventional risk factors intrigued scholars.
  - Academic momentum research countered the assertions of the efficient markets hypothesis.
  - Subsequent chapters in the book will delve into the historical development of momentum theory, its underlying logic, choices of assets, and alternative investment strategies.

## What Goes Up... Stays Up
- Classical Concepts:
  - Momentum signifies the inclination of investments to sustain their performance patterns.
  - Well-performing investments tend to maintain their positive trajectory, while underperformers continue their downward trend.
  - Momentum investing traces back to classical economic principles and finds its origins in history.
  - Classical economist David Ricardo highlighted the significance of both upward and downward momentum in investment choices.

- Momentum in the Early 20th Century:
  - Early 20th-century practices harbored the essence of momentum principles in trading.
  - The 1923 book "Reminiscences of a Stock Operator" offered insights from trader Jesse Livermore, advocating trend following and purchasing stocks at new highs.
  - Influential figures like Richard Wyckoff and George Seamans promoted momentum-based trading strategies during this era.
  - Quantitative methods like relative strength price momentum and moving averages gained traction in the 1920s.

- Momentum in the Mid-20th Century:
  - Momentum principles persisted in the mid-20th century, endorsed by individuals such as George Chestnutt and Jack Dreyfus.
  - Chestnutt underscored the significance of acquiring robust stocks leading market advances and highlighted the superior performance of leaders over laggards.
  - Jack Dreyfus, renowned as the Lion of Wall Street, achieved remarkable success through momentum strategies, influencing other investors.
  - Fidelity Management's Edward "Ned" Johnson II and Gerald Tsai further propagated momentum-based methods.

- Modern Interpretation of Momentum:
  - Momentum investing transitioned from discretionary to rule-based approaches with the rise of computerized studies.
  - Early work by Robert A. Levy on relative strength laid the groundwork for quantitative momentum techniques.
  - The term "momentum" replaced "relative strength" as practitioners embraced systematic momentum strategies.
  - Systematic, quantitative studies confirmed momentum's effectiveness across markets and assets, debunking concerns of data mining.

- Landmark Momentum Research:
  - In 1993, Jegadeesh and Titman's seminal research established momentum as a persistent market anomaly.
  - Their findings showcased the superiority of past winners over losers in the following months, coining the "momentum effect."
  - Further investigations corroborated this effect's resilience across time, markets, and asset classes.

- Additional Momentum Research:
  - Momentum has been the focus of over 300 academic papers, with more than 150 in recent years, exploring various facets.
  - This phenomenon's validity extends across diverse assets, including equities, bonds, commodities, currencies, and real estate.
  - Research demonstrates momentum's outperformance against other anomalies and its ability to persist beyond sample boundaries.
  - Momentum's defiance of the efficient market hypothesis has led to increased academic attention.

- Present Application of Momentum:
  - The mid-2000s witnessed the emergence of momentum-based programs and funds, democratizing momentum investing.
  - Companies like DWA, AQR, and BlackRock's iShares introduced publicly available momentum-oriented products.
  - These offerings leverage relative strength momentum for stock selection, yet they lack cross-asset diversification.
  - Absolute momentum, combining relative momentum with downside protection, presents improved returns and diminished risk exposure.

## Modern Portfolio Theory Principles and Practices
- Markowitz's Efficient Portfolio Construction:
  - In 1952, Harry Markowitz devised a method for constructing efficient portfolios aiming to maximize expected returns for a given risk level or minimize risk for a specified return.
  - This technique, known as Mean-Variance Optimization (MVO), employed factors like expected return, volatility, and correlation to determine optimal portfolio combinations.
  - MVO involved complex calculations and matrix inversions, especially for portfolios with numerous assets.

- Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM):
  - In the 1960s, CAPM emerged as a simplified alternative to MVO, connecting the excess return of assets or portfolios to the market index's excess return.
  - The model's beta coefficient indicated an asset's responsiveness to market movements and correlated risk.
  - Expected return of a security was proportionate to its beta-measured risk, and alpha represented excess profits beyond market risk.
  - CAPM faced limitations due to empirical challenges and assumptions like the normal distribution and independence of market prices.

- Black-Scholes Option Pricing:
  - The Black-Scholes option-pricing model was introduced in 1973, gaining attention for its equilibrium-based approach.
  - Despite its reliance on advanced mathematics, the model faced skepticism, particularly for extreme price fluctuations.
  - More practical models replaced Black-Scholes, addressing its accuracy concerns, especially during extreme market movements.

- Portfolio Insurance—Less Than Ideal:
  - Portfolio insurance, conceptualized by finance academics, aimed to adapt long exposure based on market shifts to replicate derivative-based hedging.
  - This concept backfired during market volatility, worsening fluctuations, notably during the 1987 stock market crash.
  - Portfolio insurance intensified market sell-offs and contributed to panic, escalating market corrections into full-scale panics.

- Advancements in Modern Finance:
  - Modern finance has brought notable progress, including diversification through constructing portfolios with a range of stocks to mitigate company-specific risks.
  - The proliferation of mutual funds and index funds was inspired by this principle of diversification.
  - The realization of high professional management costs spurred the development of cost-efficient index funds.
  - Behavioral finance emerged to explain gaps between theory and practice, helping investors comprehend psychological inclinations.
  - Momentum, an enduring market anomaly, gained significance as a strategy supported by extensive research and withstanding the test of time.

## Rational and Not-So-Rational Explanations of Momentum
- Understanding the Mechanisms of Momentum:
  - The effectiveness of momentum as an investment strategy is widely acknowledged, although the exact reasons behind its success have been debated.
  - Despite various explanations, a definitive answer to why momentum works remains elusive.
  - Unraveling the factors driving momentum's success holds implications for investor confidence, market dynamics, behavioral tendencies, and model enhancement.

- Rational Foundation for Momentum:
  - One viewpoint posits that momentum profits could be a reward for accepting elevated levels of risk, aligning with the efficient market's rational-based perspective.
  - According to this perspective, assuming more risk should yield greater profits to compensate for shouldering that risk.
  - However, conventional risk factors like size and value fail to account for momentum profits, prompting the quest for alternative risk factors.

- Risk-Centric Momentum Models:
  - Researchers have explored diverse risk factors to elucidate momentum profits, encompassing lagged macroeconomic indicators, stochastic growth shocks, industry-specific variables, and aggregate liquidity fluctuations.
  - Despite endeavors to link momentum with multiple risk factors, empirical observations have highlighted the inadequacy of traditional risk-based explanations.

- Behavioral Foundation for Momentum:
  - An alternate school of thought proposes that momentum profits arise from systematic and predictable investor behavior, driven by cognitive biases.
  - Behavioral finance challenges the efficient market hypothesis, contending that human psychology, rather than universally available information, influences market dynamics.
  - Psychological biases can lead to price deviations from their intrinsic values due to phenomena like underreaction, overreaction, herding, and other cognitive factors.

- Historical Underpinnings of Behavioral Modeling:
  - The intersection of social psychology and stock market investing has historical roots.
  - Prospect theory, introduced by Kahneman and Tversky, emphasized cognitive biases like loss aversion, where individuals assign greater weight to losses than gains.
  - Various systematic cognitive biases were identified, including anchoring, confirmation bias, herding, conservatism, overconfidence, and more.

- Anchoring and Underreaction:
  - Anchoring denotes the inclination to excessively emphasize initial information, causing individuals to resist revising their views based on new information.
  - This phenomenon can result in inertia, leading to underreaction to news and maintaining prices below their intrinsic value.
  - Initial price trends that emerge due to underreaction can endure over time, as prices align with their intrinsic value.

- Confirmation Bias:
  - Confirmation bias involves overemphasizing information that corroborates existing beliefs while disregarding contradictory data.
  - Investors influenced by confirmation bias may allocate more resources to securities that have recently performed well, amplifying price trends and sustaining momentum.

- Herding, Feedback Trading, and Overreaction:
  - DeLong et al. introduced a behavioral model explaining momentum profits by incorporating traders employing positive feedback strategies.
  - Positive feedback strategies entail buying during price increases and selling during declines, causing price overreaction and fostering momentum profits.
  - Herding, feedback trading, and overreaction further reinforce price trends, contributing to the momentum effect.

- Disposition Effect:
  - The disposition effect characterizes investors' tendency to sell winning stocks prematurely and hold onto losing stocks for extended periods.
  - Mental accounting, aversion to regret, lack of self-control, and tax considerations contribute to this behavior.
  - The disposition effect prolongs asset price adjustments and sustains momentum by hindering prices from reaching their true value due to premature selling.

- Synthesizing the Factors:
  - Cognitive biases like anchoring, confirmation bias, herding, and the disposition effect collectively underpin the momentum phenomenon.
  - The momentum strategy capitalizes on the cognitive biases inherent in human psychology, enabling investors to profit from these biases instead of being adversely impacted.
  - The intricate interplay of these biases helps elucidate the initial underreaction, persistent momentum, and delayed overreaction observed within markets.

## Asset Selection: The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly
- Bonds? Who Needs Them Anyway?:
  - The historical 200-year real return of U.S. stocks at 6.7% provides a robust investment foundation.
  - Bonds yield a more modest 3.8% real return, while non-U.S. equities fall in between.
  - While diversification is often advocated, excessive focus on it can result in mediocrity and higher costs.
  - Alternative assets like commodities, hedge funds, private equity, and active management might hinder progress.

- Risk Parity, Is It Worth It?:
  - The risk parity concept aims to balance asset allocation based on risk, not just market value.
  - Nevertheless, this approach can be unnecessarily intricate and may not consistently yield improved returns.
  - Overemphasizing risk parity could introduce unnecessary complexity into portfolios.

- Numerous Approaches to Diversification:
  - Diversification is widely promoted as a risk-mitigation strategy, yet excessive emphasis can lead to mediocre outcomes.
  - An overemphasis on diversification might result in higher fees and greater complexity without commensurate benefits.

- The Quest for International Diversification:
  - International diversification seeks to lower risk by investing across various global markets.
  - However, the advantages of international diversification might be constrained due to rising correlations among global markets.

- Exploring Emerging Markets:
  - Emerging markets offer growth prospects, but they also come with heightened volatility and risk.
  - Investing in emerging markets demands careful consideration and might not always yield superior returns.

- Passive Engagement with Commodity Futures:
  - Passive commodity futures investing involves tracking commodity indexes without active trading.
  - While this strategy provides exposure to commodity markets, its advantages may not be substantial.

- Managed Commodity Futures:
  - Managed commodity futures can contribute to diversification due to their non-correlation with traditional assets.
  - Commodity futures can hedge against supply shocks, though they might not be effective against broader economic shocks.

- The Landscape of Hedge Funds:
  - Hedge funds encompass a wide range of strategies with varying performance outcomes.
  - Numerous hedge funds did not fare well during the 1973-74 market crash and faced challenges in the 2008 financial crisis.
  - Elevated fees, limited transparency, and restricted liquidity pose obstacles in the hedge fund realm.
  - The diversification value of hedge funds has waned, and their correlation with the S&P 500 has risen.

- Navigating Private Equity:
  - Private equity includes long-term illiquid investment strategies like leveraged buyouts and venture capital.
  - Buyout funds historically yielded higher excess returns but have shown a decline in recent times.
  - Venture capital offers attractive returns but accompanies volatility, illiquidity, and survivorship risk.

- The Dynamics of Actively Managed Mutual Funds:
  - Actively managed mutual funds entail higher fees compared to passive index funds.
  - Extensive research indicates that actively managed funds frequently fall short of their benchmarks over time.
  - Elevated fees, frequent portfolio turnover, and tax inefficiencies contribute to lackluster performance in actively managed funds.

- Beyond Mutual Funds: Active Investment Management:
  - Active investment management outside the realm of mutual funds also struggles to consistently surpass benchmarks.
  - Competition, lack of informational advantages, and investor behavior pose challenges for active managers' success.
  - Investors often trade emotionally, hold underperforming stocks, and lack adequate diversification.

- Individual Investing and its Challenges:
  - Individual investors often lag behind benchmarks due to emotion-driven timing decisions.
  - Overconfidence, excessive trading, and insufficient diversification contribute to subpar performance.
  - Evidence suggests that a disciplined, rule-based approach could benefit individual investors.

- Riding the Dual Momentum Wave:
  - Dual momentum-driven selection of passive index funds can lead to successful investment outcomes.
  - Concentrating on low-cost equity and fixed-income index funds may suffice for the majority of investors.
  - Focusing excessively on diversification might introduce unnecessary complications and costs.


## Smart Beta and Other Urban Legends
- Characteristics of Intelligent Beta:
  - Intelligent beta refers to rule-based investment strategies that deviate from traditional market index capitalization weights.
  - These strategies aim to provide exposure to specific market segments, factors, or concepts through alternative weighting methods.
  - Intelligent beta aims to optimize risk-return trade-offs by utilizing metrics such as volatility, dividends, and market risk factors.
  - Examples of intelligent beta strategies encompass fundamentally weighted indexes, equal-weighted funds, and alternative factor-based approaches.
  - The global financial crisis in 2007-2008 prompted heightened interest in diversification and risk management, fueling the growth of intelligent beta strategies.
  - Intelligent beta ETFs gained substantial popularity, drawing in substantial investments and swiftly becoming a key part of the ETF market.

- Replicating Intelligent Beta Strategies:
  - Investors can replicate intelligent beta strategies using cost-effective factor-based ETFs.
  - Morningstar offers a method to identify a suitable benchmark portfolio for a particular intelligent beta ETF.
  - Subsequently, investors can search for an ETF that mirrors that benchmark to achieve a similar strategy.
  - Comparative evaluations should consider factors like annual portfolio turnover ratios and expense ratios.

- Maximizing the Potential of Intelligent Beta:
  - Some intelligent beta strategies may deliver more than just factor tilts and sector focus.
  - While these strategies are pricier than passive methods, they are more affordable than active strategies.
  - Intelligent beta strategies can be a consideration when there's a rational approach, robust backtesting, manageable transaction costs, acceptable volatility, and reasonable liquidity.
  - Caution is advised due to the limited historical backtest data and the potential for data-driven biases in constructing these strategies.

- The Significance of Size: (Size Premium)
  - The small-size premium, indicating that smaller stocks outperform larger ones, has diminished since the 1980s.
  - Increased involvement in small-cap stocks might have contributed to the diminishing relevance of the small-size premium.
  - This premium could potentially be a compensation for liquidity risk, as small-cap stocks have become more liquid over time.

- The Role of Value: (Value Premium)
  - The value premium, suggesting that value stocks outperform growth stocks, has been extensively studied and adopted.
  - Contemporary research challenges the consistent existence of a robust value premium within the realm of large-cap stocks.
  - The value premium might have been observable in specific periods but might lack consistent persistence.

- Analyzing Momentum: (Momentum Premium)
  - Cross-sectional stock momentum, indicating that recent outperformers continue to excel, has been a stable and significant anomaly.
  - Momentum has demonstrated persistent positive effects across various size categories and multiple 20-year sub-periods.
  - Consistent alphas from momentum strategies have ranged from 8.9% to 10.3% annually before accounting for transaction costs.
  - Momentum stands out as one of the most enduring and noteworthy market anomalies.

## Measuring and Managing Risk
- Grasping Absolute Momentum:
  - Absolute momentum entails assessing an asset's surplus return against its own past performance during a designated observation period.
  - A positive surplus return indicates positive absolute momentum (upward trend), whereas a negative surplus return indicates negative absolute momentum (downward trend).
  - Absolute momentum is relevant for individual assets and aids in identifying continuous trends, aligning with the concept that assets usually maintain their current trajectory.
  
- Traits of Absolute Momentum:
  - Absolute momentum epitomizes a fundamental trend-following tactic.
  - Its objective is to adhere to investment principles that prioritize safeguarding capital and promoting secure investing practices.

  - It contributes to increased diversification, reduced near-term portfolio volatility, and adeptly mitigates susceptibility to downturns during bear markets.

- Dual Momentum—Harmonizing Strengths:
  - Dual momentum entails merging relative and absolute momentum strategies.
  - It employs relative momentum to identify the asset with the strongest performance and then utilizes absolute momentum as a trend-following filter.
  - An asset with a positive surplus return, signifying an ascending trend, is chosen for investment.
  - In cases of a negative surplus return, denoting a descending trend, short- to intermediate-term fixed-income instruments are selected.
  - Dual momentum aligns investments with ongoing market trends.

- Tail Risk and Maximum Drawdown:
  - Financial market returns frequently possess non-normal distributions characterized by negative skewness.
  - Negative skewness introduces left tail risk, resulting in unforeseen losses and emotional strain.
  - Maximum drawdown gauges the pinnacle-to-valley retracement from a recent peak, offering insight into the most extensive cumulative decline.
  - Drawdowns hold significance in evaluating risk, particularly in terms of profundity, frequency, and duration.
  - Tail risk and maximum drawdown provide a glimpse into potential losses and assist in assessing risk profiles of strategies.

- An Integrated Approach:
  - Employing both quantitative and visual techniques to appraise strategies using diverse metrics and tools.

## Final Thoughts
- The Old Investment Paradigm:
  - The way professional investors perceive the market has been significantly influenced by quotes from renowned figures such as John Maynard Keynes and Warren Buffett.
  - This has often led to naive investment approaches taken by individual investors who place undue reliance on stock forecasters.
  - In this paradigm, overtrading, underdiversification, and common behavioral errors tend to plague individual investors, resulting in suboptimal outcomes.
  - Active investment management, while often accompanied by high fees, also tends to be plagued by similar behavioral biases.
  - Additionally, the reliance on fixed income as a means of reducing portfolio volatility has been a prominent feature.
  - However, bond-centric strategies have faced challenges in the context of the current low-interest-rate environment.
  - Traditional diversification strategies have shown limited effectiveness in the face of changing market dynamics.
  - Moreover, opportunities in value investing, small-cap investing, and smart beta have faced potential diminishing returns.
  - Passive index funds, despite their benefits, come with their own set of drawbacks within this old investment paradigm.

- The New Investment Paradigm:
  - In response to these challenges, the dual momentum paradigm has emerged as a novel alternative approach.
  - This paradigm seeks to harmonize investment strategies with the natural forces at play in the market through simple yet practical ideas.
  - It aims to address the phenomenon of myopic loss aversion and maximize long-term wealth accumulation.
  - A significant focus within this paradigm is placed on equities, particularly U.S. equities, to capture the higher-risk premium associated with them.
  - Strategic utilization of fixed income instruments comes into play predominantly during periods of equity market weakness.
  - This paradigm leverages the concept of relative strength momentum to exploit trends within the market itself.
  - Additionally, it incorporates the application of absolute momentum, a strategy aimed at mitigating the impact of substantial drawdowns.
  - The overarching goal of this new approach is to achieve higher expected returns while maintaining a lower level of expected risk.
  - An essential aspect of this paradigm is its ability to mitigate the impact of emotional and behavioral biases through the use of dual momentum.
  - Furthermore, it aims to align market exposure with changing market regimes and the inherent biases of investors.

- The Continuing Effectiveness of Momentum:
  - The historical track record of momentum, which has consistently outperformed over a span of 200 years across various markets and asset classes, attests to its continued effectiveness.
  - As more investors adopt the dual momentum approach, there is speculation about the potential impact this collective shift could have on momentum's performance.
  - Deep-seated behavioral biases within human psychology contribute significantly to the enduring persistence of momentum as a successful strategy.
  - Given the inherent resistance of human nature to substantial shifts in investment behavior, it is unlikely that the majority of investors will embrace enthusiastic momentum investing.
  
- Challenges and Opportunities:
  - Despite its effectiveness, the dual momentum approach may encounter periods of underperformance, necessitating a careful approach to navigate through such phases.
  - Successfully addressing challenges related to patience and discipline is crucial in ensuring the long-term viability of the strategy.
  - The human inclination to tinker with strategies in an attempt to enhance them can often lead to counterproductive outcomes.
  - A meta-analysis of models versus expert judgment underscores the superiority of disciplined models in the investment domain.
  - Notably, the advice of Jim Simons resonates strongly here, emphasizing the importance of adhering to models regardless of personal opinions.
  - The key to achieving sustained success lies in sticking to proven and disciplined approaches that have stood the test of time.
  - The dual momentum approach's ability to aptly respond to market forces underscores its significance in maintaining consistent investment success.
  - Recognizing and practicing psychological discipline is paramount in realizing the full potential of this strategy.
  
- All Aboard!:
  - Metaphorically speaking, momentum is likened to an express train that propels investments forward.
  - The primary vehicle for wealth generation is symbolized by the "Equities Special," emphasizing the central role of equities in achieving substantial returns.
  - As the investment landscape evolves, adapting to faster-moving trains while also seeking safer options becomes imperative.
  - The utilization of the "Treasury" Bill during market reversals reflects the strategy's readiness to incorporate slow and steady approaches when necessary.
  - A conscious effort is made to avoid the pitfalls associated with actively engineered and inefficient strategies.
  - The approach steers clear of the "Buy and Behold Line," representing an erratic approach that is best avoided.
  - The investment journey is depicted as navigating through hills and valleys, acknowledging the challenges that come with it.
  - The fall and struggles of alternative investment vehicles underscore the need for a more effective approach.
  - The metaphorical arrival at "Dante's Station" underscores potential pitfalls that may emerge on the investment path.
  - Ultimately, embracing the "Dual Momentum Route" is advocated as a consistent and reliable means to achieve investment success.
