# The Wastewater Gardener
**Authors**: Mark Nelson, PhD, Tony Juniper (Foreword) | **Year**: 2014 | **Category**: Science & Nature

## Summary
"The Wastewater Gardener" presents a revolutionary approach to wastewater management that transforms human waste from a pollution problem into a valuable resource. Drawing from his experience as a biospherian in Biosphere 2 and decades of implementing ecological solutions worldwide, Nelson argues that our current sewage systems represent one of modern civilization's most wasteful and unsustainable practices. The book demonstrates how constructed wetlands and "Wastewater Gardens" can recycle sewage while creating beautiful ecosystems, conserving water, and returning nutrients to the soil.

This book is essential reading for environmentalists, engineers, policy makers, and anyone interested in sustainable solutions. Readers will gain practical knowledge about ecological engineering, understand the global water crisis, and discover how individual actions can contribute to planetary health.

## Core Insights

### The Global Sewage Crisis
Modern flush toilet systems represent an ecological disaster. We use precious drinking water (10,000 gallons per person annually) to transport human waste, then spend enormous amounts of energy and money treating it before polluting our waterways. The book reveals that conventional sewage systems waste 1,000-2,000 tons of water to remove just one ton of human excrement, while valuable nutrients (5-7% nitrogen, 3-5% phosphorus) that could fertilize crops are instead flushed into oceans causing dead zones and algal blooms.

> "The solution to pollution is dilution" was the old mantra of sanitary engineers. But with billions of people and growing water scarcity, there simply isn't enough water to dilute our problems away."

**Quick Take**: Our current sewage infrastructure was designed when water seemed unlimited and pollution appeared minor. Today it's fundamentally unsustainable.

### Wastewater Gardens: Nature's Solution
Nelson pioneered Wastewater Gardens® – engineered ecosystems that use wetland plants, soil microbes, and natural processes to treat sewage while creating beautiful gardens. These subsurface flow wetlands use gravel beds planted with wetland vegetation (canna lilies, reeds, papyrus) where wastewater flows through root zones that filter and purify the water. The systems are odorless, require minimal maintenance, and can treat all household wastewater while creating lush landscapes that attract birds and beneficial wildlife.

> "Channels of water flowing between willows, water hyacinths, lilies, rushes and cattails, with the cleaning function of roots and microbes harnessed in the purification of water, could almost not be more different from high-tech centralized wastewater treatment facilities."

**Quick Take**: Constructed wetlands work with nature rather than against it, turning waste treatment from an industrial problem into a garden solution.

### The Fecesphere: Understanding Nutrient Cycles
Nelson introduces the concept of the "fecesphere" – the global system of nutrient cycling through excrement that sustains life on Earth. Unlike wild animals that contribute to their local ecosystems, humans break this natural cycle by concentrating waste and flushing nutrients into oceans. Traditional cultures in Asia understood this reality, treating "night soil" as valuable fertilizer that maintained soil fertility for centuries. The book argues that reconnecting human waste to agricultural cycles is essential for sustainable food production.

> "All of life is interconnected. Life is like a planetary supermarket with all organic materials on sale, with buyers for each and every item. In this market, though, the buyers are also on sale."

**Quick Take**: Human waste isn't waste – it's a concentrated package of the nutrients that plants need to grow the food we eat.

### Decentralized vs. Centralized Systems
The book contrasts centralized sewage treatment (enormous plants, miles of pipes, massive energy consumption) with decentralized solutions that treat wastewater where it's generated. Decentralized systems are more resilient, cost-effective, and environmentally friendly. They eliminate the need to pump waste long distances, allow for community-scale solutions, and enable water reuse for local irrigation. Nelson demonstrates through projects in Mexico, Australia, Bali, and Algeria that small-scale solutions can work effectively in diverse cultural and environmental contexts.

**Quick Take**: Local solutions are almost always better than massive centralized systems for both environmental and economic reasons.

### From Problem to Resource
The fundamental paradigm shift needed is viewing wastewater not as waste but as a resource containing water, nutrients, and organic matter. The book outlines practical steps for this transformation: composting toilets for dry waste separation, graywater recycling for irrigation, wetland treatment for blackwater, and returning processed nutrients to agriculture. This approach addresses multiple crises simultaneously – water scarcity, soil depletion, nutrient pollution, and energy waste.

> "Nature does not do waste, and if we wish to endure, then neither should we."

**Quick Take**: The solution is changing our mindset from waste disposal to resource recovery.

## Best Quotes

- "Anyone starting out from scratch to plan a civilization would hardly have designed such a monster as our collective sewage system. Its existence gives additional point to the sometimes asked question, Is there any evidence of intelligent life on the planet Earth?"

- "Nature does not do waste, and if we wish to endure, then neither should we."

- "We change the world one small step at a time, one flush at a time."

- "The sphere of shit helps sustain the biosphere... Fresh, it's a valuable resource."

- "Human shit is not a toxic waste product and should not be treated as if it were. Throwing away vast amounts of potable water is increasingly untenable in a world facing a shortage of fresh water."

## Action Items

- **Investigate your local sewage system**: Find out where your wastewater goes and how it's treated. Most people have no idea what happens after they flush.

- **Install water-efficient fixtures**: Low-flow toilets, showerheads, and appliances can reduce water consumption by 30-50%.

- **Consider graywater recycling**: Simple systems can reuse water from showers and sinks for landscape irrigation, reducing water demand.

- **Support composting initiatives**: Whether backyard composting or municipal programs, returning organic matter to soil is crucial for ecosystem health.

- **Advocate for better policies**: Support decentralized wastewater treatment, industrial waste separation, and nutrient recycling programs in your community.

- **Practice "fecesphere meditation"**: Each time you use the toilet, consider where your water comes from and where your waste goes – this mindfulness is the first step to change.

## Questions to Consider

- Why do we use drinking water to flush toilets when it's not necessary for the function?

- What would your community look like if sewage treatment was replaced with beautiful wetland gardens?

- How did traditional cultures manage human waste sustainably for centuries, and what can we learn from them?

- If industrial wastewater wasn't mixed with domestic sewage, how would that change treatment approaches and costs?

- What role does psychological aversion play in our unsustainable sewage practices, and how can we overcome it?

## Conclusion
"The Wastewater Gardener" is both an eye-opening critique of our current sewage paradigm and an inspiring guide to practical alternatives. Nelson combines scientific expertise, hands-on experience, and engaging storytelling to make a potentially unpleasant subject fascinating and compelling. The book's greatest strength is demonstrating that ecological solutions can be more beautiful, cost-effective, and sustainable than conventional approaches.

This book is definitely worth your time if you care about environmental issues, sustainable living, or practical solutions to global problems. The biggest reason to read it is that it transforms how you see one of the most fundamental aspects of daily life – something we all do every day but rarely think about. Nelson shows that by changing how we handle our waste, we can address water scarcity, soil depletion, nutrient pollution, and energy waste simultaneously. Most importantly, he offers hope that individual and community actions can create meaningful change, one flush at a time.
