# Traction: A Startup Guide to Getting Customers
**Authors**: Gabriel Weinberg, Justin Mares | **Year**: 2014 | **Category**: Business & Finance

## Summary
"Traction" is a systematic approach to customer acquisition that every startup needs but most founders neglect. The authors argue that traction equals growth, and the pursuit of traction is what truly defines a startup. Most startups fail because they build great products but can't get customers. This book provides a comprehensive framework called the Bullseye Framework to help startups identify and test the right marketing channels among 19 possible options.

The book's central premise is that startups should spend 50% of their time on product development and 50% on traction testing, rather than building a product first and then worrying about customers later. This parallel approach ensures that when your product is ready, you already have proven channels to scale your growth.

Perfect for startup founders, marketers, and entrepreneurs who struggle with customer acquisition, this book provides actionable strategies that have worked for successful companies like DuckDuckGo, Mint, and Reddit.

## Core Insights

### The Bullseye Framework
The Bullseye Framework is a five-step process for finding and focusing on the most effective traction channels:

1. **Brainstorm**: Come up with at least one idea for each of the 19 traction channels, systematically overcoming your biases toward familiar channels
2. **Rank**: Organize all channels into three tiers - promising (inner circle), potential, and long-shot
3. **Prioritize**: Select the top three channels from your promising tier to test
4. **Test**: Run cheap, quick experiments on your top three channels to see which shows real promise
5. **Focus**: Double down on the channel that shows the best results and scale it aggressively

> "The Bullseye Framework is designed to force you to take all traction channels more seriously than you would otherwise. This is accomplished via the brainstorm step and then again by forcing you to think about all of the channels."

**Quick Take**: Most founders only consider channels they're familiar with, but breakthrough growth often comes from unexpected channels that competitors dismiss.

### The 50% Rule
The book's most counterintuitive recommendation is the 50% Rule: spend equal time on product development and traction testing from day one.

> "Having a product your early customers love but no clear way to get more traction is frustrating. To address this frustration, spend your time building product and testing traction channels – in parallel."

**Quick Take**: Start testing traction channels before you even have a finished product. This gives you invaluable insights and a head start on growth when you launch.

### The 19 Traction Channels
The book identifies 19 distinct channels for getting traction:

**Traditional Channels:**
- **Viral Marketing**: Growing through user referrals and viral loops
- **Public Relations (PR)**: Getting coverage from traditional media outlets
- **Search Engine Marketing (SEM)**: Paid advertising on search engines
- **Social & Display Ads**: Visual advertising on social platforms and websites
- **Offline Ads**: Traditional advertising (TV, radio, print)
- **Search Engine Optimization (SEO)**: Organic search traffic through content
- **Sales**: Direct selling processes for high-value products

**Unconventional Channels:**
- **Unconventional PR**: Stunts and exceptional customer service that generates buzz
- **Content Marketing**: Creating valuable content to attract customers
- **Email Marketing**: Building and nurturing email lists
- **Engineering as Marketing**: Building free tools that drive leads
- **Targeting Blogs**: Getting featured in niche blogs

> "Get one channel working that your competitors dismiss, and you can grow rapidly while they languish."

**Quick Take**: Every single one of these channels has worked for both enterprise and consumer startups - don't dismiss any channel without testing it.

### The Critical Path
Your Critical Path is the sequence of milestones that will get you to your next traction goal. Instead of working on everything at once, identify the absolutely necessary steps and focus only on the current step(s) on your path.

> "Once you've defined your critical path, it's easy to determine the direction to go in – just follow the path! In particular, work on the first step(s) and nothing else."

**Quick Take**: Define and prioritize milestones at the company, department, and individual level to ensure everyone works efficiently toward the right goals.
