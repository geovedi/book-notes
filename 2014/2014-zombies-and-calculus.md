**Authors**: Colin Adams | **Year**: 2014 | **Category**: Science & Nature

## Summary
"Zombies and Calculus" is a wildly creative educational novel that follows Craig Williams, a mathematics professor at a small liberal arts college in New England, as he uses calculus to survive a zombie apocalypse. When a late-arriving student shows up to Williams' calculus class with an unusual hunger for brains rather than knowledge, the zombie outbreak begins. As civilization crumbles around them, Williams and his small band of survivors must apply mathematical concepts to outsmart and defeat the undead hordes.

This innovative book transforms abstract calculus concepts into practical survival tools, making advanced mathematics accessible and engaging through a thrilling zombie narrative. The story unfolds over 24 hours of the apocalypse, with each chapter representing a specific hour where new mathematical challenges emerge.

This book is perfect for students who find traditional calculus textbooks dry, educators looking for creative teaching methods, or anyone who enjoys seeing practical applications of mathematical concepts in extreme situations. Readers will gain a deeper understanding of calculus while being entertained by a clever zombie survival story.

## Core Insights

### Using Tangent Vectors for Zombie Evasion
Zombies always point their tangent vector toward their intended target, creating predictable movement patterns that can be mathematically analyzed. This fundamental insight allows survivors to calculate optimal escape routes by understanding the directional derivatives of zombie movement.

> "Zombies always point their tangent vector toward their target. They don't think about it, they just do it."

**Quick Take**: By treating zombie movement as a mathematical vector function, you can predict their paths and find escape angles that maximize your survival chances.

### Exponential Growth and Viral Spread
The zombie virus spreads exponentially, allowing survivors to use calculus to predict infection rates and plan strategic responses. The basic reproductive rate (R₀) determines whether the outbreak will grow or die out.

> "When R₀ is greater than 1, we have an epidemic. When it's less than 1, the infection dies out."

**Quick Take**: Understanding exponential growth helps you recognize critical tipping points in zombie population dynamics and human survival odds.

### Logistic Growth Models
As resources become scarce and zombie populations saturate areas, the outbreak follows logistic growth patterns rather than pure exponential growth. This creates predictable carrying capacity limits that survivors can exploit.

**Quick Take**: Logistic models show that zombie populations will eventually plateau, creating strategic windows for survivor action.

### Predator-Prey Dynamics
The relationship between humans and zombies follows classic predator-prey mathematical models. These coupled differential equations reveal oscillating population patterns that long-term survivors can understand and potentially influence.

**Quick Take**: Like foxes and rabbits, human and zombie populations naturally oscillate—understanding these cycles helps predict population crashes and booms.

### Gravitational Physics in Combat
Understanding gravitational acceleration and projectile motion helps survivors optimize weapon trajectories, whether throwing objects or calculating bullet paths when engaging zombies at different elevations.

**Quick Take**: Basic physics calculations turn thrown objects into precision weapons against the undead.

## Best Quotes
- "How can calculus help you survive the zombie apocalypse? Demonstrates how in this zombie adventure novel."
- "If you are squeamish, you should not read this book. Of course, there's little likelihood that you are squeamish, considering that you are even reading this at all."
- "I would not be here today if it were not for calculus. Maybe it will help you to stay alive a little longer, too."
- "Sometimes the conversations I recorded here become more technical. When that is the case, I have moved the more sophisticated parts."
- "It's about change. It's about measuring change. You know, how fast something changes."
