## Core Insights

### Proximity Teaches Us What We Need to Know
Stevenson discovered that you can't understand justice from a distance. His grandmother taught him to "Keep close," and this principle guided his life's work. Only by getting proximate to those who are suffering, incarcerated, and condemned can we truly understand their humanity and the injustices they face.

> "You can't understand most of the important things from a distance, Bryan. You have to get close."

**Quick Take**: Real change happens when we move beyond abstract concerns and engage directly with people affected by injustice.

### Each Person Is More Than Their Worst Act
One of the book's most powerful themes is that human beings cannot be reduced to their worst mistakes. Stevenson demonstrates how even those who have committed terrible crimes retain their capacity for growth, change, and redemption.

> "Each of us is more than the worst thing we've ever done."

**Quick Take**: True justice recognizes the complexity and potential for growth in every human being, rather than permanently defining people by their worst moments.

### The Opposite of Poverty Is Justice
Stevenson reframes our understanding of poverty, arguing that it's not just about lack of wealth but about lack of justice. The poor are disproportionately affected by unjust policies, inadequate legal representation, and systemic bias.

> "The opposite of poverty is not wealth; the opposite of poverty is justice."

**Quick Take**: Addressing systemic injustice is fundamental to addressing poverty and inequality in our society.

### We All Need Mercy and Unmerited Grace
The book argues that mercy is not weakness but strength, and that recognizing our own need for grace helps us extend it to others. Even the most upright among us have moments where we need understanding and forgiveness.

> "The closer we get to mass incarceration and extreme levels of punishment, the more I believe it's necessary to recognize that we all need mercy, we all need justice, and—perhaps—we all need some measure of unmerited grace."

**Quick Take**: A healthy society balances accountability with compassion, recognizing that everyone benefits from systems that allow for redemption.

### The System Is Broken by Design
Stevenson reveals how the criminal justice system is structured to punish rather than rehabilitate, with policies that disproportionately harm the poor and minorities. From mandatory minimums to three-strikes laws, the system often creates lifelong punishments for minor mistakes.

**Quick Take**: Understanding systemic problems helps us move beyond blaming individuals to addressing the root causes of injustice.
