# Dual Momentum Investing
**Authors**: Gary Antonacci | **Year**: 2014

## Summary

"Dual Momentum Investing" presents a revolutionary approach to achieving superior returns with lower risk by combining two powerful forms of momentum: relative momentum (comparing assets to each other) and absolute momentum (comparing assets to their own past performance). Antonacci introduces his Global Equities Momentum (GEM) strategy, which uses just three simple ETFs to potentially double market returns while cutting risk by two-thirds. This data-backed approach challenges traditional buy-and-hold wisdom and offers investors a rules-based system that protects against bear market devastation while capturing upside potential.

**Who benefits**: Individual investors seeking better risk-adjusted returns, financial advisors looking for systematic approaches, and anyone frustrated by traditional buy-and-hold volatility. **What they'll gain**: A clear, implementable strategy that has historically achieved 17.43% annual returns with 22.7% maximum drawdown versus market returns with much larger losses.

## Core Insights

### The Momentum Anomaly
Momentum is the "premier anomaly" in finance—validated by over 200 years of data across all asset classes. It's simple: investments that have performed well tend to continue performing well, while poor performers continue to struggle. Despite overwhelming academic evidence, momentum remains largely unused by mainstream investors, creating a powerful opportunity for those who understand it.

> "Momentum, or persistence in performance, has been one of the most heavily researched finance topics over the past 20 years. Academic research has shown momentum to be a valid strategy from the early 1800s up to the present, and across nearly all asset classes."

**Quick Take**: Momentum isn't just theory—it's a persistent market reality that smart investors can harness.

### Dual Momentum: The Game Changer
The breakthrough innovation is combining relative and absolute momentum. Relative momentum picks the best-performing asset class (U.S. vs. international stocks), while absolute momentum determines overall market health by comparing performance to risk-free assets (bonds). This dual approach captures upside while avoiding major bear markets.

> "Absolute momentum aims to beat the market by avoiding the beatings."

**Quick Take**: Use momentum to choose what to own AND when to own it—this combination is the secret sauce.

### The GEM Strategy: Simple Yet Powerful
Global Equities Momentum uses only three assets: U.S. stocks (S&P 500), international stocks (ACWI ex-U.S.), and aggregate bonds. The rules are simple: monthly, compare U.S. vs. international performance over the past 12 months. Invest in the winner, but only if it also outperformed Treasury bills. Otherwise, stay in bonds.

> "Using only a U.S. stock market index, an all world non-U.S. stock market index, and an aggregate bond index, I show how investors using GEM could have achieved long-run returns nearly twice as high as the world stock market over the past 40 years while avoiding severe bear market losses."

**Quick Take**: Complexity isn't necessary—three assets and one simple rule can deliver extraordinary results.

### The Power of Loss Avoidance
The magic behind GEM's performance isn't just higher returns—it's dramatically smaller drawdowns. By avoiding bear market devastation (40-50% losses), investors don't need to spend years recovering. GEM's maximum drawdown was only 22.7% versus over 55% for buy-and-hold strategies.

> "Not having to recoup bear market losses is what contributed greatly to GEM's extraordinary returns."

**Quick Take**: Protecting against losses is as important as capturing gains—maybe more so.

### Behavioral Discipline Made Systematic
The greatest advantage of momentum investing is that it's rules-based, removing destructive emotional decisions. Most investors buy high and sell low due to fear and greed. A systematic approach forces discipline when it matters most.

> "Many individual investors lose consistently by trading, an achievement that a dart-throwing monkey could not match. A disciplined, quantitative approach to investing can reduce the influence of 'animal spirits' and help provide consistent results."

**Quick Take**: Let rules, not emotions, drive your investment decisions—especially during market extremes.

## Best Quotes
- "Buy and hold doesn't work anymore. The volatility is too significant. Almost any asset can suddenly become much more risky."
- "Momentum is powerful, persistent, and not explainable by any of the commonly known risk factors."
- "It may be that the race is not always to the swift, nor the battle to the strong, but that's the way to bet."
- "Investing is simple but not easy."
- "What we need now is a new paradigm that dynamically adjusts to market risk and keeps us safe from the vagaries of today's highly volatile markets."

## Action Items
- **Set up monthly momentum reviews**: Compare U.S. vs. international stocks using 12-month performance
- **Implement absolute momentum filter**: Only invest in equities when they beat Treasury bills
- **Choose low-cost ETFs**: Use Vanguard or similar funds for the three asset classes
- **Automate your strategy**: Remove emotion by making it purely systematic
- **Prepare for underperformance periods**: Momentum sometimes lags during sharp rebounds from bear markets

## Questions to Consider
- Are you willing to underperform during strong bull market recoveries to avoid devastating bear market losses?
- Can you maintain discipline in a rules-based system even when emotions urge you to deviate?
- How would doubling your long-term returns while cutting volatility change your financial future?
- Are you using complexity as a barrier to implementing what actually works?
- What behavioral biases have hurt your past investment performance?

## Conclusion

**Is this worth your time?** Absolutely—especially if you've ever suffered through a major bear market or wondered why your returns don't match market benchmarks. Antonacci provides a practical, data-backed solution to one of investing's oldest challenges: how to capture market gains while avoiding catastrophic losses.

**The biggest reason to read this book**: It offers a complete, actionable strategy that has historically delivered exceptional results with a simple approach anyone can implement.
