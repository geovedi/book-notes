## Summary
"Small Giants" profiles companies that deliberately chose to be great rather than big, challenging the conventional business wisdom that growth is always the ultimate goal. Through fourteen case studies of privately-held companies across various industries, Burlingham reveals how these businesses built exceptional organizations by prioritizing values like community connection, employee relationships, customer intimacy, and operational excellence over revenue growth and market domination. These "small giants" maintained human-scale operations where leaders could remain connected to all aspects of their business, fostering what the book calls "mojo"—that elusive quality of authenticity, purpose, and soul that makes companies truly remarkable.

This book is perfect for entrepreneurs, business owners, and leaders who feel pressure to grow constantly and wonder if there's another way. It offers a compelling blueprint for building businesses that prioritize purpose over profit, relationships over scale, and long-term sustainability over short-term expansion—showing that success can be defined on your own terms.

## Core Insights

### The Choice to Be Great Instead of Big
The foundational insight is that successful businesses inevitably face a critical choice point where they must decide whether to pursue aggressive growth or maintain their current scale and focus on excellence. Unlike the prevailing business mantra that you must "grow or die," these companies demonstrated that choosing greatness over size can lead to more fulfilling and sustainable success.

Fritz Maytag of Anchor Brewing had this revelation when planning an IPO in 1992. He realized he could build "a small, prestigious, profitable business" that would be "all right" rather than chasing growth that would sacrifice what he valued most. Similarly, Gary Erickson of Clif Bar walked away from a $120 million acquisition deal, having a panic attack that made him realize his company was "his place in the world" and couldn't be sacrificed.

> "I've made much more money by choosing the right things to say no to than by choosing things to say yes to." — Danny Meyer, Union Square Hospitality Group

**Quick Take**: Growth pressure is inevitable, but recognizing you have a choice is the first step to building business on your own terms.

### The Power of Mojo
Burlingham identifies "mojo" as the elusive quality that sets these companies apart—it's the combination of authenticity, emotional connection, and sense of purpose that makes businesses magnetic to customers, employees, and communities. Mojo is generated by staying true to your values rather than chasing growth at all costs.

Gary Erickson discovered this concept when a competitor noted that Clif Bar had "mojo" while their rival had "lost it." He conducted exercises asking employees to identify companies that had lost their mojo and why, finding common themes: losing creativity as they grew, becoming too commercial, ignoring community relationships, and getting too big too fast.

> "To me mojo means, 'You got that engine running baby and the sky is the limit!'" — Clif Bar employee

**Quick Take**: Mojo is fragile and must be protected—it's the byproduct of staying authentic and connected to your purpose as you scale.

### Human Scale Operations
Small giants operate at "human scale"—a size where leaders can still know everyone, maintain personal relationships, and preserve the company culture. Typically, this means keeping the organization small enough that the CEO can meet new hires, employees feel connected to the entire company, and personal relationships can be maintained with customers and suppliers.

This scale allows for what Danny Meyer calls "active, meaningful dialogue with stakeholders" that creates business soul. Companies like Reell Precision Manufacturing (with just under 200 employees) and O.C. Tanner (with about 1,900 employees) demonstrate that human scale isn't just about headcount—it's about maintaining connection and community regardless of size.

> "Walking around here and talking to your people, I get a feeling from them that I'd like to take back into my company, but I know we can never do that." — Richard Reese, CEO of Iron Mountain, visiting CitiStorage

**Quick Take**: Human scale isn't a limitation—it's a strategic advantage that enables deeper relationships and stronger culture.

### Community Connection and Belonging
Each small giant maintains an extraordinarily intimate relationship with their local community that goes far beyond typical corporate philanthropy. This relationship is a two-way street where the community helps shape the business character while the company plays a vital role in community life.

Zingerman's in Ann Arbor doesn't just sell to locals—they contribute to the community's identity. Anchor Brewing helped transform San Francisco's SOMA district. CitiStorage became a Brooklyn institution. These connections create loyalty, support during difficult times, and a sense of shared purpose that transcends typical business transactions.

> "The community helped mold the character of the business, just as the companies played an important role in the life of the community."

**Quick Take**: Deep community roots provide stability, purpose, and a competitive advantage that chains can't replicate.

### Intimacy with Customers and Suppliers
Small giants cultivate exceptionally close relationships with customers and suppliers based on personal contact, mutual commitment, and authentic connection. Leaders themselves model this behavior by staying accessible and engaged rather than hiding behind layers of management.

Righteous Babe Records built direct relationships with fans, allowing Ani DiFranco to remain independent while building a dedicated following. Zingerman's customers send fan mail and treat the deli as part of their personal history. These companies don't just have customers—they have advocates who feel personally connected to their success.

**Quick Take**: Personal relationships with customers and suppliers create moats that competitors can't cross with price or convenience alone.

### Functional Little Societies
Small giants view themselves as "functional little societies" that address employees' needs as whole people—creative, emotional, spiritual, and social needs as well as economic ones. They create workplaces where people are treated with respect, dignity, integrity, fairness, kindness, and generosity.

Reell Precision Manufacturing operates like a corporate democracy with two CEOs. CitiStorage's Elaine Brodsky teaches customer service classes to employees. These companies invest in developing their people not just as workers but as human beings, creating loyalty and engagement that drives performance.

> "They were places where employees felt cared for in the totality of their lives, where they were treated in the way that the founders and leaders thought people ought to be treated." — Bo Burlingham

**Quick Take**: When companies treat employees as whole people rather than resources, they unlock discretionary effort and authentic engagement.

## Conclusion

"Small Giants" is a revolutionary business book because it challenges the fundamental assumption that growth is always good and bigger is always better. Burlingham shows through compelling case studies that companies can choose greatness over growth and build more sustainable, fulfilling, and ultimately successful businesses on their own terms.

This book is worth reading because it gives business leaders permission to define success differently. In an era of unicorn-chasing and growth-at-all-costs mentality, "Small Giants" offers a counterintuitive but proven alternative: build businesses that prioritize purpose, people, and community over pure financial metrics. The companies profiled prove that you can be both highly profitable and deeply principled—achieving financial success as a byproduct of pursuing excellence rather than as the primary goal.

The biggest takeaway is that you have more choices than you think. When pressure for growth inevitably comes, you can say no to opportunities that would compromise your values. You can build a business that enriches your life rather than consumes it. You can create something that matters beyond its balance sheet. That's the real power of choosing to be great instead of big.
