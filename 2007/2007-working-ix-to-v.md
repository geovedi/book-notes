## Core Insights

### 1. The Ancient World Was Surprisingly Modern
The Roman Empire operated like an early version of the European Union, with shared laws, currencies, and two lingua francas (Latin and Greek). Workers put in eight-hour days from dawn to 3 PM, dealt with taxation, socialized through work associations, and even had something resembling weekends—135 holidays per year by AD 165, expanding to 177 by AD 354.

> "Two thousand years ago, a world uncannily like ours moved at a hustle, its people working a jaw-dropping assortment of jobs to earn their daily bread."

**Quick Take**: The fundamental aspects of work life—wages, working conditions, workplace gossip, and complaining about management—are timeless human experiences.

### 2. Slavery Was the Engine of the Ancient Economy
The biggest difference between their world and ours wasn't technology but labor structure. The Greco-Roman economy ran on millions of slaves called "servus" (source of our word "servant"). Pirates were major suppliers, with the Greek island of Delos capable of processing 10,000 slaves per day. This human tool system made their version of industry and construction possible.

> "Instead of relying on combustion engines and high technology, they used living tools: millions of human beings, male and female, young and old."

**Quick Take**: Ancient achievements were built on human exploitation at a scale that's almost unimaginable today, yet the economic principles remain recognizable.

### 3. Entertainment Was Big Business
The ancient world had massive entertainment industries—celebrity chariot racing, theatrical productions, gladiator games, and musical performances. The public baths alone were the biggest civilian employer, with thousands of locations across the empire. Gladiators were essentially professional athletes with training schools, specialized diets, and celebrity status.

> "Most of the criminals became 'arena fodder,' thrown to the aforementioned beasts or killed in some unspeakable way."

**Quick Take**: Spectator sports and entertainment have always been huge economic drivers, with celebrity culture and fan devotion nothing new.

### 4. Sex Work Was Organized and Regulated
The ancient Greeks created a tiered system of prostitution that resembled modern business models. Solon established state-sponsored brothels with one-obol minimum service fees, while high-end "hetaerae" operated as independent companions. Like phone hookup programs, it had diverse sales channels and plans for every budget.

> "Like phone hookup programs today, the Greek system of sexual hooking up was arranged in tiers, with diverse sales channels, lots of point-of-purchase spots, and plans to fit every budget."

**Quick Take**: Sex work has always been a regulated industry with market segmentation, from budget options to premium services.

### 5. Small Business Drove the Economy
Fast-food franchises, wine shops, signwriters, town criers, tattoo removers, and armpit pluckers kept the economy rolling. There were legitimate "dodgier gigs" like auctioneers, gladiator trainers, and accusation specialists. Every town had bakers, barbers, and various service providers—much like our local business ecosystems.

> "Small businesses thrived everywhere. Fast-food franchises, wine shops, and service jobs like signwriters, town criers, anointers, tattoo removers, and armpit pluckers kept the economy rolling."

**Quick Take**: The backbone of any economy has always been small, local businesses providing essential services.
