## The Story in Brief

### Part 1: Days of Innocence and Hope
Virginia Vallejo, a prominent Colombian TV presenter, arrives at what she thinks is a weekend getaway at a luxurious hacienda. Instead, she encounters Pablo Escobar, who immediately becomes fascinated by her. Despite being engaged to Aníbal Turbay (nephew of a former president), Vallejo finds herself drawn to Escobar's charisma, intelligence, and overwhelming power. Their relationship begins against the backdrop of Colombia's violent political landscape, where guerrilla groups, drug cartels, and government forces battle for control.

### Part 2: Days of Glory and Horror
As their relationship deepens, Vallejo witnesses Escobar's transformation from wealthy businessman to the world's seventh richest man and most wanted criminal. She experiences both the extravagant luxury of his lifestyle - private jets, mansions, unlimited wealth - and the terrifying violence that sustains it. The memoir contains chilling scenes of Escobar's psychological manipulation, including one where he blindfolds her and caresses her neck with a revolver, asking how it feels to be at the mercy of a "serial killer." Vallejo becomes increasingly aware of the political corruption, assassinations, and terror that fuel Escobar's empire, including the murder of presidential candidate Luis Carlos Galán.

### Part 3: Days of Absence and Silence
After ending their relationship, Vallejo becomes a target. The book culminates with her dramatic escape from Colombia under DEA protection in 2006, carrying evidence that could expose high-level political connections to drug cartels. Her testimony helps convict former presidential candidates and reveals how deeply drug money corrupted Colombia's democratic institutions. The introduction shows her being whisked away by armored vehicles from the American embassy, knowing that if she disappears, the truth about Colombia's most infamous crimes dies with her.
