## Core Insights

### The Foundation: Body Language Evolution
Body language isn't new—it's as ancient as humanity itself, though only seriously studied for the past 60 years. Your body reveals your inner state through constant visual communication, whether you realize it or not. Understanding this gives you power to both read others and control the messages you send.

> "Daily, your body is relaying messages about your thinking, your mood, and your general state of being."
**Quick Take**: Your body never lies—learn to read and control these signals for maximum impact.

### The Psychology of Physiology
Your mental and emotional states follow your physical posture. Adopt confident body language, and you'll temporarily feel confident. This is the scientific basis behind "fake it till you make it"—psychology follows physiology.

> "By performing themed specific actions and gestures you'll produce corresponding mental states i.e. psychology and emotions follow physiology."
**Quick Take**: Change your body position to change your emotional state instantly.

### The Seven Universal Micro-Expressions
These brief (0.04-0.07 seconds) facial expressions reveal true emotions and cannot be faked:
- **Happiness**: Lip corners up, cheeks raised, crow's feet at eyes
- **Surprise**: Mouth open, eyes wide, eyebrows raised
- **Fear**: Mouth widened, eyebrows raised, eyes widened
- **Sadness**: Lip corners down, eyebrows slanted up at sides
- **Anger**: Lips pressed, eyebrows slanted toward nose, eyes narrowed
- **Disgust**: Upper lip raised, nose wrinkled
- **Contempt**: One side of lip raised, head tilted back

**Quick Take**: Master spotting these micro-expressions to detect true emotions.
