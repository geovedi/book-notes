## Summary
Faster Than Normal reclaims ADHD as a competitive advantage rather than a deficit, arguing that the "faster than normal" brain is actually a gift that can be harnessed for extraordinary productivity and success. Shankman, a successful entrepreneur with ADHD, provides a playbook of practical strategies to transform ADHD traits from obstacles into assets.

This guide is perfect for anyone with ADHD seeking to leverage their unique brain wiring, as well as non-ADHD individuals who want to learn productivity hacks that can give them back 3+ hours per day. The book delivers actionable frameworks for turning hyperactivity, impulsivity, and distraction into powerful tools for innovation and achievement.

## The ADHD Advantage Framework

### Core Principle: ADHD as a Gift
ADHD isn't a disorder—it's a different way of thinking that comes with distinct advantages. The key is learning to operate your "faster than normal" brain at maximum potential rather than trying to conform to neurotypical standards.

> "ADHD is not a negative! Quite the opposite. You're gifted with a brain that's faster than normal, and in this book, we're going to learn how to operate it to its maximum potential."

**Quick Take**: Stop viewing ADHD as something to fix and start seeing it as an advantage to optimize.

### The Four ADHD Undeniable Life Rules

#### Rule 1: Eliminate Choice Whenever Possible
ADHD brains thrive on routine and structure because decision fatigue depletes already limited dopamine reserves. Creating systems that reduce daily choices frees up mental bandwidth for what matters.

**Implementation**:
- Sleep in workout clothes to eliminate morning decisions
- Set out next day's clothes the night before
- Stick to one brand of essential items
- Create rigid morning and evening routines

#### Rule 2: Eat Well
What you eat directly impacts focus and productivity. Processed foods impair cognitive function, while clean eating enhances ADHD advantages like creativity and rapid thinking.

> "Eat crap, look like crap, think like crap. Eat healthy, look healthy, think healthy."

**Quick Win**: Replace one processed snack with real food daily and notice the mental clarity difference within days.

#### Rule 3: Sleep Well
Quality sleep is non-negotiable for ADHD brains. It restores dopamine levels and provides the foundation for focus and creativity the following day.

**Strategy**: Maintain consistent sleep schedules even on weekends, and create a wind-down routine that signals your brain it's time to rest.

#### Rule 4: Exercise, and Do It Outside as Much as Possible
Exercise releases dopamine and endorphins that ADHD brains desperately need. Outdoor activity adds the bonus of nature's calming effects, creating the perfect neurochemical cocktail for focus.

**Implementation**: Aim for 6+ exercise sessions weekly. Even 15-minute walks can reset your brain chemistry significantly.

## Productivity Systems

### Deadline-Driven Life
ADHD brains require hard deadlines to function. Open-ended tasks never get completed because "ASAP" means "never" to the ADHD mind.

> "I have a deadline for everything I do, every single thing I do. My friends, you should, too."

**Framework**:
1. Never accept "when you can" deadlines
2. Work backward from due dates to create action plans
3. Set artificial deadlines if none exist
4. Use the "night-before plan" for critical events

### Environment Optimization
Your physical space directly impacts mental performance. Clutter creates cognitive load that overwhelms ADHD brains.

**Minimalist Approach**:
- Clean workspaces aren't optional—they're essential
- Throw away 90% of desk clutter into a box; discard if unused after one month
- Digitize photos and documents (services like ScanMyPhotos.com)
- Hire cleaning services if possible—it's an investment, not an expense

### Strategic Outsourcing
Delegate anything that prevents forward momentum on high-value activities. This applies to both personal and professional life.

**Examples**:
- Virtual assistants for scheduling and logistics
- Cleaning services for home maintenance
- Laundry services for clothing management
- Travel agents for booking trips (prevents $3,000 mistakes like flying to wrong cities)

## The Neurochemical Advantage

### Dopamine Management
ADHD brains require more dopamine than neurotypical brains to function optimally. The key is finding positive ways to generate it rather than seeking cheap thrills.

**Positive Dopamine Sources**:
- Exercise (especially outdoors)
- Completing tasks and checking them off
- Learning new skills
- Social interaction with engaging people
- Challenging work that pushes your limits

### The Exercise-Sleep-Eat Triangle
These three elements form the foundation of ADHD performance optimization. When one suffers, all three suffer—and so does your productivity.

**Quick Implementation**: Start with just one element. Exercise is often the easiest entry point because it provides immediate dopamine rewards that make the other habits easier to build.

## Questions to Consider

1. What would change if you viewed your ADHD traits as advantages rather than disabilities?
2. Which of the Four Life Rules would create the biggest immediate impact if implemented tomorrow?
3. What's one thing you could outsource this week that would free up 3+ hours of mental energy?
4. How much more productive would you be if you never had to search for lost items again?
5. What if your greatest "weaknesses" are actually your superpowers in the right environment?

## Conclusion
**Faster Than Normal** delivers exactly what its title promises—a practical guide to transforming ADHD from a struggle into a strategic advantage. Shankman's approach works because it's built on acceptance rather than correction, optimization rather than normalization.

The book is worth your time if: you have ADHD and want actionable strategies rather than sympathy, you manage someone with ADHD and need to understand their operating system, or you're simply someone who wants to learn productivity hacks that work for extreme thinkers.

The biggest takeaway? Stop trying to think "normally" and start leveraging your faster-than-normal brain for what it does best: rapid ideation, creative problem-solving, and high-energy execution when properly channeled. This isn't about managing a disorder—it's about optimizing a gift.
