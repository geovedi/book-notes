## Core Insights

### Calculate Your Life Expectancy
The book begins with a comprehensive life expectancy calculator that goes beyond basic statistics. You start with the average lifespan of 81 years and adjust based on multiple factors: sex (women add 2 years, men subtract 2), geographic location, family history, BMI, smoking habits, alcohol consumption, and lifestyle choices. This isn't just morbid curiosity—it's designed to motivate you to take action while you still have time. The calculator provides a personalized wake-up call about how long you might have to get your affairs in order.

> "The days of our lives are threescore years and ten; And if by reason of strength they be fourscore years, Yet is their strength labour and sorrow; For it is soon cut off, and we fly away."

**Quick Take**: Your actual life expectancy could be significantly different from the average, and knowing this helps you prioritize what needs to be done now versus what can wait.

### Your Digital Legacy Matters More Than Ever
In today's connected world, your digital footprint will outlive your physical body. The book provides detailed guidance for managing social media accounts (Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, LinkedIn), email accounts, websites, and apps after death. Each platform has different policies and procedures—some allow memorialization, others require deletion, and some will automatically close accounts after periods of inactivity. Without proper planning, your digital presence could become an embarrassing "zombie account" or disappear entirely, taking precious memories and assets with it.

> "No one is finally dead until the ripples they cause in the world die away."

**Quick Take**: Appoint a "digital executor" and leave detailed instructions for each online account, including passwords and desired actions (memorialize, delete, or maintain).

### Will Writing Doesn't Require Expensive Lawyers
The book demystifies will creation, explaining that you can create a legally valid will yourself without expensive legal fees. It provides clear requirements for different jurisdictions (England/Wales, Scotland, US states) and emphasizes the importance of proper witnessing, storage, and keeping your will updated. The author reveals the will industry's secrets and shows how ready-made templates can be just as effective as expensive solicitor-drafted documents for most people's needs.

> "You know I'm goin' over sixty, I'm older than most. It won't be long now, I'll be nothin' but a ghost."

**Quick Take**: Store your will in multiple locations (physical and digital), tell your executors where to find it, and review it every 3-5 years or after major life events.

### Asset Valuation Goes Beyond Bank Accounts
Most people underestimate their net worth because they forget to include digital assets, personal property, insurance policies, and intellectual property. The book provides comprehensive worksheets for cataloging everything from real estate and investments to social media accounts, domain names, and even loyalty points. It also covers debts and liabilities, giving a complete picture of your actual net worth.

> "Send my belongings to the Lost And Found."

**Quick Take**: Create a detailed inventory spreadsheet including account numbers, passwords, and contact information for every asset and liability.

### Funeral Planning Is a Gift to Your Loved Ones
Making your funeral arrangements in advance isn't about being morbid—it's about kindness. The book covers everything from burial vs. cremation decisions to music selection, officiant choices, and even live-streaming options for distant relatives. By making these decisions yourself, you spare your family from difficult choices during grief and ensure your wishes are honored.

**Quick Take**: Include funeral preferences in your will, leave a separate letter with personal touches, and prepay if possible to lock in costs and reduce burden on family.
