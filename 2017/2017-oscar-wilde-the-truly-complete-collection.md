## Core Insights

### The Aesthetic Philosophy: Art for Art's Sake
Wilde championed the idea that beauty exists for its own sake, independent of moral or practical purpose. His aesthetic movement emphasized that art should be beautiful above all else, rejecting Victorian demands that literature serve educational or moral functions. This philosophy appears throughout his works, from Lord Henry's hedonistic speeches in "Dorian Gray" to the purely entertaining dialogue in his comedies.

> "All art is at once surface and symbol. Those who go beneath the surface do so at their peril."

**Quick Take**: True art needs no justification beyond its beauty—value lies in appreciation, not utility.

### The Comedy of Social Manners
Wilde's plays are masterful satires of Victorian high society, using witty dialogue and absurd situations to expose social hypocrisy. "The Importance of Being Earnest" famously mocks marriage proposals, social status, and the trivial concerns of the upper class through its clever plot about invented identities and the pursuit of the name "Earnest."

> "In matters of grave importance, style, not sincerity, is the vital thing."

**Quick Take**: Social conventions often mask absurdity—laugh at the ridiculous to preserve your sanity.

### The Duality of Human Nature
"The Picture of Dorian Gray" explores the conflict between surface beauty and inner corruption. Dorian remains physically perfect while his portrait ages and reflects his moral decay, symbolizing how society prioritizes external appearance over internal character—a theme still relevant in our image-obsessed culture.

> "The only way to get rid of a temptation is to yield to it."

**Quick Take**: Your inner reality eventually manifests outward—integrity matters more than appearance.

### Paradox as Truth
Wilde revolutionized English literature through his masterful use of paradox, revealing deeper truths through contradictory statements. His paradoxes force readers to question conventional wisdom and see the complexity beneath surface simplicity.

> "Experience is the name everyone gives to their mistakes."

**Quick Take**: Apparent contradictions often contain profound wisdom—embrace complexity over simplicity.

### Individualism vs. Social Conformity
Throughout his works, Wilde champions the individual against oppressive social expectations. His characters struggle between authentic self-expression and the pressure to conform, reflecting Wilde's own experience as a gay man in Victorian England and his belief in living life boldly.

> "Be yourself; everyone else is already taken."

**Quick Take**: Authentic expression requires courage—social approval costs too much of your soul.
