## Core Strategies: A Practical Playbook

### 1. Reveal/Rhema Marketing Style: Problem-First Approach
**The Foundation**: Expose your prospect's problem before presenting your solution. This method creates immediate attention by shining "light on darkness."

**How to Apply**:
- Start by identifying the core problem your target audience faces
- Use pattern: "Are you tired of [problem]? Let me show you [solution]"
- Generalize problems when possible (e.g., "financial mess" instead of listing specific debt types)
- Create urgency by highlighting consequences of inaction

**Example Template**: "I need your attention: if you have suffered from [problem], then you're about to see for yourself [solution]. Skip this and you skip a shockingly simple [benefit]."

> "Almost no one feels comfortable with that but that is one way that is sure going to get you the attention you need."

**Quick Win**: Practice problem-first messaging in your next sales pitch or email campaign.

### 2. Advanced Reveal Marketing: Fact-Based Enhancement
**The Method**: Layer your problem-solution framework with compelling facts and data to establish credibility and educate customers.

**Implementation Steps**:
- Research relevant statistics about the problem you're solving
- Position yourself as a knowledgeable expert who understands the issue deeply
- Use facts to demonstrate the severity of the problem and effectiveness of your solution

**Example**: "Children need physical activity to develop strong physically and socially, but during this time they're prone to accidents that could threaten their social life for years to come. That's why they depend on you to provide [your product]."
