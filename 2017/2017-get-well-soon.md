# Get Well Soon
**Authors**: Jennifer Wright | **Year**: 2017

## Summary
"Get Well Soon" is a darkly humorous yet illuminating tour through history's most devastating plagues and the heroes who fought them. Wright makes the case that studying past outbreaks isn't just morbid curiosity—it's essential preparation for future pandemics. She reveals that during every crisis, some people behave with remarkable courage and compassion while others devolve into superstitious panic and scapegoating.

This book is perfect for history enthusiasts, public health advocates, and anyone who wants to understand how societies crumble or rally during disease outbreaks. Readers will gain perspective on current health crises and discover timeless lessons about human behavior under pressure.

## Core Insights

### Historical Amnesia Makes Us Vulnerable
Wright argues that our modern distance from deadly diseases has created dangerous complacency. We've experienced nearly thirty years without a major plague killing thousands in developed countries, leading us to forget that this luck is historically unprecedented. This forgetfulness makes us more vulnerable to future outbreaks because we repeat the same mistakes—blaming minorities, embracing quack cures, and abandoning rational thought when fear takes hold.

> "Whether a civilization fares well during a crisis has a great deal to do with how the ordinary, nonscientist citizen responds."

**Quick Take**: Pandemic preparedness isn't just for doctors—it depends on how ordinary people behave when crisis strikes.

### Heroes Use Science, Not Superstition
The book's true heroes—from John Snow tracing cholera to Edward Jenner developing vaccines—all share a common trait: they rely on observation, evidence, and rational thinking rather than fear-based superstition. During the 1854 London cholera outbreak, Snow meticulously mapped cases and identified the contaminated Broad Street pump, removing its handle against widespread belief that "bad air" caused disease.

> "In riding his hobby very hard, he has fallen down through a gully-hole and has never since been able to get out again."

**Quick Take**: Scientific breakthroughs often require challenging conventional wisdom, even when everyone thinks you're crazy.

### Compassion Beats Cruelty Every Time
A recurring theme is that societies responding to plagues with compassion fare better than those resorting to persecution. During the Antonine Plague, Marcus Aurelius kept Rome functional by passing sensible laws about burials and court proceedings, while also allowing horrific persecution of Christians. Wright shows that blaming the sick or marginalized never helps—whether it's medieval Europeans burning Jews for "poisoning wells" or modern anti-vaxxers endangering communities.

> "Sick people are not villains. They are unwell. It's impossible to say this enough."

**Quick Take**: How we treat the most vulnerable during health crises reveals our true character.

### Vaccination is Civilization's Greatest Achievement
Wright makes an impassioned case that vaccines represent humanity's greatest triumph over disease. Smallpox alone killed 400,000 Europeans annually until Jenner developed vaccination using cowpox. The book contrasts the horror of diseases like smallpox—which could kill 30-90% of populations—with the miracle of modern prevention, while taking on anti-vaccination myths with historical evidence.

> "Ask the Aztecs and Incas whether or not they would have liked to have vaccines available to them. Oh, wait, you can't, they're dead."

**Quick Take**: Refusing vaccines isn't just a personal choice—it's a rejection of one of civilization's greatest achievements.

### Crises Reveal True Leadership
Throughout history, effective crisis leadership involves clear communication, decisive action, and maintaining social order. Marcus Aurelius kept Rome functioning during the Antonine Plague by managing burials and legal proceedings. Local leaders during cholera outbreaks who quickly implemented Snow's findings saved lives. The book shows that good leaders don't panic, they practical-ly solve problems.

> "The main responsibility of a plague-time ruler is to stop bodies piling up in the streets."

**Quick Take**: Crisis leadership isn't about inspiring speeches—it's about practical problem-solving under pressure.

## Best Quotes
- "What's natural is the microbe. All the rest—health, integrity, purity (if you like)—is a product of the human will, of a vigilance that must never falter."
- "I wish I had the scientific knowledge to talk about how to make vaccines or cures that might eradicate illness, but I don't. This book isn't just for future Nobel Prize winners... Whether plagues are managed quickly doesn't just depend on hardworking doctors and scientists. It depends on people who like to sleep in on weekends and watch movies and eat French fries."
- "When the next outbreak comes—and I lack the optimism to believe it won't—so many of our challenges will remain the same. We will be so much better off if the absolute maximum number of present-day and future people handle the disease with the aplomb of some of the best figures in this book."

## Action Items
- **Stay informed about public health**: Don't wait for a crisis—learn basic epidemiology and understand how diseases spread.
- **Question your instincts**: When afraid, we naturally seek scapegoats and easy answers. Fight this tendency with critical thinking.
- **Support scientific institutions**: Fund and trust public health organizations before you need them.
- **Vaccinate yourself and your children**: Don't opt out of one of civilization's greatest achievements.
- **Prepare, don't panic**: Have practical plans for emergencies rather than stockpiling toilet paper or buying conspiracy theories.

## Questions to Consider
- When the next pandemic comes, will you respond like John Snow (methodical and evidence-based) or like the medieval Europeans (fearful and superstitious)?
- How can we maintain historical memory of plagues without creating unnecessary anxiety?
- What responsibilities do we have to protect vulnerable populations during health crises?
- How do you balance personal freedom with public health requirements?
- If you lived during a plague, would you be someone who helps others or someone who flees?

## Conclusion
"Get Well Soon" is worth your time because it's both entertaining and urgently relevant. Wright's dark humor makes grim history palatable, while her insights about human behavior during crises feel increasingly essential in our pandemic-aware world. The biggest reason to read this book is its core message: how we respond to plagues reveals everything about our values, our priorities, and our capacity for both rationality and irrationality.

In an age where misinformation spreads as fast as any virus, Wright's historical perspective offers a powerful antidote to panic and prejudice. She reminds us that while diseases are terrifying, how we treat each other during outbreaks matters just as much as any medical intervention. As she puts it, "Diseases are at war with all of us. Diseases don't care about any of the labels, so it makes no sense for us to." This book is both a fascinating history and a practical guide to being the kind of person who helps rather than harms during the next inevitable outbreak.
