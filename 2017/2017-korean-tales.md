> "The Koreans are great students of Nature. Nothing seems to escape their attention as they plod through the fields or saunter for pleasure over the green hills."

### The Clever Rabbit: Outsmarting Power Through Intelligence
The most famous tale features a rabbit who outwits the entire fish kingdom when they plot to use his eyes to cure their king's illness. Through quick thinking and clever deception, the rabbit escapes certain death and teaches a lesson about the triumph of wit over brute force.

> "Once released by the turtle to dig for the eyes in the sand, the rabbit shook the water from his coat, and winking at his clumsy betrayer told him to dig for the eyes himself, that he had only one pair, and those he intended to keep."

**Quick Take**: Intelligence and quick thinking can overcome seemingly impossible odds, even when facing powerful adversaries who believe they hold all the advantages.

### The Enchanted Wine-Jug: Loyalty and Betrayal
This lengthy but captivating tale explains the historical enmity between cats and dogs through the story of an old man with a magical wine-jug that produces endless wine. When the magic amber is accidentally lost, his faithful dog and cat embark on a dangerous quest to recover it, but tragedy strikes during their return journey due to the cat's momentary carelessness.

> "The cat shook his sides till his agitation caused the dog to take in great gulps of water in attempting to keep his head up. This but increased the cat's merriment, till he broke out in a laugh as hearty as that of the children, and in doing so dropped the precious gem into the water."

**Quick Take**: Even the strongest bonds of friendship and loyalty can be shattered by a moment of carelessness, leading to lasting enmity and regret.

### Birds as Messengers of Human Emotions
Korean folklore imbues birds with deep emotional significance, turning them into symbols of human experiences and divine messengers. The tragic story of the oriole bird that eternally calls for her lost lover "Kim" demonstrates how nature becomes a vessel for human sorrow and eternal longing.

> "Now, in the language of Korea, 'Kim-pul-lah-go' means 'call Kim' or 'tell Kim to come,' and 'Kim poh go sip so' means 'I want to see Kim.' So, even to this day, the women and children feel sad when they hear these plaintive notes."

**Quick Take**: Korean culture finds profound meaning in natural phenomena, transforming ordinary bird calls into expressions of eternal human emotions and stories.

### Symbolism in Courtship and Marriage
The wild goose plays a central role in Korean wedding ceremonies, representing the ideals of marital fidelity and lifelong commitment. This tradition stems from the observation that geese remain faithful to their mates even after death, returning yearly to mourn their loss.

> "They further pledge each other at this time in these words: 'Black is the hair that now crowns our heads, yet when it has become as white as the fibres of the onion root, we shall still be found faithful to each other.'"

**Quick Take**: Korean marriage traditions emphasize not just the ceremony but the lifelong commitment to fidelity, using natural symbols to reinforce cultural values about loyalty and devotion.

### The Stork: Symbol of Wisdom and Nobility
In Korean culture, the stork represents wisdom, nobility, and divine connection. This majestic bird is engraved in jade and gold and embroidered in silk as the insignia of rank for the nobility, symbolizing the ability to soar above earthly matters and gain higher wisdom.

> "It is the bird that soars above the battle, and calls down success upon the Korean arms. In its majestic flight it is supposed to mount to heaven; hence its wisdom, for it is reputed to be a very wise bird."

**Quick Take**: True wisdom and leadership involve rising above conflicts to gain broader perspectives, connecting earthly actions with higher principles and divine guidance.

## Best Quotes

- "In religious matters the Koreans are peculiar in that they may be said to be without a religion, properly speaking. Prior to the advent of the present dynasty, Buddhism reigned, but for 498 years it has been in such disfavor that no priest dare enter a walled city."

- "The people dress in imported cotton sheetings mostly, padding them well with cotton-wool for winter use, and using the plain bleached white, or dying the cloth a light shade of blue or green."
