# Creating Great Customer Service
**Authors**: Herbert M. Sancianco | **Year**: 2017

## Summary

"Creating Great Customer Service" is a comprehensive practical playbook that addresses the critical gap between Filipino hospitality and actual customer service delivery in business settings. The author observes that while Filipinos are naturally hospitable, only about 30% of companies truly deliver excellent customer service. This book provides a complete framework for transforming customer service from a basic function into a corporate way of life that drives sustainable business success.

The book systematically breaks down customer service into actionable components: understanding its strategic importance, identifying contact points, recognizing causes of poor service, implementing the "customer is king" philosophy, and building comprehensive service programs. It's written for business owners, managers, and customer service professionals who want to create measurable improvements in customer satisfaction and business performance.

## Core Insights

### Customer Service as Corporate Strategy
Customer service isn't just a department—it's a complete business philosophy that must be embedded in corporate culture. The author defines customer service as "a series of behaviors and activities that generate positive responses and build long-term beneficial relationships." When implemented correctly, it provides competitive advantage, supports corporate image, translates values into action, reduces business threats during difficult periods, and creates team spirit within organizations.

> "Customer service is a sensory game played between a product seller or service provider with the customer, old or new. It starts when the first contact takes place between the two parties, and does not end when the customer leaves the premises of the vendor."

**Quick Take**: Customer service must be treated as a strategic investment, not an operational cost. Companies without formal programs lose at least 25% of their potential sales through poor service.

### The 25% Sales Opportunity Loss Factor
Poor customer service creates measurable business losses through customer fallouts and abandoned purchases. The author quantifies this as a 25% sales opportunity loss factor—companies without good customer service programs unknowingly lose this percentage of their real sales potential. Bad service results from ill-trained staff, absence of formal programs, and owners' failure to appreciate service value.

> "A company in my view that does not have a good and active customer service program unknowingly experiences business opportunity loss of at least 25 percent of its real sales potential, which is also known as the sales opportunity loss factor."

**Quick Take**: Every negative customer experience doesn't just lose one sale—it creates exponential damage through word-of-mouth and permanent customer switching to competitors.

### The Customer Contact Points Framework
Customer service spans multiple contact points: telephone interactions, reception areas, security guards, frontline staff, ambiance, and after-sales support. Each point represents an opportunity to either strengthen or damage the customer relationship. Peak business hours are particularly dangerous zones where poor service often occurs due to overwhelmed staff.

Key contact points include:
- Initial phone contact and reception
- Physical environment and ambiance
- Frontline staff interactions
- Service counter efficiency
- After-sales support and follow-through

**Quick Take**: Map every customer touchpoint in your business and ensure consistent excellence across all interactions, not just the sales transaction.

### Going the Extra Mile: 10 Service Excellence Strategies
The book provides 10 specific strategies for creating customer delight through exceeding expectations:

1. **Establish warm customer rapport** – Recognize repeat customers and use their names
2. **Anticipate customer needs** – Ask the right questions about special requirements
3. **No request is too difficult** – Solve problems first, consult policies later
4. **Create urgency** – Remember the clock starts ticking when customers make requests
5. **Show genuine concern** – Use body language reading and active listening
6. **Anticipate and manage problems** – Handle issues like queue jumpers professionally
7. **Improve service continuously** – Make each experience better than the last

9. **Occasional relationship calls** – Maintain contact beyond business needs
10. **Answer phones with pleasant tone** – First impression sets the entire interaction tone

> "Going the extra mile is actually what one does beyond what is expected or least expected from an individual who is serving a customer—those 'little things' or 'little extras.'"
_Original: "The extra mile is actually what one does beyond what is expected or least expected from an individual who is serving a customer—those 'little things' or 'little extras.'"_

**Quick Take**: Customer delight comes from unexpected small gestures that show you value the person beyond the transaction.

### Creating the Sensory Ambiance Experience
Great customer service engages all five senses. The physical environment must support the service promise through comfort, convenience, pleasantness, happiness, safety, and emotional appeal. The author identifies key result areas that should generate positive sensory reactions:

Essential sensory elements:
- **Comfort** – Physical seating and environmental conditions
- **Convenience** – Easy access and minimal friction points
- **Pleasantness** – Visual appeal and positive atmosphere
- **Safety** – Security and wellbeing assurance
- **Royalty treatment** – Making customers feel valued

**Quick Take**: Your physical environment is as important as your staff's service skills—both must work together to create the complete customer experience.

### Building a Sustainable Customer Service Program
The book outlines a comprehensive framework for implementing customer service programs including:

**Organizational Structure**: Create dedicated customer service teams reporting to COO or CMO, with clear accountability and working manuals.

**Working Budget**: Allocate funds for team salaries, capital expenses, and operational costs.

**Implementation Timeline**: Develop specific preparation, execution, and feedback schedules.

**Key Program Components**:
- Customer database development
- Staff training programs
- Service standardization
- Performance measurement systems
- Continuous improvement processes

**Quick Take**: Customer service excellence requires systematic implementation, dedicated resources, and ongoing measurement—not just good intentions.
