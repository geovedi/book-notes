# How to Rebalance Your Portfolio
**Authors**: Mel Clark | **Year**: 2017

## Summary
Portfolio rebalancing is the systematic process of realigning your investment portfolio back to its target asset allocation percentages. When some investments grow faster than others, your portfolio drifts away from its original risk profile. Rebalancing restores your intended balance by selling overperforming assets and buying underperforming ones.

This practical guide demystifies rebalancing for everyday investors, showing how this simple discipline can reduce portfolio volatility, improve long-term returns, and help investors stay disciplined during market turbulence. The book presents rebalancing not as complex trading strategy but as a risk management tool that allows investors to systematically "buy low and sell high" without emotion or guesswork.

Perfect for self-directed investors who want a straightforward approach to portfolio management without becoming full-time traders. You'll learn simple rebalancing methods that can be automated and require just minutes per year to implement.

## Core Insights

### The Foundation: Asset Allocation Portfolios
An Asset Allocation Portfolio consists of predetermined uncorrelated investments in specific proportions. The key is using assets that move independently of each other—when stocks fall, bonds may rise, providing natural diversification. Rebalancing maintains these target percentages over time, preserving your intended risk level regardless of market conditions.

> "An Asset Allocation Portfolio is a grouping of predetermined uncorrelated investments (assets). The relative amounts invested (position sizes) in each asset are also predetermined."

**Quick Take**: Your asset allocation should match your risk tolerance, not market trends. Once established, rebalancing maintains this discipline automatically.

### The Core Purpose: Risk Management
Rebalancing's primary benefit isn't higher returns—it's risk control. By preventing any single asset class from dominating your portfolio, you reduce vulnerability to market crashes. When stocks become 80% of your 60/40 portfolio due to strong performance, you're exposed to catastrophic losses if the market reverses.

A simple example shows the power: In a 50% market crash, an unrebalanced 80/20 portfolio ($8,000 stocks, $2,000 bonds) would drop to $6,000, while a properly rebalanced 60/40 portfolio ($6,000 stocks, $4,000 bonds) would only fall to $7,000.

> "The purpose of rebalancing is to maintain the benefits of your Asset Management Portfolio. Especially reducing volatility and risk of permanent loss to a level you can live with."

**Quick Take**: Rebalancing is your insurance against market crashes—ensuring no single market collapse can devastate your entire portfolio.

### The Psychology: Doing Something Productive
Many investors fail because they can't resist "doing something" during market volatility. Rebalancing channels this impulse into productive action that follows clear rules. Instead of panic selling or greed buying, you execute predetermined trades that sell high and buy low.

This psychological benefit helps investors stay the course during market turmoil. When others are panicking, you have a clear action plan that makes sense regardless of market conditions.

> "When I rebalance an Asset Allocation Portfolio my need TO DO SOMETHING is fulfilled. And I am better able to sit pat on the speculative investments."

**Quick Take**: Use rebalancing to satisfy your urge to act during market volatility—doing something smart is better than doing something stupid.

## Implementation Frameworks

### Annual Rebalancing Method
The simplest approach: review your portfolio once yearly (perhaps on your birthday) and rebalance back to target allocations. This takes approximately 30 minutes annually and works well for most long-term investors. Many brokerage platforms offer automatic annual rebalancing.

**Steps**:
1. Review current portfolio percentages
2. Identify assets above/below target allocations
3. Calculate trades needed to restore targets
4. Execute trades (typically mutual fund exchanges work best)

### New Money Strategy
When adding funds to your portfolio, direct new money to underperforming assets first. If your S&P 500 allocation should be 25% but is currently only 22%, add new funds there until reaching target. This reduces the need for actual selling/trading while maintaining allocation discipline.

### Withdrawal Strategy
When taking distributions in retirement, sell from overperforming assets first. This naturally rebalances your portfolio while generating cash flow for living expenses.
