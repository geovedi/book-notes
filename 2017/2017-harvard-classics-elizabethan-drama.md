# 2017 Harvard Classics: Elizabethan Drama 1
**Authors**: Christopher Marlowe, William Shakespeare | **Year**: 2017

## Summary
This volume contains four of the most powerful tragedies from Elizabethan England's theatrical golden age, showcasing the evolution of English drama through works by Christopher Marlowe and William Shakespeare. The collection features Marlowe's "Edward the Second" and four of Shakespeare's masterpieces—Hamlet, King Lear, Macbeth, and The Tempest—representing the pinnacle of dramatic achievement in the English language.

**For students of literature, theater enthusiasts, and anyone seeking to understand the foundations of Western drama**, this collection offers profound insights into human nature, power, mortality, and the consequences of ambition. These plays demonstrate how Elizabethan drama transformed storytelling through complex character development, poetic language, and universal themes that remain relevant four centuries later.

## Core Insights

### The Nature of Power and Its Consequences
Elizabethan drama fundamentally explores how power corrupts and destroys. In "Edward the Second," we see a king's favoritism for his courtier Gaveston leading to rebellion and murder. Shakespeare's tragedies extend this theme—King Lear abdicates power only to discover its true value through suffering, while Macbeth's ambition drives him to murder and madness. These plays reveal that power is never benign; it either corrupts absolutely or becomes tragically undervalued until lost.

> "Blow, winds, and crack your cheeks! Rage! Blow! You cataracts and hurricanoes, spout till you have drench'd our steeples, drown'd the cocks!"
> _—King Lear, confronting the storm after losing his kingdom_

**Quick Take**: True leadership isn't about holding power but about understanding its responsibilities and limitations.

### The Human Condition: Death, Madness, and Existential Crisis
These plays probe humanity's deepest anxieties about mortality and meaning. Hamlet's famous "To be or not to be" soliloquy captures the universal struggle with existence, questioning whether it's nobler to endure suffering or end it through death. The plays suggest that madness often serves as a vehicle for truth—Lear's madness reveals profound insights about human nature, while Hamlet's "antic disposition" allows him to speak uncomfortable truths.

> "To be, or not to be: that is the question. Whether 'tis nobler in the mind to suffer the slings and arrows of outrageous fortune, or to take arms against a sea of troubles, and by opposing end them."
> _—Hamlet, contemplating existence and suicide_

**Quick Take**: Facing our mortality honestly often leads to our greatest moments of clarity and humanity.

### Betrayal, Justice, and Moral Order
The plays consistently explore themes of betrayal and the search for justice in a seemingly chaotic world. Each protagonist faces betrayal from those closest to them—Lear from his daughters, Hamlet from his uncle and mother, Edward from his nobles, Macbeth ultimately from his own ambition. Yet the plays suggest that while moral order may be disrupted, it eventually reasserts itself, often through tragic means.

> "Something is rotten in the state of Denmark."
> _—Marcellus, describing the corruption that has infected the kingdom_

**Quick Take**: Justice may be delayed or imperfect, but moral truth eventually reveals itself.

### The Illusion of Control vs. Human Frailty
The Tempest, likely Shakespeare's final play, embodies the theme of relinquishing control. Prospero's magical domination of his island gives way to forgiveness and acceptance of human limitation. Throughout these plays, characters who believe they control their destinies—Macbeth with his prophecies, Edward with his royal authority, Lear with his kingdom division—discover the illusion of their power against the forces of fate, nature, and human weakness.

> "We are such stuff as dreams are made on, and our little life is rounded with a sleep."
> _—Prospero, acknowledging the ephemeral nature of human existence_

**Quick Take**: True wisdom comes from accepting what we cannot control rather than fighting against our limitations.
