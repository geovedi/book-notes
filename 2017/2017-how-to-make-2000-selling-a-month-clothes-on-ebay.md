## Core Insights

### 1. Presentation is Everything
Your photos and descriptions are your only sales tools on eBay. Clean, ironed clothes photographed on a mannequin against a simple background sell significantly better than wrinkled items on plastic hangers. Invest in a $20 mannequin - it will pay for itself many times over and dramatically increase your conversion rates.

> "Image is EVERYTHING on eBay as it is your selling point and the KEY to convince buyers to consider your items for purchase."

**Quick Take**: Professional presentation can make the difference between a $25 sale and no sale at all. Smartphones plus editing apps are sufficient - you don't need professional equipment.

### 2. Detailed Descriptions Build Trust
Buyers can't touch or try your items, so your descriptions must compensate. Include exact measurements (bust, waist, hips, length), fabric content, washing instructions, and honest disclosures of any flaws. Measurements are crucial - many buyers won't even inquire about items without them.

> "Your description is your selling point - your marketing placard."

**Quick Take**: Always include brand name, size, color, and material in your title for search visibility. Comprehensive descriptions reduce returns and build buyer confidence.

### 3. Strategic Pricing Matters
Research similar items before pricing. Most sellers use "Buy It Now" pricing (70% of eBay sales) rather than auctions. Price competitively but don't undersell - the eBay market often commands higher prices than local secondhand stores, especially for brands in high demand.

**Quick Take**: Check completed listings to see what similar items actually sold for, not just what's currently listed.

### 4. Customer Service Creates Repeat Business
Fast shipping, polite communication, and generous return policies (30+ days) boost your visibility in eBay's search algorithm. Even though returns seem counterintuitive, they actually increase overall sales by building buyer confidence.

> "Having a fantastic return policy in place does more good for sales than it hurts."

**Quick Take**: Always include tracking numbers and respond promptly to inquiries. Good reviews are your most valuable asset.

### 5. Focus on Low-Return Items
Avoid selling "rental" items like bridal wear, tuxedos, or formal dresses that people typically buy for one-time events. These items have higher return rates as buyers use them and then return them.

**Quick Take**: Stick to everyday clothing items that people will actually wear long-term rather than special occasion pieces.
