## Summary
Dr. Joanie Fisher, an epidemiologist, hits rock bottom when her lab burns down, she loses her job, and her boss/lover Robert ends their relationship simultaneously. Just when things seem hopeless, she inherits her grandfather's mysterious $500 million estate, Wolfsbane Manor, nestled in the remote Arkansas mountains. But the inheritance comes with a deadly surprise: the property is infested with werewolves, and her grandfather's death is connected to a secretive condition called "Chronic Lycanthropy Syndrome."

Thrust into a world where werewolves are real and a sinister conspiracy lurks in the shadows, Joanie must use her scientific expertise to research the physical changes affecting these shape-shifters. As she delves deeper into the mystery, she discovers that shadowy figures will stop at nothing—including murder—to prevent her from developing a cure. With the help of a ruggedly handsome shifter and her grandfather's loyal staff, Joanie races against time to unlock the secrets of the Landover family curse and find a treatment before she becomes the next victim.

Perfect for readers who enjoy urban fantasy with strong female protagonists, medical thriller elements, and the perfect blend of romance and supernatural suspense. This genre mashup delivers page-turning tension while exploring themes of scientific ethics, family legacy, and finding strength in the face of impossible odds.

## Core Insights

### The Scientist vs. The Supernatural
Joanie represents the ultimate clash between scientific rationality and supernatural reality. As an epidemiologist trained in evidence-based research, she's forced to confront phenomena that defy conventional explanation when she encounters werewolves at her inherited estate. Her journey from skepticism to acceptance mirrors the classic "scientist meets supernatural" trope, but with fresh nuance as she applies medical research methods to study lycanthropy as a legitimate syndrome rather than mere folklore.

### Family Secrets as Metaphors for Hidden Selves
The Landover curse that "skips a generation" serves as a powerful metaphor for family secrets and inherited traumas. Joanie's discovery that her grandfather was researching the same condition she now faces creates a compelling parallel between scientific inheritance and genetic legacy. The estate itself, Wolfsbane Manor, becomes a character in its own right—housing both the physical manifestations of the curse and the metaphorical weight of family history that Joanie must confront.

### The Ethics of Scientific Discovery
The novel raises important questions about medical ethics and the responsibility of researchers. Joanie's position—studying a condition that affects real people with real emotions—forces her to balance scientific objectivity with human compassion. The conspiracy elements highlight how scientific breakthroughs can be weaponized by those with malicious intent, making her research not just intellectually important but morally urgent.

## Key Characters

### Dr. Joanie Fisher
A brilliant epidemiologist in her late twenties/early thirties who combines scientific rigor with emotional vulnerability. Recently betrayed by both her career and relationship, she's forced to reinvent herself while confronting supernatural threats. Her medical background gives her unique tools to understand lycanthropy as a physiological condition rather than just a curse.

### The Black Wolf
A mysterious werewolf who serves as both threat and potential ally. His red eyes and intimidating presence create immediate tension, but his transformation hints at deeper complexity. He represents the dangerous allure of the unknown and the thin line between monster and victim.

### The Grandfather (Lawrence Landover)
Though deceased, his presence looms large through his research notes, estate planning, and the mysteries he left behind. As a fellow researcher who studied the same condition, he provides both scientific legacy and emotional connection that drives Joanie's investigation.
