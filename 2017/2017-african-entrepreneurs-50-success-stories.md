**Authors**: Iwa Adetunji | **Year**: 2017

## Summary
"African Entrepreneurs: 50 Success Stories" is a compelling showcase of fifty remarkable African business leaders who have built successful companies across the continent despite significant challenges. The book presents each entrepreneur's journey through a brief profile followed by an in-depth interview, revealing their mindset, strategies, and practical advice for aspiring business owners. From tech startups to fashion brands, from pharmaceutical companies to entertainment platforms, these stories collectively demonstrate that Africa is a continent of creators and producers, not just consumers.

It challenges the narrative of Africa as solely dependent on aid by highlighting successful homegrown businesses that create jobs, drive economic growth, and build global brands from local resources.

## Core Insights

### The Power of Local Solutions to Global Problems
African entrepreneurs are succeeding by leveraging local talents, resources, and cultural insights to create world-class products and services. Bethlehem Tilahun Alemu built soleRebels into the world's fastest-growing footwear brand by fusing Ethiopian artisan heritage with contemporary design, creating over 100,000 jobs while planning to reach $1 billion in revenue. She proves that you don't need to leave your home country to build a global business—local resources and talent can be the foundation for international success.

> "It's a myth that you have to go outside the country of your birth to be successful, and I'm a proof that it is possible for Africans to build a successful global company while using local resources and starting from the scratch."
> _- Bethlehem Tilahun Alemu, Founder of soleRebels_

**Quick Take**: Stop looking elsewhere for opportunities—your local community holds untapped potential for global business success.

### Entrepreneurship as Community Empowerment
The most successful African entrepreneurs view business as a vehicle for community transformation rather than personal wealth accumulation. They create jobs, develop local supply chains, and build sustainable ecosystems that lift entire communities. Jason Njoku transformed Nollywood's $3 billion industry into a global entertainment platform through iROKO, reaching millions worldwide while maintaining operations in Lagos, London, and New York.

> "My success has served as a powerful counter to generations of media that has attempted to show Ethiopians as helpless passive recipients of aid. My story runs directly counter to that narrative, and has in fact flipped the discourse on African development from one of poverty alleviation orchestrated by external actors, to one about prosperity creation driven by local Africans maximising their talents and resources."
> _- Bethlehem Tilahun Alemu_

**Quick Take**: Build businesses that solve real community problems—profit follows purpose.

### The Customer Obsession Principle
Across all fifty profiles, the most successful entrepreneurs share an unwavering focus on customer satisfaction. They personally respond to customer inquiries, continuously gather feedback, and build their businesses around customer needs rather than their own preferences. This customer-centric approach becomes their competitive advantage in markets saturated with mediocre service.

> "Love your customers; passionately; always. Without them you have nothing! Create truly awesome products that your customers will love; deliver these products with equally awesome customer focused service so your customers will love you in return!"
> _- Bethlehem Tilahun Alemu's 6-point plan for success_

**Quick Take**: Your customers are your best marketers—treat them like your most important asset.

### Resilience Through Continuous Innovation
African entrepreneurs operate in challenging environments with infrastructure limitations, regulatory hurdles, and market uncertainties. Rather than being defeated by these obstacles, they develop innovative workarounds that become competitive advantages. Jason Njoku couldn't get sufficient bandwidth in Nigeria to upload movies, so he flew to the UK to upload them there—demonstrating the problem-solving mindset that characterizes successful entrepreneurs.

> "Starting an internet business in Nigeria comes with a very unique set of challenges. In the early days, it was the simple things like internet connections. We couldn't get enough bandwidth to upload the movies so I had to jump on a plane back to the UK with a bunch of films and upload them there."
> _- Jason Njoku, CEO of iROKO_

**Quick Take**: Constraints breed creativity—turn obstacles into innovations.

### The Prosperity Creation Mindset
Successful African entrepreneurs reject the "poverty alleviation" narrative in favor of "prosperity creation." They understand that sustainable change comes from building successful businesses that generate wealth, create jobs, and develop local capacity rather than depending on external aid. This mindset shift from recipient to creator is fundamental to entrepreneurial success.

> "Layered on top of this was that I kept hearing over and over the phrase 'poverty alleviation' in the wider context of Ethiopia and specifically with regards to the community where I grew up. As I entered college and started working to support myself and my brothers, it had become clear to me that Poverty alleviation is a myth. It became clear to me that prosperity creation is the sole route to the elimination of poverty."

**Quick Take**: Stop waiting for handouts—start creating value that generates sustainable prosperity.
