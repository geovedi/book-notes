# The Master: How to Practice The Science of Decision Making with Confidence and Know What You Really Want
**Authors**: Robin Sacredfire | **Year**: 2017

## Summary
This philosophical guide explores the intersection of decision-making, spiritual growth, and personal mastery. The book presents a radical approach to understanding how our mental patterns, beliefs, and emotional responses shape our reality and limit our potential for true wisdom. Sacredfire argues that most people remain mentally imprisoned by preconceived notions rather than genuinely ignorant, preventing them from accessing deeper truths about themselves and their purpose.

The book challenges readers to distinguish between following a path versus understanding their true purpose, emphasizing that many achieve success only to discover it wasn't what they truly wanted. It presents spirituality as a practical science for mastering one's destiny through conscious observation, emotional regulation, and the deliberate application of creative willpower.

**Who benefits**: Spiritual seekers, decision-makers, and anyone feeling stuck in patterns of achievement without fulfillment. Readers will gain frameworks for breaking free from social conditioning, understanding the mechanics of spiritual willpower, and learning how to manifest their true desires through conscious choice rather than reactive living.

## Core Insights

### The Illusion of Path vs. Purpose
Many adults become mesmerized by activities rather than their end goals, unlike children who naturally focus on desired outcomes. We often claim being "too busy" without questioning what we're busy accomplishing, leading to a herd mentality where we follow rather than lead. True leadership requires mastering the art of observation and recognizing when we're choosing activities that serve no logical purpose.

> "Adults are actually much more susceptible to magic than children. And this, because children fundamentally observe but adults are determined by their own mental patterns"

**Quick Take**: Regularly ask yourself if your current activities are serving your true purpose or just keeping you busy. Children naturally focus on rewards; adults get lost in the process.

### The Ego's Role in Blocking Wisdom
The more someone believes they're correct, the more resistant they become to truth that challenges their position. This creates the paradox where arrogant people appear confident but are actually the most ignorant, while wise individuals often seem humble and are perceived as foolish by those trapped in ego-driven certainty.

> "The complexity perceived in the difficulty to apprehend reality, is not more than another way to notice the infinite, when we're not addressing the finite with our thoughts"

**Quick Take**: True wisdom begins with acknowledging what you don't know. Practice humility by actively seeking perspectives that challenge your current beliefs.

### Success vs. True Fulfillment
Many people spend their lives achieving goals only to realize those weren't their true desires. The book defines this as the ultimate failure - succeeding at something you hate or maintaining commitments that make you miserable. Real success requires honestly questioning whether your goals align with your authentic self before investing years in pursuit.

> "You are unsuccessful if you succeed at competing in the same career for all your life while hating it, you are unsuccessful if you hate your partner but succeed in maintaining the marriage"

**Quick Take**: Before pursuing any goal, ask yourself: "Is this truly what I want, or what I think I should want?" Success without fulfillment is the ultimate failure.

### Spiritual Willpower and Reality Creation
Our emotions and focused attention actively shape our reality. Whatever we focus on with strong emotion - positive or negative - manifests more evidence of that emotion in our lives. This creates a feedback loop where our beliefs literally create the experiences that justify those beliefs. By consciously choosing to focus on joy, gratitude, and helping others, we attract more reasons to experience those states.

> "The strength of the difficulties and barriers we face when trying to push ourselves to change are many times rooted in trauma, either from childhood or past lives"

**Quick Take**: Your emotional focus is your reality-creation tool. Practice deliberately choosing feelings that align with your desired outcomes rather than reacting to circumstances.

### The Farming Metaphor for Spiritual Growth
Sacredfire uses agriculture to illustrate divine principles: seeds represent our environment choices, fertilization symbolizes daily learning, roots show our foundation strength, and balance between sun and shadow reflects the need to harmonize work, joy, and relationships. Like farming, spiritual growth requires patience, proper conditions, and consistent nurturing.

> "There is no higher truth than love"

**Quick Take**: Approach your growth like farming - plant yourself in fertile environments, fertilize with daily learning, build strong roots, and balance different aspects of life.

## Best Quotes
- "Thinking is both a science and an art. Without the right tools, methods and the proper understanding of the mechanics behind the process of thinking, one cannot allow his spirit to evolve and find truth."
- "Enlightenment is not for the cowards or naive, and never was. It is a path for the brave."
- "We are so focused on the end goal, on the achievement, on our own evaluation of our success, that we neglect the fact that success is indeed and very commonly a lack of it."
- "When you're happy, you want to do more, help more people, and basically share your happiness. And that's why happiness will always be related to more conscience."
- "True spirituality is indeed power in application. One gets in the proportion of what he gives back, and his responsibility increases in correlation to the skills he is entitled to develop by virtue."

## Action Items
- **Practice Daily Observation**: Set aside time each day to observe situations without judgment, like a child would, rather than filtering through your preconceived mental patterns
- **Question Your "Busy"**: Before saying you're too busy for something, examine whether your current activities actually serve your true purpose
- **Embrace Productive Failure**: Recognize when achieving something isn't bringing fulfillment, and have the courage to pivot rather than persisting out of ego
- **Choose Your Emotional Focus**: Deliberately focus on positive emotions and helping others, knowing this creates reality-shifting feedback loops
- **Seek Truth Over Agreement**: Be willing to stand alone with truth rather than compromising for social acceptance

## Questions to Consider
- What have I achieved that looked like success but left me feeling empty?
- Where am I following a path instead of pursuing my true purpose?
- What beliefs am I defending that might be blocking greater wisdom?
- How would my life change if I focused on observation rather than judgment?
- What would I attempt if I weren't afraid of losing my current reality?

## Conclusion
This book offers a radical reframe of decision-making as a spiritual science rather than a logical process. While some concepts like past-life trauma may challenge skeptical readers, the core insights about ego, observation, and emotional focus provide valuable frameworks for anyone feeling trapped in patterns of achievement without fulfillment.

The biggest reason to read this book is its uncompromising stance on authentic living versus social conditioning. Sacredfire pushes readers to examine whether their successes represent true alignment with their deeper purpose or sophisticated forms of self-betrayal. For decision-makers tired of analytical frameworks that ignore emotional and spiritual dimensions, this book offers a refreshing alternative that treats wisdom as both observable science and sacred art.

At 5-10 minutes reading time, this guide captures the essence of a book that could transform your relationship with success, failure, and the very nature of conscious choice. The practical value lies not in its metaphysical claims but in its ruthless examination of why we make the choices we do - and how we might choose differently if we dare to see beyond our current reality.
