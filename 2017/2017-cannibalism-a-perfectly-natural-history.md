# Cannibalism: A Perfectly Natural History
**Author**: Bill Schutt | **Year**: 2017

## Summary
"Cannibalism: A Perfectly Natural History" is a fascinating scientific exploration that challenges our deepest taboos by examining cannibalism from a biological and anthropological perspective. Zoologist Bill Schutt reveals that far from being rare or aberrant, cannibalism is a widespread and evolutionarily successful strategy found throughout the natural kingdom—from insects and amphibians to mammals and potentially even humans.

The book systematically dismantles our cultural assumptions about cannibalism by presenting compelling evidence that this behavior serves important ecological and evolutionary functions. Schutt's approach is rigorously scientific yet accessible, combining field research, laboratory studies, and historical accounts to show how cannibalism functions as a survival strategy, population control mechanism, and even developmental trigger across species.

For anyone interested in biology, evolution, or understanding the gap between cultural taboos and natural reality, this book offers a mind-expanding perspective that will forever change how you view the natural world and human behavior within it.

## Core Insights

### Cannibalism is Evolutionarily Normal, Not Aberrant
Schutt demonstrates that cannibalism is far from rare in nature—it's a well-documented behavior across every major animal group. The scientific community once dismissed cannibalism as captivity-induced or starvation-driven, but pioneering researchers like Laurel Fox and Gary Polis revealed it's actually a common, adaptive response to environmental pressures. From backswimmer insects to tiger salamanders, cannibalism serves crucial functions like accelerated growth, population control, and resource optimization. The book shows that what we consider a horrifying taboo is often just business as usual in the natural world.

### Environmental Triggers Create Cannibal Morphs
One of the book's most striking revelations is how some species can physically transform into cannibalistic forms in response to environmental pressures. Schutt's firsthand observations of spadefoot toad tadpoles reveal how some individuals dramatically develop larger bodies, powerful jaws, and serrated teeth when ponds are drying up. These cannibal morphs can reach maturity in 20 days instead of 30, escaping before their habitat disappears. Similarly, tiger salamanders develop cannibalistic traits when crowded. This phenotypic plasticity shows cannibalism isn't just a fallback strategy—it's an evolved solution that can be triggered when needed.

> "These look like two different species," I said, examining a handful of tadpoles that I'd just scooped up. The larger tadpoles were sporting powerful tails and serious-looking beaks made of keratin.

**Quick Take**: Nature can literally reshape organisms into cannibals when environmental conditions demand it.

### The Colonial Cannibal Myth
Schutt meticulously documents how European colonizers used accusations of cannibalism to justify conquest, enslavement, and genocide of indigenous peoples. Columbus's labeling of Caribbean peoples as "cannibals" provided religious and legal cover for their brutal exploitation. The book reveals how explorers routinely fabricated or exaggerated accounts of cannibalism, creating a pattern where accusations served colonial interests rather than reflecting reality. This historical analysis shows how the taboo around cannibalism has been weaponized throughout history to dehumanize "others."

### Disease Risks Shape Cannibalistic Behavior
The book provides crucial insights into why cannibalism remains relatively rare despite its benefits: disease transmission. Cannibals risk acquiring species-specific parasites and pathogens from their victims. The most compelling example is the kuru epidemic among Papua New Guinea's Fore people, whose ritual endocannibalism nearly drove them to extinction. This devastating prion disease, similar to mad cow disease, demonstrates how natural selection has favored cannibalism avoidance in many species due to the health risks.

### Kin Recognition Evolves to Prevent Inbreeding
Remarkably, many cannibalistic species have evolved mechanisms to avoid eating relatives. Through the "armpit effect"—recognizing kin by scent—or other cues, animals like paper wasps and tiger salamanders preferentially target non-kin. This preserves inclusive fitness, ensuring cannibals don't eliminate their own genes from the gene pool. However, under starvation conditions, even these kin-avoidance mechanisms break down, showing that survival ultimately overrides family ties.

## Best Quotes
- "I've tried to approach each example from a scientific viewpoint, delving into what I considered the most intriguing aspects of anthropology, evolution, and biology to provide the broadest yet most engaging natural history of this behavior."
- "Fox determined that, while the voracious hunters relied primarily on aquatic prey, 'cannibalism was also a consistent part of their diets.'"
- "Like other taboos, the revulsion that most people feel about cannibalism is a product of culture, not biology."
- "Just because we consider cannibalism an ultimate taboo, why should the members of other cultural groups necessarily feel the same way?"

## Action Items
- **Question Your Taboos**: Recognize that many of our strongest aversions are culturally constructed rather than biologically necessary
- **Think Evolutionarily**: When observing animal behavior, consider what survival advantage it might provide rather than judging it by human standards
- **Examine Historical Claims**: Look critically at historical accounts, especially those used to justify power dynamics or colonialism
- **Study Natural Systems**: Understanding how cannibalism functions in nature can reveal broader principles about adaptation and survival

## Questions to Consider
- How many other behaviors we consider "unnatural" might actually be common in the natural world?
- What other cultural taboos might have evolved from practical concerns about disease or survival?
- How do modern conservation efforts affect natural cannibalistic behaviors that may be crucial for ecosystem health?
- If humans discovered that cannibalism had health benefits, could cultural taboos ever be overcome?

## Conclusion
"Cannibalism: A Perfectly Natural History" is worth your time because it challenges fundamental assumptions about nature and culture while revealing the complex biological realities behind one of humanity's strongest taboos. Schutt's masterful storytelling combines scientific rigor with accessible explanations, making complex biological concepts fascinating and understandable. The book's greatest value lies in showing how evolution often produces solutions that seem horrific to our cultural sensibilities but make perfect biological sense. By understanding cannibalism as a natural strategy rather than an aberration, readers gain a deeper appreciation for evolution's creativity and the thin line between biological reality and cultural construction. This isn't just a book about cannibalism—it's about how nature solves problems and how human culture sometimes conflicts with biological reality.
