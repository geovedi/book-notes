## Summary
Jenny Ackerly is a school teacher who refuses to give up searching for her best friend Carly, who disappeared two years ago. During one of her searches along the Oregon coast, Jenny spots a young boy running into the freezing ocean. When the child doesn't resurface, Jenny's protective instincts take over and she dives in to save him, swimming deeper and farther than ever before until she's caught in a powerful undertow. When she resurfaces, she finds herself in a magical underwater world.

Orion is the powerful King of the Sea People, ruler of the Isle of the Sea Serpent. His world is in crisis—the mystical Eyes of the Sea Serpent have been stolen, and his oldest son has made a dangerous bargain with the Sea Witch that threatens to destroy the merpeople and possibly all of the Seven Kingdoms. When Jenny appears in his realm, she becomes his unexpected ally in a desperate fight against ancient evil.

**Perfect for readers who enjoy**: Fantasy romance with strong heroines, underwater kingdoms, political intrigue, and the classic "human falls for supernatural ruler" trope with added depth from the single-parent dynamic and cross-world adventure.

## Core Insights

### The Power of Unbreakable Bonds
Jenny's loyalty to Carly drives the entire plot, showing how love and friendship can transcend even the boundaries between worlds. Her refusal to accept that her friend is gone leads her to discover a reality she never imagined existed. This demonstrates that true friendship isn't about giving up when things seem hopeless—it's about continuing to search, believe, and fight for those we care about, even when all evidence suggests we should move on.

> "I swear, when I find out what happened to you, Carly, I'm going to toast their ass. I'll rip them apart, put them back together, ask them how it feels, and do it all over again."

**Quick Take**: Sometimes our greatest adventures begin when we refuse to let go of the people who matter most to us.

### Finding Family in Unexpected Places
Orion is a grieving widower raising two young sons alone while struggling to rule his underwater kingdom. The introduction of Jenny into their lives creates an unlikely family unit that transcends species and worlds. The story explores how families aren't always born—they're sometimes forged through circumstance, mutual protection, and the willingness to open your heart to new possibilities when you least expect it.

> "This…, she thought, is someone I could wake up next to for the rest of my life."

**Quick Take**: True family isn't defined by blood or species, but by the connections we build through love, trust, and mutual support.

### Courage Beyond Comfort Zones
Jenny, a regular human woman, must adapt to an underwater world completely alien to her own. Her journey from ordinary school teacher to heroine in a magical realm shows that courage isn't the absence of fear—it's acting despite fear when something important is at stake. Her character demonstrates that ordinary people can do extraordinary things when motivated by love and the desire to protect others.

> "What in the hell am I doing? This is totally crazy! she thought as a wave of panic swept through her."

**Quick Take**: The most heroic acts often come from ordinary people facing extraordinary circumstances and choosing to help others despite their own fear.
