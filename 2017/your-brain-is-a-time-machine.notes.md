### 1:00 Flavors of Time
- Introduction: The Complexity of Time
  - Time is a fundamental concept in human life, with its significance highlighted by the fact that even those who possess nothing else still possess time.
  - The importance of time is reflected in common phrases and expressions related to it, such as saving time, killing time, tracking time, etc.
  - Various fields of study, including philosophy, physics, neuroscience, and psychology, grapple with understanding time and its different dimensions.
- The Mystery of Time: Definitions and Philosophical Questions
  - The word "time" stands atop the list of the most commonly used nouns in English, yet there's no consensus on its definition.
  - The challenge of defining time was acknowledged by Saint Augustine, indicating the perplexing nature of the concept.
  - Philosophical questions about time include its nature, whether it's a dimension, and its relation to free will.
  - The goal is to explore and answer these questions, though the nature of the human brain poses limitations.
- Exploring Time's Complexity: Time vs. Space
  - Time is more intricate and harder for the human brain to comprehend than space.
  - Vertebrate animals can navigate and create internal maps of space, but understanding time is not as crucial due to its lack of physical navigability.
  - Unlike space, animals cannot physically navigate through time, which contributes to the lack of emphasis on understanding time.
- Evolution of Science and Time: Geometry and Dynamics
  - Geometry was the first formalized scientific field, neglecting time.
  - Euclidean geometry focused on space, and only much later did scientists begin incorporating time into mathematics and physics.
  - Galileo's observations of a swaying lamp led to dynamics, and Newton's calculus enabled describing changes over time.
- Advances in Physics: Chaos and Relativity
  - Scientists realized that even within Newton's laws, predicting future outcomes is not always feasible due to chaos.
  - Einstein's theories, including special and general relativity, reshaped our understanding of time as a dimension.
  - The clash between the subjective perception of time's flow and physics' block universe concept is a significant challenge.
- Different Facets of Time: Natural Time, Clock Time, and Subjective Time
  - Natural time refers to the concept of time as a dimension and is central to the presentism-versus-eternalism debate.
  - Clock time is defined by clocks and governs daily life, but it's a local measure of change, not absolute or universal.
  - Subjective time is the conscious sense of the passage of time and is a construct created by the brain.
- The Brain's Role in Understanding Time
  - The brain's ability to understand time is constrained by its evolutionary design, and intuitions about time reveal insights into brain architecture.
  - Despite the complexity, fields like neuroscience and psychology are increasingly recognizing the importance of time.
  - The brain is a "time machine," capable of predicting the future, representing time, and projecting into the future.
- Concluding Thoughts: The Mystery Persists
  - Human abilities to predict and project into the future define our species, but they also remind us of the finite nature of our own time.
  - The quest to understand time remains, prompting the question: What is time? The mystery persists.

### 3:00 Day and Night
- Circadian Clock Overview
  - The circadian clock is a biological timekeeping mechanism found in various organisms.
  - Its primary purpose is to anticipate daily changes in the environment, such as light, temperature, and food availability.
  - The basic idea of the circadian clock is similar to regulating the flow of water in a toilet.
- Mechanism of Circadian Clock
  - The circadian clock operates through a transcription/translation autoregulatory feedback loop.
  - Genes in DNA are transcribed into RNA, which is then translated into proteins.
  - Proteins, including Period, inhibit the transcription of the genes that produced them, creating a feedback loop.
  - The concentration of Period protein rises and falls, leading to cyclical regulation.
- Suprachiasmatic Nucleus and Entrainment
  - The suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) is a critical part of the circadian clock located in the brain.
  - It receives input from external cues (zeitgebers) like sunlight to entrain the internal clock with the external environment.
  - SCN activity influences neural signals that determine wakefulness or sleepiness.
- Jet Lag and Entrainment Challenges
  - Travel across time zones disrupts circadian rhythms, causing jet lag.
  - Eastward travel is harder to adjust to than westward travel due to the need for phase advance.
  - The difficulty of resetting the circadian clock after travel reflects its inherent differences from man-made clocks.
- Individual Chronotypes and Sleep Disorders
  - Different chronotypes (morning larks and night owls) exist based on when individuals prefer to sleep and feel alert.
  - Genetic mutations can lead to extreme chronotypes, such as familial advanced sleep-phase disorder.
  - Shift work disrupts natural circadian rhythms and can lead to health issues.
- Circadian Clock's Impact on Physiology
  - Circadian clocks influence various physiological functions, including insulin levels and metabolism.
  - Coordination between circadian clocks within the body is crucial for healthy functioning.
  - Animals with circadian clock mutations or disruptions may experience negative consequences.
- Multiple Clocks for Different Time Scales
  - Circadian clocks are specialized for tracking longer time intervals (hours to a day).
  - Separate mechanisms track shorter intervals (seconds to minutes) and longer infradian rhythms (months).
  - Different animals synchronize behaviors and reproduction with lunar cycles.
- Subjective Perception of Time
  - The circadian clock doesn't provide a direct sense of time passage like a man-made clock.
  - The brain has other means to judge the subjective passage of time.
  - These mechanisms generate the perception of time beyond passive measurement.

### 4:00 The Sixth Sense
- Perception of Time in Life-Threatening Situations:
  - The slow-motion effect, where people perceive time as passing more slowly during high-adrenaline moments, has been widely reported.
  - This phenomenon challenges our understanding of time perception and raises questions about the brain's functioning during intense situations.
- Explanatory Hypotheses:
  - Overclocking Hypothesis:
    - The slow-motion effect might be explained by the brain entering an "overclocked" mode during life-threatening events, allowing quicker reactions and perceptions.
    - Factors affecting task execution time include electrical signal speed, synaptic delays, and neuronal firing time.
  - Hypermemory Hypothesis:
    - Another explanation suggests that the slow-motion effect is an after-the-fact illusion, where events seem to unfold in slow motion during recollection.
    - Neuromodulators released during emotional events can enhance memory, contributing to the perception of slow motion.
  - Metaillusion Hypothesis:
    - Our conscious experiences, including perceptions of time, are essentially illusions generated by the brain.
    - Body awareness and phantom limb syndrome illustrate the illusory nature of subjective experiences.
- Compressing Time in the Brain:
  - The brain's ability to replay events at different speeds is demonstrated by experiments with place cells in rats.
  - Neural trajectories associated with experiences can be replayed in compressed form during rest or sleep.
  - This feature of brain function suggests that the brain can process temporal patterns at different speeds.
- The Nature of Time Perception:
  - Our sense of time is not a true sensory system like vision or hearing, but the brain does measure and sense the passage of time.
  - Temporal illusions reveal the brain's susceptibility to context, learning, attention, and drugs, providing insights into its functioning.
  - All subjective experiences are essentially illusions, which raises the fundamental question of how the brain generates conscious awareness of time and other aspects of reality.
