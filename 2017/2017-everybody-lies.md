# Everybody Lies
**Author**: Seth Stephens-Davidowitz | **Year**: 2017

## Summary
"Everybody Lies" explores how big data, particularly internet search data, reveals our hidden true selves. Stephens-Davidowitz, a former Google data scientist, demonstrates that people's anonymous search queries provide unprecedented insights into human behavior, exposing truths that people would never admit in surveys or conversations. The book argues that while we may lie to others, ourselves, and researchers, our search data tells the truth about our deepest desires, fears, and prejudices—offering a revolutionary new window into human nature.

This book is perfect for data enthusiasts, social scientists, marketers, and anyone curious about human behavior. Readers will gain powerful insights into how big data can reveal hidden truths about society, challenge conventional wisdom, and transform our understanding of everything from politics and relationships to health and sexuality.

## Core Insights

### The Digital Truth Serum
Internet search data acts as a "digital truth serum" because people confess things to Google they wouldn't admit to anyone else. When people search anonymously, they reveal their true thoughts about sensitive topics like racism, sexuality, health concerns, and relationship problems. This data provides unprecedented access to the human psyche, free from social desirability bias that plagues traditional surveys. Google searches for "nigger jokes" or concerns about "sexless marriage" reveal societal truths hidden from public view.

> "The power in Google data is that people tell the giant search engine things they might not tell anyone else."

**Quick Take**: Anonymous search data provides the most honest window into human behavior ever collected.

### The Hidden Map of American Racism
Traditional surveys suggested America had become "post-racial" after Obama's election, but Google searches revealed a different reality. Racist searches were as common as searches for "migraine" and occurred nationwide—not just in the South or among Republicans. On Obama's election night, 1 in 100 Obama-related searches included "kkk" or "nigger(s)." This hidden racism map perfectly predicted Trump's support in areas where polls failed, demonstrating how big data can reveal social forces hidden from traditional measurement.

> "There were millions of these searches every year. A large number of Americans were, in the privacy of their own homes, making shockingly racist inquiries."

**Quick Take**: Big data revealed the true extent and geography of American racism, predicting political outcomes that polls missed.

### The Counterintuitive Nature of Human Behavior
Big data consistently reveals that our intuitions about human behavior are wrong. For example, men from middle-class families are twice as likely to make the NBA as those from poor backgrounds, contrary to the "rags-to-sports-riches" narrative. Similarly, people search for jokes when they're happy (not sad as coping mechanism), and terrorism attacks don't increase anxiety searches. These counterintuitive findings demonstrate how data can overturn our deeply held but mistaken beliefs about human nature.

**Quick Take**: Our intuitions about human behavior are frequently wrong—data reveals the opposite of what we expect.

### The Power of New Data Sources
Revolutionary insights come from finding the right new data sources, not necessarily bigger datasets. Jeff Seder transformed horse racing by measuring horses' left ventricles with portable ultrasound, predicting American Pharoah's Triple Crown victory when traditional experts missed it. Similarly, Orley Ashenfelter predicted wine quality using simple weather data. The lesson: focus on finding the right data that others aren't looking at, not just accumulating more of the same data.

**Quick Take**: The most valuable insights come from creative new data sources, not just bigger datasets.

### The Limitations of Traditional Data
Traditional surveys and studies suffer from systematic biases: people lie about sex (exaggerating frequency), racism (underreporting prejudice), and happiness (downplaying loneliness). married men claim to have sex weekly, while Google shows "sexless marriage" is the top marriage complaint. These limitations make traditional data unreliable for understanding true human behavior, creating opportunities for big data to provide more accurate insights.

**Quick Take**: Traditional data sources are fundamentally compromised by human dishonesty and social desirability bias.

## Best Quotes
- "People lie to friends, lovers, doctors, surveys, and themselves. But on Google they might share embarrassing information."
- "The everyday act of typing a word or phrase into a compact, rectangular white box leaves a small trace of truth that, when multiplied by millions, eventually reveals profound realities."
- "I am now convinced that Google searches are the most important dataset ever collected on the human psyche."
- "Data science takes a natural and intuitive human process—spotting patterns and making sense of them—and injects it with steroids."
- "The methodology of the best data science is frequently natural and intuitive, the results are frequently counterintuitive."

## Action Items
- Look for opportunities to use anonymous or behavioral data rather than self-reported data in your work
- Question conventional wisdom about human behavior—seek data to verify or challenge assumptions
- When seeking insights, focus on finding creative new data sources rather than just accumulating more data
- Remember that correlation doesn't require causation for practical prediction (Walmart stocks strawberry Pop-Tarts before hurricanes)
- Consider that what people say they want often differs from what their behavior reveals they actually want

## Questions to Consider
- What hidden truths might your organization's search data or behavioral patterns reveal?
- How might your personal intuitions about human behavior be wrong?
- What areas of your life or work could benefit from more honest data about what people actually think and do?
- How can we balance the power of big data insights with privacy concerns?
- What social problems might be solved by understanding what people won't admit publicly?

## Conclusion
"Everybody Lies" is essential reading for understanding the data revolution that's transforming our knowledge of human behavior. Stephens-Davidowitz makes a compelling case that internet search data provides the most honest window into human nature ever available—revealing uncomfortable truths about racism, sexuality, and human desires that traditional methods miss.

The biggest reason to read this book is its power to transform how you think about human behavior and knowledge itself. After reading it, you'll understand that many of our assumptions about society are wrong, and that the truth is often hiding in plain sight within the data we generate every day. It's a fascinating, sometimes uncomfortable, but ultimately illuminating journey into what our search patterns reveal about who we really are.

The book's value extends beyond its specific findings—it teaches a new way of thinking about truth and knowledge in the digital age. In an era of "fake news" and competing narratives, Stephens-Davidowitz offers a method for finding objective truth about human behavior, making this not just an interesting read but an essential toolkit for navigating modern life.
