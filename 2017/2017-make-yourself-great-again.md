# Make Yourself Great Again
**Original Title**: Make Yourself Great Again: The Complete Series
**Author**: Dr. Robert C. Worstell | **Year**: 2017

## Summary
"Make Yourself Great Again" is a comprehensive collection that challenges the modern belief that environment determines individual success. Dr. Worstell presents a radical premise: everything needed for success is already programmed within you from birth. The book dismantles commonly accepted "truths" about how the world works - from scientific authority to government reliability to media accuracy - arguing that these external beliefs systematically disconnect us from our innate power.

The collection spans multiple works, including the core "Make Yourself Great Again," "Why You Got All That Stuff," "Choose. Believe. Win.," and "The Art of Wonk." Each builds upon the central thesis that "We become what we think about," presenting practical techniques for reclaiming personal power and deliberately designing your reality through focused thought and belief systems.

This guide is perfect for entrepreneurs, self-help enthusiasts, and anyone feeling trapped by circumstances or conventional wisdom. Readers will learn to dismantle limiting beliefs, harness the power of subconscious mind programming, and implement simple but profound techniques like the "Count to Four" method for systematic achievement.

## Core Insights

### The Great Deception: Environment vs. Individual Power
The book's opening reveals the most damaging lie of modern society: that your circumstances determine your success. Worstell traces this belief system to post-WWII thinking, contrasting it with centuries-old wisdom and remarkable examples of individuals who rose from slavery (George Washington Carver), poverty (most U.S. Presidents and Forbes billionaires), and disadvantage to create extraordinary success. The fundamental truth is that you create your world through your thoughts, not the other way around.

**Quick Take**: Your current reality is the physical manifestation of your consistent thoughts and beliefs.

### Mindset Stacking™: Building Resilient Success Systems
Worstell introduces his trademarked concept of "Mindset Stacking" - the practice of layering proven success principles and techniques to create bomb-proof belief systems. Rather than relying on single approaches, this method combines multiple philosophies and practices, from Earl Nightingale's "Strangest Secret" to Napoleon Hill's "Think and Grow Rich," creating redundancy and reinforcement that makes your success mindset nearly unbreakable.

**Quick Take**: Stack multiple success principles together like reinforcing layers in a fortress.

### The Four-Phase Achievement System
The collection includes James Buchanan Jones' revolutionary "Count to Four" technique, a deceptively simple method for achieving any desire:

1. **Phase One**: Clearly identify and define exactly what you want with crystal clarity
2. **Phase Two**: "Pretend" you already have it - assume the emotional state of your fulfilled desire
3. **Phase Three**: Develop the ability to say "No" to anything that contradicts your vision
4. **Phase Four**: Trust your subconscious mind to handle the "how" while you focus on maintaining the first three phases

This system works because it directly programs your subconscious mind, which Worstell explains operates like fertile soil - whatever seeds (thoughts) you plant will inevitably grow.

**Quick Take**: Your subconscious mind is the magic ingredient - plant clear desires and let nature handle the multiplication.

### The T.N.T. Method: Thoughts That Transform
Claude Bristol's contribution, "T.N.T. - It Rocks The Earth," reveals that thought repetition combined with emotional intensity creates explosive life changes. The science of suggestion demonstrates that constant, creative thoughts lead to corresponding actions, while depressed thoughts create downward spirals. By deliberately directing your thought patterns and emotional states, you can "tap" yourself upward or downward at will.

**Quick Take**: Consistent thought patterns are like dynamite - small but powerful when properly directed.

### The Hero's Journey vs. Winner's Circles
Worstell makes a crucial distinction between the traditional "Hero's Journey" (individual struggle and isolation) and "Winner's Circles" (collaborative success through shared wisdom and support). While the Hero's Journey emphasizes solitary trials, Winner's Circles recognize that sustained success comes from surrounding yourself with other successful people and learning from their experiences. This explains why truly exceptional individuals often belong to multiple mastermind groups and networks.

**Quick Take**: Success is not a solo sport - the winners circle accelerates your growth exponentially.

## Questions to Consider

- What inherited beliefs about success and limitation might be controlling your current reality?
- If you truly could achieve anything, what would you want, and why aren't you allowing yourself to want it that big?
- Where are you currently treating symptoms rather than changing the thought-patterns causing your circumstances?
- What "authority" have you given power over your decisions, and is it serving or limiting you?
- If thoughts become things, what are you currently thinking into existence?

## Conclusion

"Make Yourself Great Again" is either dangerous or liberating depending on your perspective. If you prefer blaming circumstances, this book will frustrate you with its insistence on personal responsibility. But if you're ready to reclaim your power, it provides a complete toolkit for transforming your inner world and, consequently, your outer reality.

The collection's greatest strength is its comprehensiveness - Worstell doesn't just present one theory but combines decades of wisdom from multiple schools of thought. The practical techniques, especially the Count to Four method, are remarkably simple yet profound. While some readers might find the repetition across volumes redundant, others will appreciate how different authors explain the same principles from varying angles.

Is this worth your time? If you feel stuck, limited, or controlled by external circumstances, absolutely. The biggest reason to read it is that you'll finish knowing - not hoping, not wishing, but knowing - that you have complete creative control over your life experience. The book's promise isn't just success; it's the return to your natural state as a powerful, deliberate creator of your reality.

Worth reading for: The Count to Four technique alone is worth the price - it's a simple, repeatable system that actually works
