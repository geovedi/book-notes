## Core Insights

### Understanding the Forex Market

Forex (Foreign Exchange) is the world's most liquid market with over $3 trillion in daily trading volume—equivalent to 2-3 months of New York Stock Exchange trading in a single day. Unlike stock markets with central exchanges, forex trades over-the-counter (OTC) 24 hours a day, 5 days a week, from Sydney Monday morning to New York Friday evening. The market is dominated by major banks and financial institutions (50% of transactions), central banks, corporations hedging currency risk, and increasingly, individual speculators.

> "One day of FX is roughly 2 to 3 months of trading volume on the New York Stock Exchange. This is powerful, it means a lot of liquidity and that a lot of people are involved in it."

**Quick Take**: Forex offers unmatched liquidity and flexibility, making it ideal for traders who can't monitor markets during traditional hours, but requires understanding its unique OTC structure and global participants.

### Essential Trading Tools: 3-Way Orders

The cornerstone of professional trading is the "3-way order" system: an entry order, a limit (profit-taking) order, and a stop-loss order. This framework provides discipline, enables remote trading, and removes emotion from decision-making. Walker emphasizes that professional traders always define their exit parameters before entering a trade, with risk-reward ratios typically of 2:1 or 3:1.

> "One thing is noted as the key difference between those who make a profit trading and those who are losing, is having the parameters set before trading."

**Quick Take**: 3-way orders create automatic discipline by forcing you to define risk, reward, and exit points before trading begins—eliminating emotional interference in your strategy.

### Ratio Trading and Risk Management

Successful traders focus on risk-reward ratios rather than being "right" about market direction. A typical setup might involve entering at 1.5550, setting a stop loss at 1.5525 (25 pips risk), and taking profit at 1.5600 (50 pips reward)—creating a 2:1 ratio. This approach, combined with strict position sizing (never risking more than 1-2% of your account on any single trade), forms the foundation of sustainable trading.

> "When you are using ratio trading in your strategy, it must be that your chance of making a profit is greater than the chance of a loss."

**Quick Take**: Focus on making your profitable trades larger than your losses rather than trying to be right about market direction—a 2:1 risk-reward ratio means you can be wrong twice and still break even with one winning trade.

### Common Trading Mistakes and Solutions

Most retail traders fail due to unrealistic expectations, lack of planning, excessive risk, and confusing trading with investing. Walker provides concrete solutions: use low leverage to give yourself time to think, scale into positions gradually (start with 20-25% of your intended position), and trade only highly liquid markets. He emphasizes that trading is an income-generating activity, not long-term investing.

> "Trading is about making money, it is income generating activity. You are moving in and out of trades, unlike investing which is more long term."

**Quick Take**: Start small, use low leverage, and trade only liquid markets you understand well—treat trading as a business focused on income generation, not get-rich-quick speculation.

### Technical Analysis Framework

Walker presents a streamlined technical analysis approach using chart time frames, Bollinger Bands for identifying reversal levels, and RSI (Relative Strength Index) for momentum confirmation. Key settings include RSI periods of 7 for swing trading and 4 for day trading, with focus on identifying ideal buy signals (RSI rising from 30-40 levels near bottom of Bollinger channel) and sell signals (opposite conditions).

> "Charts are for 'indicative purposes only', they are not the market, yet you want charts that give a good idea of where the market is."

**Quick Take**: Use multiple time frames for context, wait for confirmation between indicators (don't trade mixed signals), and remember that charts show market behavior—they don't predict it with certainty.

## Conclusion

"Tested Forex Strategies" delivers exactly what its title promises—a practical, no-nonsense approach to currency trading that prioritizes risk management and systematic execution over complex theories. Walker's background as both a professional trader and educator shines through in his ability to distill sophisticated concepts into actionable strategies.

This book is worth your time if you're serious about forex trading and prefer substance over hype. It's particularly valuable for its emphasis on professional trading habits like 3-way orders, ratio trading, and scaling techniques that most retail traders never learn. The biggest takeaway is that successful trading isn't about predicting markets—it's about managing risk, maintaining discipline, and having a systematic approach that works regardless of market conditions.

While the book could benefit from more detailed examples and expanded technical analysis sections, it provides a solid foundation that most traders can build upon. At its current length and price point, it offers excellent value compared to comprehensive but overwhelming alternatives that often cost much more while delivering less practical guidance.
