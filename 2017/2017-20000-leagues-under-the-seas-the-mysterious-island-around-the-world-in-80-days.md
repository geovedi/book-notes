## The Three Adventures

### 20,000 Leagues Under the Seas (1870)

The story begins with mysterious sightings of an enormous "sea monster" attacking ships worldwide. Professor Pierre Aronnax, a French marine biologist, joins an American expedition aboard the frigate Abraham Lincoln to hunt this creature. After a confrontation, Aronnax, his servant Conseil, and Canadian harpooner Ned Land are thrown overboard and discover the "monster" is actually the Nautilus, an advanced submarine commanded by the enigmatic Captain Nemo.

Taken aboard the Nautilus against their will, they embark on an incredible underwater journey spanning 20,000 leagues. Captain Nemo, a brilliant but bitter scientist who has rejected human society, reveals to them the wonders of the deep ocean: lost cities, spectacular marine life, and the technological marvels of his vessel. The narrative explores themes of freedom versus captivity, scientific discovery, and the conflict between individual conscience and societal injustice.

**Key Turning Points**: The dramatic capture of the protagonists, the discovery of Atlantis, the battle with giant squid, and the final escape from the Nautilus as it disappears into a maelstrom.

**Emotional Core**: The moral ambiguity of Captain Nemo—genius, visionary, and terrorist—forces readers to question the boundaries between justice and revenge, progress and destruction.

### Around the World in 80 Days (1873)

Phileas Fogg, an obsessively precise English gentleman living in London, makes a £20,000 wager at his club that he can circumnavigate the globe in exactly eighty days. Accompanied only by his newly hired French servant Passepartout, Fogg sets off on a race against time using every available form of 19th-century transportation: steamers, railways, elephants, and even wind-powered sleds.

The journey becomes a global adventure as they travel through Suez, India, Hong Kong, Japan, America, and back to England. They are relentlessly pursued by Detective Fix, who mistakenly believes Fogg is a bank robber. Along the way, they rescue the beautiful Princess Aouda from being sacrificed in India, who becomes their companion and Fogg's eventual love interest.

**Key Turning Points**: The rescue of Princess Aouda, the attack by Sioux warriors in America, the missed steamship in China, and the realization that they've gained an extra day by crossing the International Date Line.

**Emotional Core**: The transformation of the emotionless, mechanical Fogg through his friendships and growing love for Aouda, proving that the greatest discoveries are often human connections rather than geographical ones.

### The Mysterious Island (1874)

Five Americans—Cyrus Smith, a brilliant engineer; Gideon Spilett, a journalist; Neb, Smith's loyal servant; sailor Jack Pencroft; and Herbert Brown, a young naturalist—escape a Civil War prison in a balloon during a hurricane. After five days aloft, they crash-land on a mysterious, uncharted island in the Pacific.

Using Smith's scientific knowledge and Pencroft's practical skills, they establish a thriving colony called "Lincoln Island." They discover the island holds many secrets: abundant resources, strange phenomena, and apparently a mysterious benefactor who helps them during crises. Their survival story showcases human ingenuity, cooperation, and the application of scientific principles to overcome nature's challenges.

**Key Turning Points**: The discovery of their mysterious benefactor, the pirate attack on their colony, the arrival of the dying Captain Nemo, and the volcanic eruption that forces their ultimate rescue.

**Emotional Core**: The revelation that their mysterious helper has been Captain Nemo all along, connecting the stories and revealing themes of redemption and the enduring power of human compassion.
