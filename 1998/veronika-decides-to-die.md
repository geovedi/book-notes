# Veronika Decides To Die

Paulo Coelho (1998)

***

Paulo Coelho questions the foundation of a capitalist society, where an ever-expanding web of rules and constraints drives the population straight into depression.

With a burning desire to fit in and conform to their neighbours, people are constantly suppressing their deepest impulses and dreams. But here's the kicker: It's crucial that every one of us discovers our "real I," our true essence, to breathe meaning back into our lives and avoid plunging into the depths of insanity and despair.

We must unveil our authentic selves, embracing our aspirations, dreams, and plans to find happiness. All those psychological disturbances that plague us are the byproduct of the self-censorship we impose on ourselves to resemble the masses. We hold back from revealing our dreams, uncertainties, and unique characteristics to blend in with the crowd. And that is what ultimately hampers our well-being.

Quote #1

> Insanity is the inability to communicate your ideas. It's as if you were in a foreign country, able to see and understand everything that's happening around you but incapable of explaining what you need to know or being helped because you don't understand the language they speak there. 

Quote #2

> It is if you force yourself to be the same as everyone else. It causes neuroses, psychoses, and paranoia. It's a distortion of nature; it goes against God's laws, for He did not create a single leaf-like another in all the world's woods and forests.

At a particular juncture, Veronika's imagination begins to paint a rather bleak picture of her life—a monotonous job, a marriage she feels compelled to enter into, being a people-pleaser, having children in an attempt to salvage her union, all while suppressing her desire to end her life until the kids grow older.

It becomes apparent that Veronika has always adhered to the expectations and image imposed by others, denying herself the freedom to be herself.

The love story between Veronika and Eduard is quite poignant. Their heartfelt confessions and Eduard's plea for Veronika to stay by his side add emotional depth to their connection.

Interestingly enough, it is through helping Eduard that Veronika discovers a newfound sense of purpose in life. In aiding him, she finds solace and a reason to carry on.

Another intriguing aspect is Igor's role, playing God in his way. His desire to test his theories by conducting experiments brings forth thought-provoking ideas. He presents a valid argument that making individuals aware of their mortality can be an effective means of healing patients.

In Veronika's journey, intertwined with the complex dynamics of love, purpose, and the human condition, the story explores themes that delve into the depths of the soul and provoke contemplation on the nature of existence.

## Storyline

### Veronika Seeking Death

In late 1997, Veronika decided to die. Not because she's feeling down or sorrowful but because life fails to captivate her. To the Slovenian lass, each day appears monotonous, and after her youth slips away, she becomes convinced that she will never encounter further degradation or suffering. Moreover, she's acutely aware that the world is declining and feels utterly powerless in the face of it all. Not wishing to burden anyone with the discovery of her lifeless body, she methodically rules out hanging, jumping from the window, and shooting. Instead, she opts to ingest four boxes of sleeping pills. Initially overcome by an inclination to vomit, she eventually succumbs to unconsciousness.

Despite her desperate attempt, Veronika awakens in a hospital bed at Villete. Confined within a mental institution, her mind begins to conjure visions of the life that awaits her upon release: an uninspiring job, a husband she will wed solely to appease her mother, the arrival of a baby destined to salvage her crumbling marriage, a suppressed urge to take her own life until her children grow older, and an eventual yet futile suicide bid. Reflecting upon these thoughts, she resolves not to leave the clinic alive, prepared to leap from a window if necessary, should she fail to acquire the means to end her existence.

Subjected to a sedated stupor for nearly three weeks, Veronika learns from a doctor that the sleeping pills she consumed have irreparably damaged her heart, sealing her fate with imminent death. Although the physician informs her that she has a mere five to seven days left to live, it's a fabrication of sorts—a therapeutic deception, if you will—as the young woman is, in fact, in good health. Overwhelmed by panic at the prospect of awaiting her demise for an entire week, she embarks on a quest to find more sleeping pills, yearning to expedite her death. Yet, her search proves futile, leaving her with no choice but to patiently await her impending death.

Whilst traversing this tumultuous path, she gradually forges friendships with her fellow patients. Among them is Zedka, a long-standing sufferer of depression; Maria, plagued by panic disorder; and Eduard, a silent presence grappling with schizophrenia. Over these fleeting days, she bears witness to the treatment sessions inflicted upon her comrades—an injection of insulin plunging Zedka into a coma, the administration of electroshocks rendering Eduard unconscious. These brutal methods of intervention shock her to the core.

Veronika embarks on a profound contemplation of her existence as time trickles by. She grapples with the realisation that she has perpetually conformed to the perceptions others hold of her, stifling her true self in the process. For instance, she studied law to appease her mother, despite her deep desire to pursue a career as a pianist. Consequently, an all-consuming loathing festers within her, bursting forth as she hammers the keys of the hospital's central piano in a wild frenzy. In the aftermath of this outburst, a wave of tranquillity washes over her, and she proceeds to weave intricate melodies—sonatas and odes—to the moon, the stars, the asylum's grounds, and the towering mountains. Eduard becomes enchanted by Veronika's music, but sensing an impending end, she cautions him not to grow too accustomed, for she will soon depart from this mortal coil.

Merely days before her intended departure from this realm, fate deals Veronika a cruel blow—a heart attack that leaves her alive and gasping for breath. Overwhelmed by hysteria, she rails against the perceived insensitivity of the medical team, unable to comprehend why they refuse to curtail the suffering they know she is condemned to endure. Her despair erupts in a torrent of rebellion that forces the nurses to administer sedatives, quelling her tumultuous outburst.

Subsequently, Veronika partakes in an intervention facilitated by a Sufi master, a figure of spiritual wisdom. Under his guidance, the hospice patients are implored to liberate their spirits, to embark upon a journey towards discovering their true essence. During this transformative encounter, Veronika, in a sudden flash of realisation, becomes acutely aware of her authentic self, her "real 'I'". She comprehends the rashness with which she attempted to end her own life, understanding that fearing death only leads to squandering the precious moments that remain. With this newfound clarity, she resolves to seize the fleeting fragments of existence, determined to extract every ounce of joy and meaning from her limited time on Earth.

The fateful hour dawns upon Veronika as her appointed physician, Dr Igor, solemnly reveals that she has only 24 hours left to inhabit this earthly realm. A distressing turn of events unfolds as she readies herself to depart from the hospital, seeking to seize every last drop of her dwindling time. Eduard, brought forth by the doctors, is to be subjected to the harsh ordeal of electroshock therapy. Without hesitation, Veronika resolves to remain steadfastly by his side, providing solace and support amidst his tribulation.

Zedka, bidding her farewells before departing from Villete, imparts her final wisdom upon Veronika. Encouraging her to embrace the risk of love, she reminds her there is nothing to lose in such a pursuit. And so, as Eduard awakens, he musters the courage to confess his love to Veronika, divulging his own story in the process. He reveals his burning desire to become a painter, yet his parents, deeming him deranged, had him committed to the asylum.

In turn, Veronika reciprocates his love, baring her heart to him. She beseeches Eduard to remain by her side until her last breath, their connection forged by a profound yearning for freedom. Together, they make a daring decision to escape the confines of the asylum, propelled by the belief that Veronika's purpose lies in revitalising Eduard's artistic vocation. She implores him to promise that he will paint her portrait and continue pursuing his art. And so, in the embrace of Eduard's arms, Veronika surrenders to a peaceful slumber, fully convinced that she will not awaken again.

However, as the next day dawns, they discover with astonishment that Veronika remains among the living, deeming it a miraculous occurrence. In this twist of fate, their intertwined destinies unfold, bound by love, art, and the extraordinary journey they are destined to embark upon together.

### Igor Seeking Life

Dr Igor, the proprietor of Villete Asylum, holds firm convictions about depression and its connection to the human condition. According to his theory, everyone, except those deemed insane, experiences depression only when circumstances permit. That is to say when they are not directly affected by the ravages of war or famine. Thus, faced with the looming spectre of death, Veronika and her fellow patients embark on a profound contemplation of their lives and future.

In one such revelation, Maria, touched by her interactions with Veronika, rediscovers her soul. Encountering Veronika has rekindled her desire to embrace experiences she has long withheld. Empowered by this newfound clarity, Maria bid farewell to the establishment, determined to live without regrets.

Meanwhile, Dr Igor, the master of manipulation, weaves a deceptive web around Veronika. He fabricates her imminent demise, using her as a subject in an experiment designed to validate his theories. Firm in his belief that awareness of death is the catalyst for healing and liberating patients from their resentments, he cunningly manipulates Veronika's perception of her mortality, fanning the flames of her will to live. The doctor's deception extends to the injections Veronika receives, which, unbeknownst to her, are merely meant to provoke symptoms resembling a heart attack.

Ultimately, Dr Igor's hypothesis finds affirmation as Veronika, convinced of her impending demise, rediscovers her zest for life. Seizing each day as if it were her last, she embraces the gift of existence, casting aside inhibitions and fully immersing herself in the present moment. The doctor's controversial methods may have achieved their desired effect, but Veronika's transformation is a testament to the human spirit's resilience and capacity for growth.
