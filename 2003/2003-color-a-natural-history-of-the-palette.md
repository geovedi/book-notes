## Core Insights

### The Global Origins of Color
Every color in our palette has a geographical and cultural birthplace. Finlay travels to remote corners of the world to trace each pigment to its source, revealing how colors are intrinsically linked to specific places, peoples, and traditions.

**Quick Take**: Colors carry the DNA of their origins, connecting us to specific places and histories around the globe.

### Colors as Economic and Political Power
Throughout history, control over color sources meant wealth and power.
