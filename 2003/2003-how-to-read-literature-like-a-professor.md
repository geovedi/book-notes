# How to Read Literature Like a Professor
**Author**: Thomas C. Foster | **Year**: 2003

## Summary
This book demystifies literary analysis by revealing the hidden codes, patterns, and conventions that professors use to understand literature. Foster argues that reading literature isn't about memorizing facts or finding "the right answer"—it's about learning to recognize the symbolic language that writers use to communicate deeper meanings. The book teaches readers to look beyond the surface story to uncover the universal patterns, mythological references, and symbolic elements that give literature its power and resonance.

Perfect for students, book club members, or any reader who wants to deepen their appreciation of literature, this guide transforms reading from a passive activity into an engaging treasure hunt for meaning.

## Core Insights

### The Three Tools of Professorial Reading
**Memory. Symbol. Pattern.** These three elements separate the analytical reader from the casual one. Professors constantly make connections to other works (memory), see symbolic meaning in objects and actions (symbol), and recognize recurring structures across different works (pattern). Foster argues that literature is built on a shared set of conventions and references—once you learn this "grammar of literature," you start seeing connections everywhere.

> "English professors, as a class, are cursed with memory. Whenever I read a new work, I spin the mental Rolodex looking for correspondences and corollaries—where have I seen his face, don't I know that theme?"

**Quick Take**: Reading gets richer when you start connecting each book to everything else you've read.

### Every Trip Is a Quest (Except When It's Not)
Foster reveals that quest stories follow a universal five-element structure: (1) a quester, (2) a place to go, (3) a stated reason to go there, (4) challenges and trials en route, and (5) a real reason to go there. The crucial insight: the real reason is always self-knowledge, while the stated reason is usually just a MacGuffin. This pattern appears everywhere from The Lord of the Rings to The Crying of Lot 49.

> "The real reason for a quest never involves the stated reason. In fact, more often than not, the quester fails at the stated task... The real reason for a quest is always self-knowledge."

**Quick Take**: When characters hit the road, look for how the journey changes them, not just what they find.

### Communion: More Than Just Dinner
Whenever characters eat or drink together, it's communion—an act of sharing and peace that signifies community and relationship. Foster notes that meal scenes are difficult to write and inherently boring, so authors only include them when they serve a deeper purpose. The way characters share food reveals everything about their relationships and social dynamics.

> "Whenever people eat or drink together, it's communion... We're quite particular about those with whom we break bread."

**Quick Take**: Pay attention to who eats together and how—the dynamics at the dinner table mirror the story's central conflicts.

### Vampires: The Ultimate Exploitation
Vampire stories aren't just about literal bloodsuckers—they're about exploitation, selfishness, and the violation of others' autonomy. The pattern: an older figure (symbolizing corrupt values) preys on the young (especially young women), stealing their vitality and innocence. This metaphor appears everywhere from Dracula to Daisy Miller, where social vampires consume their victims without supernatural powers.

> "Ghosts and vampires are never only about ghosts and vampires... Using other people to get what we want. Denying someone else's right to live in the face of our overwhelming demands."

**Quick Take**: Look for vampire-like dynamics wherever characters use others for personal gain.

### Geography Matters: Place as Character
Setting is never accidental—it shapes mood, influences characters, and often symbolizes emotional states. A journey south might represent a descent into chaos, while going west could mean escaping civilization. Rivers often symbolize life and change, while mountains represent spiritual insight or challenge. Foster encourages readers to ask: why here and why now?

> "Geography in literature can also be more than setting or a source of symbolism... Sometimes, place is the character."

**Quick Take**: Treat settings like characters—they have personalities, motivations, and symbolic weight.

### Seasons: Nature's Emotional Calendar
Spring = youth, rebirth, and new beginnings
Summer = passion, adulthood, and fulfillment
Fall = decline, maturity, and harvest
Winter = death, old age, and endings
This seasonal symbolism operates so deeply in Western literature that writers hardly need to explain it. Understanding these associations reveals layers of meaning that casual readers miss.

**Quick Take**: Notice how the weather and season mirror characters' emotional states.

## Best Quotes

- "Memory. Symbol. Pattern. These are the three items that, more than any other, separate the professorial reader from the rest of the crowd."

- "Whenever people eat or drink together, it's communion."

- "The real reason for a quest is always self-knowledge."

- "Ghosts and vampires are never only about ghosts and vampires."

- "Literature has its grammar, too. You knew that, of course. Even if you didn't know that, you knew from the structure of the preceding paragraph that it was coming."

## Action Items

- **Start a reading journal**: Track connections between books—notice recurring symbols, themes, and patterns across different works.

- **Ask "why this?"**: When an author includes specific details (meals, weather, geography), ask why it matters rather than accepting it at face value.

- **Look for the universal**: Recognize how individual stories connect to broader myths, fairy tales, and religious narratives.

- **Practice the three tools**: Consciously develop memory (connect to other works), symbol (look for deeper meaning), and pattern (recognize recurring structures).

- **Read actively**: Keep Foster's analytical framework in mind but don't let it overshadow your emotional response to literature.

## Questions to Consider

- How does the author use setting to reveal character or advance theme?

- How does this story connect to other works you've read—is it part of a larger literary conversation?
