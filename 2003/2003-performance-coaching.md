# Performance Coaching: The Handbook for Managers, H.R. Professionals and Coaches
**Authors**: Angus I. McLeod, PhD | **Year**: 2003

## Summary
"Performance Coaching" is a comprehensive guide that transforms the art of coaching into a systematic, learnable skill set for business professionals. McLeod presents coaching not as a mysterious talent but as a disciplined practice built on three fundamental instruments: silence, questions, and challenge. The book bridges the gap between counseling psychology and business performance, offering practical tools that managers, HR professionals, and dedicated coaches can immediately apply to unlock human potential in organizational settings.

This work stands out by integrating multiple disciplines—including Neuro-Linguistic Programming (NLP), David Grove's "clean language," and symbolic modeling—into a coherent coaching methodology. McLeod's STEPPPA model provides a structured yet flexible framework for ensuring coachees develop motivated, actionable strategies for success.

This book is essential for managers who want to move beyond traditional command-and-control leadership, HR professionals developing organizational coaching programs, and professional coaches seeking to deepen their practice. Readers will gain the confidence to handle sensitive workplace issues, facilitate breakthrough insights, and guide others to self-generated solutions that drive sustainable performance improvement.

## Core Insights

### The Three Principal Instruments of Coaching
McLeod identifies silence, questions, and challenge as the foundational tools that underpin all effective coaching interventions. Of these, silence emerges as the most powerful because it creates the psychological space for coachees to experience their own breakthroughs and insights. The real work of coaching happens during these silent moments when individuals process information, re-evaluate beliefs, and develop new perspectives without the coach's agenda interfering.

> "The principal instruments of coaching are silence, questions, and challenge. Of the three instruments, silence is the most effective."

Questions serve multiple purposes: they unlock information for both parties, help coachees explore different realities, and can even be used in "context-free" coaching where sensitive details remain private while solutions emerge. Challenge provides the confrontational energy needed to break through limiting beliefs and stuck patterns, often requiring coachees to reframe their perceptions dramatically.

**Quick Take**: Master the art of strategic silence before developing sophisticated questioning techniques. The most transformative coaching moments happen in the quiet spaces between interventions.

### The STEPPPA Coaching Model
STEPPPA represents McLeod's signature coaching framework, ensuring coachees develop complete, motivated strategies for success. Each step builds upon the previous to create comprehensive action plans:

- **Subject**: The initial issue or topic the coachee brings
- **Target**: The specific objective or outcome desired
- **Emotion**: The emotional context driving both subject and target
- **Perception**: Re-evaluating current viewpoints and possibilities
- **Plan**: A structured procedure of steps leading to the target
- **Pace**: Checking strategy realism and understanding success/failure implications
- **Adapt or Act**: The final decision point to adjust the strategy or take action

The model's genius lies in its comprehensive nature—it addresses not just what people want to achieve, but why they want it (emotion), how they currently see the situation (perception), and whether their plan is realistic given their resources and constraints (pace).

**Quick Take**: Use STEPPPA as a checklist rather than a rigid script. The steps may occur out of order, but every element must be addressed for sustainable success.

### Context-Free Coaching for Sensitive Issues
One of McLeod's most valuable contributions is the concept of "context-free coaching"—a method for helping coachees solve highly sensitive workplace issues without revealing confidential details. This approach uses carefully crafted questions that allow exploration of solutions without requiring disclosure of specific people, situations, or politically charged information.

Context-free coaching proves invaluable when dealing with issues involving senior executives, confidential company matters, or politically sensitive relationships. The coach can facilitate powerful interventions without needing (or having) access to sensitive details, protecting both the coachee and the organization while still generating breakthrough solutions.

**Quick Take**: Practice context-free questioning by focusing on patterns, structures, and personal responses rather than specific events or individuals involved in workplace challenges.

### The Hierarchy of Logical Levels
Building on Gregory Bateson's work, McLeod demonstrates how coaching interventions must match the appropriate level of influence to be effective. The hierarchy moves from environment (lowest influence, highest dominance) to purpose/vision (highest influence, lowest dominance): Environment → Behavior → Capabilities → Beliefs → Identity → Purpose/Vision.

Effective coaches diagnose at which level their coachee is stuck and apply interventions at or above that level. For example, someone who believes they're "useless at presentations" needs work at the belief level, not just behavior-level technique training.

**Quick Take**: When coachees seem stuck despite behavior changes, check if limiting beliefs or identity issues are the real barriers. Interventions at higher levels often produce breakthroughs faster than technique-focused approaches.

### Communication as the Root of Most Performance Issues
McLeod estimates that 80% of workplace performance issues stem from communication factors—including both the quality of message delivery and, crucially, how messages are interpreted by receivers. He illustrates how the same statement can generate multiple meanings depending on context, relationship history, and the receiver's current state.

This insight redirects coaching attention from skills gaps to communication patterns, relationship dynamics, and interpretation habits. Often, performance improvements come not from learning new technical skills but from clarifying communication expectations, understanding different interpretation styles, and addressing unspoken relationship dynamics.

**Quick Take**: When facing performance issues, first explore communication breakdowns before assuming skill deficiencies. Ask "What might they be hearing differently than you intend?" rather than "What training do they need?"

## Best Quotes
- "In coaching, you have to allow prolonged silences, and intervene to push the coachee to reconnect with the moment, bringing them back to it and keeping anyone else silent."
- "The most motivating behaviors come from self-determined processing."
- "Coaching inspires internally motivated solutions; mentoring invariably offers externally derived solutions."
- "Emotion, once registered (and whether expressed or not), is a key driver for change. Silence and emotion are facilitators of awesome power."
- "Without a foundation in principles, an appropriate mental attitude, and linguistic competencies, these tools are all highly limited."

## Action Items
- Practice strategic silence in your next coaching conversation—wait at least 7 seconds after a coachee's insight before speaking
- Apply the STEPPPA model to your current coaching challenges, checking each element systematically
- Develop context-free questioning skills for handling sensitive workplace issues
- Use the hierarchy of logical levels to diagnose why previous coaching or training efforts may have failed
- Focus on communication patterns and interpretation differences before addressing skill gaps in performance issues

## Questions to Consider
- How comfortable are you with silence in professional conversations? What prevents you from extending quiet moments?
- Which level of the logical hierarchy do you typically address in your coaching? Where might you need to elevate your interventions?
- How can you adapt the STEPPPA model for your specific coaching context and client needs?
- What sensitive issues in your organization could benefit from context-free coaching approaches?
- How might your coaching change if you viewed 80% of performance issues as communication problems rather than skill deficiencies?

## Conclusion
"Performance Coaching" deserves your time because it democratizes coaching skills, making them accessible to managers and HR professionals without diluting their effectiveness. McLeod's greatest contribution is demonstrating that coaching excellence comes from mastering fundamental principles—silence, questioning, and challenge—rather than accumulating fancy techniques or proprietary models.

The book's value lies in its practical orientation; every concept is illustrated with real coaching dialogues and workplace examples. Readers won't just understand coaching theory—they'll recognize their own workplace challenges in the examples and gain confidence to apply the approaches immediately.

The biggest reason to read this book is its potential to transform your approach to human development at work. By shifting from advice-giving to solution-facilitating, you'll help others generate sustainable motivation and ownership while avoiding the dependency that traditional mentoring often creates. In an era where adaptive capability and continuous learning determine organizational success, these coaching skills aren't just nice-to-have—they're essential leadership competencies.
