## Prologue: A Party out of Control 

Shawn Fanning, the founder of Napster, experiences a rollercoaster of emotions at a Halloween rave sponsored by Napster, reflecting on his remarkable journey from a challenging childhood to becoming a prominent figure in the internet boom of the San Francisco Bay Area. Alongside his team members Sean Parker and Jordan Ritter, they navigate the highs and lows of Napster's rise and subsequent legal battles.

Eileen Richardson, the interim CEO of Napster, envisions the company as a catalyst for revolutionising the music industry by sponsoring events like the rave to engage young music enthusiasts and promote new artists. However, internal power dynamics, particularly the dominance of Shawn's uncle John Fanning, affect Napster's decision-making and hinder negotiations with the record industry. Despite facing numerous obstacles and ultimately filing for bankruptcy, the impact of Napster and the rise of peer-to-peer file sharing on the music industry remains significant, and their journey is described as an incredible adventure filled with triumphs and setbacks.

## The Rebels 

The rise of Napster, a pioneering file-sharing platform during the Web boom, is highlighted, emphasising its rapid growth and significant impact on the music industry. The early stages of Napster's development and its revolutionary nature are explored.

Shawn Fanning's background and upbringing in a struggling Irish family are discussed. His passion for music and early exposure to computers and programming are mentioned, shedding light on the factors that shaped his journey.

The involvement of mentors and family support is touched upon, with Fanning's mother and uncle playing crucial roles in his life. His uncle, John Fanning, provided financial aid as a mentor, while his mother encouraged his academic pursuits and programming exploration.

Additionally, the text delves into Fanning's participation in hacker communities, such as w00w00 and Asylum, highlighting these groups' collaborative and educational aspects. The meeting of Fanning and Sean Parker, another critical figure in the story, is briefly mentioned, setting the stage for their future endeavours in the development of Napster.

## A Big Idea 

In the late 1990s, digital music faced reliability issues and cumbersome downloading methods. Shawn Fanning aimed to address these problems and revolutionise music distribution. The rise of MP3 technology and faster internet connections provided the perfect environment for the spread of digital music. Platforms like IUMA, Winamp, and MP3.com contributed to the popularity of MP3s, although musicians and record labels had mixed reactions to the technology.

Shawn Fanning's breakthrough came from his experience on Internet Relay Chat (IRC), inspiring him to create a real-time index for available music files. This led to the development of Napster, a file-sharing system that connected users and facilitated music downloads. Napster stood out with its unique feature of simultaneous file sharing, allowing users to share their music and download from others. The architecture of Napster mimicked search engines like Google, utilising a decentralised approach.

Shawn sought guidance and support from the w00w00 IRC channel and its members, who played a crucial role in the development of Napster. IRC provided a platform for sharing code, discussing protocol design, and exchanging knowledge among hackers and programmers. Shawn's friend, Sean Parker, recognised the business potential of Napster and urged him to secure funding for additional servers. Jordan Ritter, a w00w00 member, helped enhance the code and ensure scalability for handling many users. While Shawn's dedication and enthusiasm were unwavering, Ritter had reservations about Napster's management and business aspects. Nonetheless, Shawn remained confident in the immense success that Napster would achieve.

## Birth of a Business 

John Fanning, Shawn Fanning's uncle, had a history of business struggles, including failed ventures like Cambridge Automation. He became involved in online chess through the Internet Chess Club (ICC) but faced rejection when he tried to acquire Sleator Games, the company behind ICC. This led him to start his rival service, Chess.net, sparking a legal battle and ongoing animosity between Fanning and ICC.

While Fanning built a following for Chess.net by offering free games and additional services, the company faced internal issues due to financial mismanagement and unpaid bills. Fanning's personal and business affairs intertwined, including using his wife's credit card for business expenses. He faced numerous lawsuits and financial troubles, even engaging in a physical altercation that resulted in criminal charges and a civil case against him and his brother.

In the context of the early Internet, Shawn Fanning's vision for Napster aligned with the original ideals of an open and non-profit-driven environment. However, the internet landscape shifted towards focusing on business strategies and quick profits. Shawn left college to pursue Napster full-time, despite disappointment from his mother. John Fanning saw Napster as a path to riches. He claimed the majority ownership of the company, leading to a strained relationship between him and Shawn, who felt powerless to regain control over his creation. Emotionally, Shawn struggled with the control his uncle had over Napster.

## Getting Money 

Shawn Fanning's friend Sean Parker recognised the money-making potential of Napster and began reaching out to investors. Ben Lilienthal, who had recently sold his company Nascent Technologies, expressed interest in running Napster and contacted investor Jason Grosfeld. Lilienthal and Grosfeld visited Napster's disorganised office in Hull, impressed by Shawn Fanning's coding skills but concerned about his uncle John Fanning's management style. They planned to explore the legal issues surrounding Napster and move the core Napster machine to a server farm.

Lilienthal and Grosfeld had different approaches, with Grosfeld being cautious and wanting to secure a deal before pursuing venture funding, while Lilienthal wanted to move quickly. Lilienthal trusted the venture investors he had in mind and believed they would do the right thing. They discussed the possibility of a commission for bringing in venture funding, but it needed to be more critical for Lilienthal. Despite Grosfeld's advice, Lilienthal contacted John Backus at Draper Atlantic, a venture firm known for moving quickly. Lilienthal and Parker outlined Napster's plan, emphasising a user-focused approach and selling ancillary products.

After meeting with Backus and Jim Lynch of Draper Atlantic, who showed immediate interest, Lilienthal and Grosfeld were surprised by the speed of the venture capitalists' actions and the lack of negotiation for their commission—the term sheet called for Draper Atlantic to invest $500,000 and take a minority position in Napster. Fanning hesitated, wanting a more significant investment, but Lilienthal assured him it was a generous deal. They celebrated at a fancy restaurant, but Lilienthal and Parker missed their flight back to Washington because Parker forgot his asthma inhaler, leading to a chaotic journey. Lilienthal reconsidered Parker's role in the company and his ability to navigate challenges.

Due diligence revealed Fanning's overdue debts and assault charge, but the primary concern was copyright law. Grosfeld spent two months researching copyright law, including the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA). The safe harbour provisions for Internet service providers were considered, but Napster's circumstances posed challenges. The Sony VCR case set a precedent for copying equipment with substantial non-infringing uses, but it would be harder for Napster to make that argument. Grosfeld's research uncovered the Fonovisa Inc. v. Cherry Auction Inc. case, emphasising the importance of knowledge of wrongdoing and the ability to stop it. Fanning researched and sought legal help from Seth Greenstein to develop a legal rationale for Napster.

Lilienthal and Grosfeld considered licensing Napster's file-swapping technology but sought to reduce Fanning's control over the company. Negotiations with Fanning failed, and Napster continued to attract more users while facing financial difficulties. Fanning secured a $50,000 loan from Draper and tried to enlist other connections, but deals fell through due to Fanning's control issues. The Shinns, who recognised Napster's potential, formed their firm and discussed collaboration with Shawn Fanning. They offered Shawn a million dollars, but he declined, citing his lack of business knowledge and emotional attachment to his uncle. John Fanning continued seeking funding for Napster and met with venture capitalist Andy Evans. Still, the deal fell due to concerns about his control and damaging information from Jordan Ritter. Yosi Amram eventually invested in Napster, saving the company.

## Going West 

Shawn Fanning and Sean Parker relocated to California as demanded by Yosi Amram. They faced logistical challenges and needed to learn more about the executives at Napster. Eileen Richardson, a venture capitalist passionate about music, was the temporary CEO. Richardson was motivated to prove herself and possibly outshine her ex-boyfriend, John Lee. She had a successful background in venture capital, but her relationship with Interwoven and Lee created complications.

Napster's early focus was raising money and rapidly expanding its user base. The company needed a more transparent business plan and debated various monetisation strategies. Richardson planned to rely on experienced venture capitalists to determine a suitable business model and secure funding. The company aimed to coexist temporarily with the record industry and leverage its user base to negotiate deals. They prioritised hiring and fundraising, resulting in diverse employees with unconventional backgrounds.

Napster sought legal representation and eventually secured a lawyer from Fenwick & West. The board focused on raising money from angel investors and approached Ron Conway, a prominent figure in Silicon Valley known for making successful investments. The dot-com boom was characterised by speculative companies going public without profits. Conway quickly invested in hot start-ups and used his network and media hype to attract other investors.

Napster secured a significant investment from Conway's fund, which helped convince venture capitalists of its potential. However, a dispute with Draper Atlantic, the venture firm that had previously loaned Napster $50,000, caused complications in securing new financing. The conflict details were kept private, making Napster difficult in the investment process. The dispute lingered for over a year, causing uncertainty and challenges for the company.

Napster faced numerous challenges in its early days, including legal concerns, monetisation strategies, and investor disputes. The company's focus on user growth and its unique approach to music sharing attracted attention but also raised legal and copyright issues. Despite these challenges, Napster continued to expand its user base and attract interest from investors, albeit with some complications and disagreements along the way.

## Fame 

Despite the chaos in Napster's business operations, the engineers kept the system running smoothly as the user base grew. Shawn Fanning and Sean Parker experienced excitement, including seeing the name "Napster" mentioned on MTV. The engineers celebrated technical breakthroughs that increased the system's capacity. Napster's employees embraced a rock 'n' roll culture and had unconventional work hours.

Napster initially needed an in-house PR person and focused on staying under the radar until they had more negotiation leverage. This helped create the perception of Napster as an underdog, and Shawn Fanning became the company's public face. News outlets started covering Napster, highlighting concerns about piracy and copyright infringement. The company faced a lawsuit from major record companies, accusing them of copyright infringement.

Internal conflicts and dysfunction plagued Napster's management team, and clashes between Eileen Richardson and John Fanning caused standoffs. The company's moderation system faced challenges, with incidents of unfair bans and mistreatment of users. Wayne Chang, a high school student and former hacker, managed Napster's publicly accessible message board. Napster faced bans on college campuses and drew media attention.

Napster aimed to gain endorsements from rock stars and musicians to weaken the record companies' arguments against the service. The company faced criticism for its heavy-handed approach in dealing with bands supporting the service. Napster considered selling merchandise but faced internal disputes and copyright issues. The Recording Industry Association sought support from artists against Napster, and Metallica filed a high-profile lawsuit. Hackers and activists became involved in the Napster debate, further fueling tensions and division.

Despite the challenges and controversies, Napster continued attracting users and expanding its available songs library. The company faced criticism and backlash from various stakeholders, including the music industry, record companies, and fans. The legal battle and clashes within the company highlighted the complexities and ethical dilemmas surrounding online file-sharing platforms like Napster.

## The Industry 

Napster executives proposed a New Artist Program to gain support from famous bands and demonstrate legitimate uses of the platform. However, there were internal disagreements about the program's effectiveness and legal implications. The record industry had a history of opposing technological innovations and controlling distribution, which hindered independent artists' access to audiences. Collusion among significant labels led to high CD prices and limited competition.

The record industry launched MusicNet to respond to Napster, but it struggled to attract listeners due to a lack of desirable content and confusing pricing models. Some industry insiders embraced new forms of distribution, but the industry as a whole resisted change. Napster's Eileen Richardson engaged in a public confrontation with a representative from the RIAA, highlighting the tension between Napster and the established industry. Negotiations between Napster and record industry executives could have been more productive.

The RIAA eventually filed a lawsuit against Napster, leading to a shift in the industry's perception of the platform. Record labels focused on getting artists to speak out against Napster and initiated an advertising campaign to shape public opinion. Some artists initially saw the potential of Napster for exposure but later withdrew support due to concerns about settlements and lack of involvement in negotiations. The conflict between Napster and the record industry prompted more artists to criticise unfair contracts and advocate for artists' rights.


## Competition 

Napster faced competition from file-sharing services like Gnutella, CuteMX, iMesh, and Navigator. Gnutella, developed by Winamp creator Justin Frankel, posed a significant threat with its decentralised architecture. Napster's team initially feared Gnutella but eventually recognised its technical challenges and political advantage.

The development of Gnutella was independent of Napster, driven by the belief that file-sharing should be incorporated into Winamp. Seth McGann, a former Napster aide, gained unauthorised access to Gnutella's source code, causing excitement and concern. America Online (AOL) ordered Gnutella's removal from Nullsoft's website, but open-source code emerged, allowing for improvements.

Napster considered adopting features from competitors like segmented downloading but decided against it due to concerns about exposing its knowledge of song locations. Napster hindered iMesh's potential acquisition by AltaVista through hacking and influencing decision-making. The company faced challenges in improving its system due to legal concerns, lack of resources, and distractions from securing venture funding.

OpenNap, a project replicating Napster's server system, threatened Napster's profitability. Tensions and debates arose between Napster's team and the open-source community. Napster engaged in clashes with reverse engineers while discussions expanded to include morality and copyright liability.

Napster explored partnerships for anonymity and bypassing access restrictions. Big companies like Intel developed their peer-to-peer programs, and Gene Kan, a key figure in the Gnutella project, founded Infrasearch. Infrasearch attracted investments and media attention but faced scaling and security challenges.

Sun Microsystems acquired Infrasearch, integrating it into Bill Joy's Jxta project. Napster faced acquisition offers but chose to raise money from venture capitalists independently. Eileen Richardson, Napster's CEO, was cautious about discussing acquisition offers to protect Napster's secrets.


## Venture Games

Eileen Richardson focused on securing venture funding for Napster, but conflicts arose over the control and distribution of funds, leading to financial irregularities. Ownership of shares needed to be clarified, and different prices per share created disagreements. Richardson discovered these irregularities and took control of Napster's money, cutting off payments to John Fanning and others.

Tensions between Richardson and Fanning escalated, with disagreements over the company's stance towards the record industry. Bill Bales, Vice President at Napster, had his conflicts with Richardson and engaged in activities behind her back. The relationship between Bales and Richardson deteriorated, leading to Bales' firing after threats of resignation from other engineers.

Jason Grosfeld, a potential investor, discovered the extent of Fanning's involvement and previous negotiations, leading him to doubt the company's management. Despite Richardson's efforts to secure funding, deals with firms like Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers and Mohr, Davidow Ventures faced setbacks due to Fanning's changing demands and mixed messages.

Hummer Winblad Venture Partners eventually invested $13 million in Napster, with Richardson and Yosi Amram persuading Fanning to support the deal. Fanning agreed, and the investment closed successfully. Richardson resigned from her position, and Hank Barry was appointed as interim CEO.

A former lawyer turned venture capitalist, Barry saw the opportunity in Napster and believed the company would win in court, providing leverage in negotiations with record labels. The investment in Napster caused conflicts with Barry's past representation of copyright holders, but Hummer Winblad approved the decision.

Hummer Winblad's investment in Napster was seen as a potential bailout opportunity, as the firm had struggled to generate significant returns and missed out on the early Internet boom. Despite the financial challenges faced by Hummer Winblad, co-founder John Hummer had a strong faith in Napster and was willing to risk his entire investment.


## Hummer Winblad

Shawn Fanning appeared on the cover of Business Week, boosting Napster's morale. However, Napster faced a lawsuit from the record industry and lost the first battle in court. The case tested the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA) exemptions for service providers, but U.S. district judge Marilyn Hall Patel ruled against Napster. The record industry had experienced lawyers, and Napster's legal team was relatively inexperienced.

Eileen Richardson, the former CEO of Napster, faced a deposition where she struggled to gain support for the New Artist Program from the board and other executives. The valuation of Napster at $65 million by Hummer Winblad was based on gut feeling rather than scientific analysis. Shawn Fanning and Sean Parker faced intense questioning in their depositions, and incriminating documents were discovered that weakened their defence.

The RIAA filed for a preliminary injunction to shut down or restrict Napster, armed with new evidence and Judge Patel's refusal to grant Napster safe harbour. Studies showed declining CD sales and widespread infringement among Napster users. Napster hired renowned litigator David Boies, and significant web intellectuals filed statements supporting Napster, arguing for caution in extinguishing revolutionary developments.

Napster's CEO Hank Barry went on a public relations and political offensive, testifying before Congress. AOL Time Warner considered a takeover bid, but negotiations collapsed. Napster received an emergency stay from Judge Alex Kozinski, allowing the company to remain online while the case was appealed.

Napster's management continued negotiating with the record labels but needed help finding a viable solution. Shawn Fanning's focus shifted away from coding, and Sean Parker resigned after becoming a scapegoat within the company. Napster's discussions for investment by Bertelsmann were accidentally disclosed, revealing potential issues. Despite these challenges, Shawn Fanning remained a prominent figure in the media.

## Bertelsmann

On Halloween Day in 2000, Napster announced an alliance with Bertelsmann AG, the parent company of BMG, to revitalise the struggling record label. Bertelsmann CEO Thomas Middelhoff expressed optimism about the future of file-sharing. The deal was structured as a loan that could convert into majority ownership of Napster, but BMG chose to remain outside the agreement.

Napster's search for a permanent CEO faced challenges, with conflicting ideas and leadership styles causing employee friction. The Ninth Circuit ruled on Judge Patel's preliminary injunction in February 2001, and Napster filed an appeal. The appeals court hearing featured passionate arguments from both sides. Still, ultimately the court ruled unanimously in favour of the music industry, stating that Napster knowingly encouraged and assisted copyright infringement.

Napster's attempt to settle with the labels publicly backfired, and negotiations remained at a standstill. Patel issued a revised injunction, requiring Napster to block identified file names. The company's attempts to implement a screening system could have been better, and users found ways to circumvent the filters. Napster faced internal divisions and fear-driven decision-making.

Napster's appeal to the Ninth Circuit and efforts to meet the court's requirements were unsuccessful. The company's second-generation system for authorised recordings was delayed until early 2002. Napster's demise led to the rise of alternative file-sharing platforms, and Napster turned to lobbying efforts in Washington, D.C., seeking a mandatory license for digital music distribution.

Bertelsmann grew frustrated with Napster's delays and discussed replacing CEO Hank Barry. Konrad Hilbers was appointed Napster's new CEO but faced challenges negotiating deals with major record labels and developing a secure system for Napster's relaunch. Despite receiving 3 million applications for beta testing, Napster faced difficulties securing contracts with the tags, and talks with the RIAA lost momentum. Rival pirate services grew while Napster struggled, and the labels learned that Napster's attention had shifted away from negotiations.

## The Coup

Konrad Hilbers, CEO of Napster, faced financial difficulties and layoffs, leading to the abandonment of talks with record labels. Thomas Middelhoff of Bertelsmann proposed acquiring Napster as an opportunity to strike a deal with the brands. However, Bertelsmann's board members expressed concern about the potential costs and missed deadlines for Napster's relaunch.

Negotiations between Bertelsmann and Napster faced hurdles, including shareholder objections and legal disputes. John Fanning initiated a plan to vote out Hank Barry and John Hummer from the Napster board, but Sean Parker's support for existing management thwarted the coup attempt. The acquisition talks continued, but issues regarding personal liability protection for directors posed challenges.

Hilbers resigned, layoffs were announced, and executives began to resign, causing chaos within the company. Eventually, a Chapter 11 bankruptcy filing was pursued, and a deal was struck with Bertelsmann, resulting in the resignation of Barry and Hummer from the board. Napster rehired its leaders and filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy.

However, Middelhoff's dismissal from Bertelsmann and uncertainties surrounding the legal aspects of Napster's relationship with Bertelsmann created further challenges. Napster's future became uncertain, and the bankruptcy judge ruled against the Bertelsmann purchase of Napster, leading to the company's liquidation.

Roxio Inc. emerged as the top bidder and acquired Napster's assets, marking the company's end.


## Epilogue: After the Revolution

After Napster's bankruptcy, alternative peer-to-peer file-sharing systems like Gnutella, Kazaa, and Grokster emerged, making it challenging to curb piracy. The record industry blamed piracy for declining music sales and experimented with encryption techniques and fake files to frustrate users. This led to clashes between the entertainment and technology industries, with tensions rising as legislation imposing anticopying mechanisms and restrictions on technology companies was introduced.

Silicon Valley became divided, with some advocating for compromises with Hollywood while others fought for technology consumer rights. Companies like Microsoft developed digital rights management systems that gave more control to entertainment companies. The movie industry needed help effectively handling the crisis, such as offering limited protected content and imposing unfavourable usage terms, further frustrating consumers.

During this time, distributed computing projects like SETI@home and FreeNet gained attention, and honest companies began utilising peer-to-peer technologies to save costs and improve efficiency. Meanwhile, key figures from the Napster era faced various challenges and pursued new ventures. Eileen Richardson, the former CEO of Napster, faced criticism and a tarnished reputation without the opportunity to defend herself. Shawn Fanning remained optimistic, exploring computer security issues and focusing on new projects while remaining determined.
