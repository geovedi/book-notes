**Author**: Gleb Tsipursky | **Year**: 2019

## Summary
"Never Go with Your Gut" presents a revolutionary approach to business decision-making that challenges the pervasive but dangerous advice to "trust your instincts." Tsipursky argues that our gut reactions, while evolutionarily adapted for the ancient savanna, are fundamentally mismatched for the modern business environment. The book reveals how cognitive biases systematically lead professionals and organizations toward poor decisions that can devastate careers and companies.

Business leaders, entrepreneurs, and professionals will gain a practical framework for recognizing and counteracting these dangerous judgment errors. By replacing intuition with evidence-based decision-making strategies, readers can avoid common business disasters, seize unexpected opportunities, and gain significant competitive advantages over rivals who continue to rely on flawed instincts.

## Core Insights

### Why "Go With Your Gut" Is Toxic Advice
The most dangerous falsehood in business leadership is the advice to trust your instincts. Our intuition evolved for survival in ancient environments, not for navigating complex modern business challenges. Studies show that successful companies and careers are frequently destroyed by gut-based decisions, from the dotcom bust to corporate scandals. Our minds can't distinguish between learned, effective decision-making patterns and dangerous primitive instincts—both feel equally intuitive and comfortable.

> "Trusting our instincts feels comfortable. We tend to choose what's comfortable rather than what's true or good for us, even in the face of very strong evidence suggesting otherwise."

**Quick Take**: Just because a decision feels right doesn't mean it is right. Always question gut feelings and seek evidence before acting.

### Loss Aversion: The $1 Million Mistake
Our natural tendency to avoid losses leads us to make systematically worse financial decisions. Through compelling examples (like choosing between guaranteed $45 vs. a 50% chance at $100), Tsipursky demonstrates how loss aversion costs professionals approximately 10% of their revenue annually—often wiping out 50% of their profits. The key insight is that we face "100,000 coin flips" throughout our careers, and consistently choosing the comfortable loss-avoiding option results in massive missed opportunities.

> "My life—anyone's life—is made of 100,000 coin flips. If we are trying to seize an opportunity, we can either win $5 million or $4.5 million."

**Quick Take**: Train yourself to see decisions as patterns rather than one-off choices. Calculate the long-term statistical advantage rather than seeking short-term comfort.

### The Eight-Step Decision-Making Model
Effective decision-making is a learnable process, not an innate talent. Tsipursky provides a systematic eight-step model that addresses most cognitive biases when applied consistently: identify decision needs, gather diverse perspectives, set clear goals, develop evaluation criteria, generate multiple options, weigh choices carefully, implement decisively, and evaluate results. This structured approach replaces dangerous intuition with reliable methodology.

> "It is tragic that business leaders consider making the best decisions as the key hallmark of business success, yet they treat the process of decision-making as something intuitive and almost magical."

**Quick Take**: Create a checklist of these eight steps and use it for all significant decisions. The process itself prevents most judgment errors.

### The Bias Blind Spot: Why Successful People Fail
The most dangerous cognitive bias is believing you're immune to bias—especially prevalent among successful professionals. When leaders succeed using gut instincts in previous contexts, they often continue relying on those same methods as they advance, even though their effectiveness diminishes with increased responsibility and changing environments. This helps explain why many high-flying executives ultimately fail spectacularly.

> "After all, they have succeeded so far! Unfortunately, the greatest disasters happen to those who have been most successful, usually because they continue to use methods that worked for them in the past in new contexts where their previous methods no longer apply."

**Quick Take**: Success increases vulnerability to bias. Regularly seek feedback from those who disagree with you, especially when you're feeling confident about your decisions.

### The Five Questions That Prevent Disasters
When under pressure to decide quickly, ask these five critical questions: What important information haven't I considered? What judgment errors might be affecting me? What would an objective advisor suggest? How could this decision fail? What new information would cause me to reconsider? These questions activate your analytical thinking system and counteract dangerous gut reactions.

> "What feels comfortable is often exactly the wrong thing for our bottom line. In our technologically disrupted environment, the future is never going to be like today."

**Quick Take**: Write these five questions on a card or note and review them before making any important decision, especially under pressure.
