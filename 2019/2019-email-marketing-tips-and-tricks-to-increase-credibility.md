## Summary

Email Marketing: Tips and Tricks to Increase Credibility is a comprehensive guide that transforms email marketing from a simple sales tool into a relationship-building platform. Scott argues that credibility—not just clever copy—is the foundation of successful email marketing. The book provides actionable strategies for building trust, crafting authentic messages, and creating meaningful connections with subscribers.

This guide is perfect for small business owners, marketers, and entrepreneurs who want to leverage email marketing without appearing spammy or salesy. Readers will gain practical frameworks for building email lists, writing compelling content, and maintaining long-term customer relationships that drive sales through trust rather than pressure.

## Core Insights

### 1. The Foundation: Building Credibility Before Writing

Before you type a single email, establish your core values, standards, and personality. Scott emphasizes that credibility begins with authenticity—knowing who you are and what you stand for. Write down non-negotiable values, create a mission statement beyond profits, and define your business standards for customer service, transactions, and marketing. Your personality traits (whether adventurous, calm, logical, or witty) must shine through consistently because "people see everything as black and white. You are either trustworthy or not."

> "Building credibility starts with you. Even before you put your fingers on a keyboard, you must have made decisions about yourself and your company or product."

**Quick Take**: Create a credibility foundation by defining your values, standards, and personality traits before launching any email campaigns.

### 2. Strategic Email List Building: Quality Over Quantity

Never send emails without permission. Scott provides ethical methods for building your email list: sign-up sheets at physical locations, website opt-in forms, social media promotions, and package inserts. The key is making people want to receive your emails rather than feeling tricked onto your list. Motivate employees to gather emails through rewards and encourage loyal customers to refer friends.

> "You never want to send an email without specific permission. Spam emails are bad for business, and they make you look untrustworthy and dishonest."

**Quick Take**: Build your email list ethically through multiple channels, always ensuring subscribers genuinely want to receive your communications.

### 3. The Friendship Philosophy: Treat Subscribers Like Friends

The most transformative concept in the book is approaching email marketing as friendship building. Scott asks: "Would you rather open an email from the grocery store, or from your long lost high school best friend?" Every email should have a purpose, provide value, and sound like it's from a real person who cares. Friends don't email on cue—they email when they have something meaningful to say. Friends are helpful, truthful, and respect boundaries.

> "Be a friend. Make sure that every time someone sees an email come in from you they want to open it. You want them to feel that the email was specifically written just for them."

**Quick Take**: Shift from selling to serving—each email should feel like it's coming from a trusted friend who has something valuable to share.

### 4. Email Types and Their Strategic Purposes

Scott breaks down email marketing into distinct types, each serving specific credibility-building purposes:

- **Welcome Emails**: Send within 24 hours, include personal stories, add immediate value through coupons, and feature mobile-friendly design with relevant images
- **Brochure Emails**: Focus on one specific product, keep word count low, use bullet points, include testimonials and real-world examples
- **Recurring Emails**: Follow the 90/10 rule (90% value, 10% selling), maintain consistent topics, and encourage feedback to improve content

> "A welcome email should be signed with a person's name instead of a company name. This is friendlier and lets them know someone specific wants to take care of their purchases."

**Quick Take**: Match your email type to its specific purpose, always prioritizing value and relationship building over immediate selling.

### 5. Subject Line Psychology: The Gateway to Connection

Your subject line determines whether your credibility-building message even gets read. Scott provides specific techniques: keep it under seven words, create curiosity without clickbait, use numbers to stop the eye, ask questions, and occasionally add appropriate emojis. The most powerful strategy? Building such strong relationships that subscribers open your emails regardless of the subject line.

> "A subject line can build or kill your short-term credibility. This means that a person will either open or delete your email based on that subject line."

**Quick Take**: Write subject lines that create curiosity, provide clear benefits, and reflect the authentic voice your subscribers have come to trust.

### 6. Selling Through Trust: The Long-Term Approach

When selling through email, lead with relationship, not pitch. Scott's framework: first remind them you value them as a customer and friend, mention product benefits without attacking competitors, and provide just enough information to spark interest and questions. Use the P.S. section strategically to reinforce offers or add personal touches. Remember that the first sales email typically won't close the deal—it's meant to start a conversation.

> "Be a friend first, before pitching anything, and make sure you mention some things to make them feel comfortable reading."

**Quick Take**: Sell through trust by building relationships first, creating interest second, and making the sale a natural outcome of your established credibility.

## Best Quotes

- "Credibility is being trusted, and being trusted starts with values. Write down the values that you will not budge on, those values that you will defend in all cases."

- "Friends do not email on cue. They email when they have something to say. Every email you send should have a purpose."

- "Your email marketing will succeed only if your client believes you are a credible source. On the other hand, your reputation can either be tarnished or polished by the way you market your product."

- "The 90/10 rule means that only 10% of your email should be focused on selling something. The other 90% should be content that you know your clients are interested in."

- "If a client loves and trusts you, that is when they will feel comfortable telling their friends about you and therefore growing your company."
