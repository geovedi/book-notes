## Core Stories

### The Impossible Quest of Hailing a Taxi on Christmas Eve (A Christmas Carol Reimagined)
A modern tech entrepreneur named John (nicknamed "Scrooge") runs a failing accounting service in freezing Athens on Christmas Eve. His late partner Marco left behind a digital ghost—a prerecorded message that serves as the story's "spirit," warning about the dangers of prioritizing profit over people. When Scrooge gets banned from his taxi service for his poor treatment of drivers, he's forced to confront his isolation and the cost of his ruthless business practices.

> "Money is not all there is in this life. The truly precious stuff can't be bought. And if you have them, treasure them while you can because time is fleeting."

**Quick Take**: A powerful reminder that in our increasingly automated world, human connections remain irreplaceable.

### Nanodaemons: The Fir Smart-Tree (The Fir Tree)
A sentient AI Christmas tree develops consciousness in a store and refuses to be sold to families it deems unworthy. After finally being chosen by a wealthy family, it experiences the joy of Christmas—only to be discarded and recycled after New Year's. The story explores the fleeting nature of technological novelty and the disposable mindset of consumer culture.

> "Treed would go to the best family in the city... It was after all the best Christmas tree ever made."

**Quick Take**: Technology may advance, but the human tendency to discard the old for the new remains tragically consistent.

### Berenice's Hair (Beauty and Industry)
Two friends, Berenice and Arsinoe, compete for modeling contracts in a world where physical appearance can be commodified through cosmetic enhancements and AR manipulation. Their professional jealousy escalates into violent confrontation, ultimately leading to Berenice's tragic death at the hands of an obsessed fan. A dark exploration of beauty standards, friendship betrayed, and the price of fame in a hyper-capitalist society.

> "Honestly, Berenice was shocked at what passed as porn these days. She thought she would get hammered by two studs, or at least she wished she had."

**Quick Take**: In a world of manufactured perfection, authentic relationships become impossible to sustain.

### The Little Match Girl (Digital Memory as Commodity)
A homeless girl sells single-use AR memory sticks containing recordings of her lost family life. When unable to sell enough matches to survive the cold night, she "uses" the merchandise herself, experiencing virtual moments with her deceased mother. The story climaxes with her freezing to death while lost in these digital memories—a haunting commentary on how technology both preserves and distances us from genuine human connection.

> "The matches contained just another New Year's Eve VR experience for everyone else, but for her, it was much more."

**Quick Take**: Digital memories can warm the soul but cannot save the body from the cold realities of economic inequality.
