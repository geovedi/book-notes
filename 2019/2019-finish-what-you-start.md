# Finish What You Start
**Authors**: Peter Hollins | **Year**: 2019

## Summary
"Finish What You Start" is a practical guide to overcoming the universal struggle of following through on goals and intentions. The book addresses why we abandon projects at the first sign of difficulty and provides concrete strategies for building the self-discipline needed to complete what we start.

This book is perfect for anyone who struggles with procrastination, has abandoned half-finished projects, or wants to transform their intentions into reality. Readers will gain actionable frameworks for building lasting follow-through habits and creating systems that make completion inevitable rather than optional.

## Core Insights

### The Four Pillars of Follow-Through
Following through isn't a single skill but a combination of four essential elements: focus, self-discipline, action, and persistence. Focus directs your attention, self-discipline keeps you upright when you want to slump, action initiates progress, and persistence carries you through roadblocks. Together, they form what the author calls the "super-robot" of achievement.

> "As the head is continuous with the spine, so is focus continuous with self-discipline. If you are focused on what you need to do, self-discipline will naturally follow."

**Quick Take**: Success isn't about finding motivation—it's about building systems that make follow-through automatic.

### Understanding Your Roadblocks
We fail to finish what we start for two main reasons: inhibiting tactics (poor planning, bad goals, procrastination, time mismanagement) and psychological roadblocks (fear of failure, perfectionism, lack of self-awareness). Understanding which type of blockage you're facing is crucial to choosing the right solution.

> "Too often, we'll say we'll do something, and we might even start it one lucky weekend. But at the first sign of hardship, fatigue, boredom, or busyness, we abandon it all too easily."

**Quick Take**: Identify whether you're sabotaging yourself through poor planning or psychological protection before choosing your strategy.

### Create Your Personal Manifesto
A manifesto is a set of daily rules that eliminates guesswork and creates clear guidelines for action. The book suggests six key rules: act only when it aligns with your desired character, focus on three major tasks maximum, set daily limitations and requirements, reaffirm intentions with "I want/will/won't" statements, consider your future self, and use the "just 10 minutes" principle for both starting and stopping.

> "A manifesto is nothing more than a set of rules to follow every day. We might hate rules, but rules take the guesswork out of our days and give us guidelines to follow."

**Quick Take**: Create black-and-white rules that leave no room for negotiation with your undisciplined self.

### Master Internal and External Motivation
Sustainable motivation comes from two sources: external motivators (accountability partners, financial stakes, social pressure) and internal motivators (personal growth, life improvement, core values). The key is making motivation visible and multi-sensory so it stays top of mind. Regularly refresh your motivational cues to prevent habituation.

> "Motivation has been shown to work best when we are reminded of it—otherwise, out of sight, out of mind."

**Quick Take**: Make your motivations impossible to ignore by engaging all five senses and rotating them regularly.
