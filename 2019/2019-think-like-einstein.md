# Think Like Einstein
**Author**: Peter Hollins | **Year**: 2019
**Category**: Philosophy & Critical Thinking

## Summary
"Think Like Einstein" is a practical guide to developing better thinking skills, improving problem-solving abilities, and sharpening judgment. The book argues that despite our formal education, most people are never taught how to think effectively - only how to pass tests and regurgitate information. Hollins provides scientifically proven methods and frameworks to help readers think more clearly, make better decisions, and approach problems creatively like Einstein did.

This book is perfect for anyone who wants to improve their critical thinking skills, make fewer mistakes in decision-making, and develop a more logical approach to life's challenges. Readers will learn practical techniques for creative problem-solving, understand different types of intelligence, and discover how to use thought experiments to break through mental barriers.

## Core Insights

### Frameworks for Better Thinking
The book presents three established models of critical thinking that provide structured approaches to analyzing problems:

**The Facione Model** outlines six essential skills: Interpretation (understanding and communicating information), Analysis (determining meaning from data), Inference (reading between lines and making educated guesses), Evaluation (assessing credibility and relevance), Explanation (articulating your reasoning), and Self-regulation (thinking about your own thinking).

**The RED Model** focuses on three core actions: Recognizing assumptions, Evaluating arguments, and Drawing conclusions. This framework helps you systematically break down complex problems into manageable components.

**The Paul-Elder Model** emphasizes the relationship between thought, language, and feelings, encouraging thinkers to analyze problems from multiple intellectual perspectives.

> "Thinking clearly and effectively is far harder than we think, even after gaining awareness and knowledge because of the ingrained ways we are programmed to perceive things."

**Quick Take**: Use these frameworks as mental checklists when approaching complex problems - they ensure you're considering all angles rather than jumping to conclusions.

### Creative Problem-Solving Techniques
The key to creative problem-solving isn't about sudden genius moments but about making connections between unrelated concepts and understanding underlying principles. One powerful technique is changing how you describe the problem - often you're trying to solve the wrong question entirely.

To find the essence of a problem, ask yourself what you're truly trying to accomplish. For example, if you want to buy a car but can't afford one, the real problem is transportation, which might be solved with a scooter or bicycle instead. This reframing opens up entirely new solution pathways.

Another approach is to look for similar solutions in unrelated fields. Whatever problem you're facing, someone somewhere has likely solved something similar. Studying their approaches can inspire solutions you hadn't considered.

> "If you want to leave a room and the door is locked, you wouldn't keep trying the door. You would start looking at the window, the vents, or even the floor if you fancy a dig. The question began as, 'How can I open this door?' and changed to, 'How can I leave the room in any manner?'"

**Quick Take**: Always question whether you're solving the right problem - the essence of your goal might be completely different from your initial framing.

### Understanding Multiple Intelligence Types
The book challenges the traditional view of intelligence as being purely academic, presenting Howard Gardner's eight types of intelligence: linguistic/verbal, logical-mathematical, visual-spatial, body-movement, musical, interpersonal, intrapersonal, and naturalist.

Traditional education primarily values linguistic and logical-mathematical intelligence, but real-world success often depends on other types. Understanding your natural intelligence strengths helps you leverage them rather than feeling inadequate about areas where you don't excel.

> "It's impossible and inaccurate to reduce three dimensional people down to a single number. It's an imperfect way of measuring worth, and this is the chapter to demonstrate exactly that."

**Quick Take**: Identify your strongest intelligence types and find ways to apply them to your problems - your athletic intelligence might help solve business problems through strategic thinking, for example.

### The Power of Thought Experiments
One of Einstein's greatest thinking tools was the "gedankenexperiment" (thought experiment) - playing out "what if" scenarios to their logical conclusions. This technique allows you to analyze premises and ideas that can't be tested in reality.

A famous example is Einstein imagining what would happen if he caught up to and rode a beam of light. This simple thought experiment led him to realize that time couldn't be constant, directly laying the foundation for relativity theory.

Thought experiments allow you to challenge fundamental assumptions, explore impossible scenarios safely, and discover logical inconsistencies in current models. They're particularly valuable when you're stuck on a problem that seems to have no solution within conventional thinking.

> "Sometimes, geniuses really do think differently. Einstein in particular was known to think differently in one main way. He was never in the habit of writing down or verbalizing his thinking process, the major part of which was what he called gedankenexperiments, which is German for 'thought experiment.'"

**Quick Take**: Regularly ask yourself "what if" questions about fundamental assumptions in your field or problems - you might discover breakthrough insights.

### Overcoming Obstacles to Clear Thinking
The book identifies four main obstacles to clear thinking: Inertia and Sloth (mental laziness), Incorrect Logic (flawed reasoning), Incorrect Perception (seeing things inaccurately), and Rigid Thinking (inability to adapt perspectives).

Most people underestimate how much their thinking is influenced by ingrained habits and evolutionary programming. We're naturally lazy thinkers who prefer emotional responses over careful analysis. Recognizing these tendencies is the first step to overcoming them.

Clear thinking requires conscious effort and the use of structured approaches to counteract our natural mental shortcuts and biases. It's not about eliminating emotions from decisions, but about recognizing when emotion is driving your thinking versus when it's providing valuable input.

> "Cultivating critical thought is always the toughest thing to do because you are fighting years of instinct and evolution that have told you to rely on your gut emotion."

**Quick Take**: Treat your first thoughts as suggestions rather than conclusions - always challenge your initial responses to ensure they're based on sound reasoning.

## Best Quotes

- "Despite all of our schooling, we are never taught how to actually think. We're taught how to pass classes and regurgitate knowledge to pass tests, but when it comes to thinking for ourselves?"
- "There are scientifically proven ways to think better. You might not write a theorem to disprove Einstein's theory of general relativity, but you will make fewer mistakes, make better decisions, and overall be smarter about what you choose to believe."
- "Most creative problem solving isn't really about uncovering something new or learning something. It doesn't require a stroke of genius or sudden epiphany that only few people are capable of."
- "You've read just the kind of difference training your brain can make in the kind of results you have, and ways you can avoid deception whether intentional or not."
- "Sharpening your insight isn't just about being more observant or solving logic riddles. That might be where it starts, but it can have a very real positive effect on your life."

## Action Items

- Practice redefining your problems by asking "What's the real essence of what I'm trying to accomplish?"
- Use the Facione Model (Interpretation, Analysis, Inference, Evaluation, Explanation, Self-regulation) as a checklist when analyzing complex decisions
- Identify your strongest intelligence types and find ways to leverage them in your problem-solving
- Regularly conduct thought experiments by asking "What if [fundamental assumption] weren't true?"
- Challenge your first conclusions - always ask "What if I'm wrong about this?"

## Questions to Consider

- What assumptions am I making about my current biggest problem that might not be true?
- Which type of intelligence comes most naturally to me, and how can I apply it more broadly?
- How often do I question whether I'm solving the right problem, rather than just the obvious one?
- What "impossible" scenarios could I explore through thought experiments to gain new insights?
- Which thinking obstacles (inertia, incorrect logic, incorrect perception, rigid thinking) affect me most?

## Conclusion
"Think Like Einstein" is definitely worth your time if you're looking for practical, actionable ways to improve your thinking skills. The biggest reason to read this book is that it provides specific frameworks and techniques rather than vague advice about "thinking better." While it won't magically transform you into Einstein, it will give you concrete tools to approach problems more systematically and creatively.

The book's strength lies in its balance of scientific research and practical application. Hollins doesn't just tell you to think better - he shows you exactly how with specific models, examples, and exercises. The techniques are immediately applicable to both personal and professional challenges, making this a valuable reference book you'll likely return to when facing particularly difficult problems.
