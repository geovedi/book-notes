# The Art of Consultancy
**Authors**: Calvert Markham | **Year**: 2019

## Summary
"The Art of Consultancy" delivers a practical framework for management consultants at all levels, from newcomers to seasoned practitioners. This seventh edition presents consulting as both a science and an art—combining systematic processes with the nuanced skills of relationship building and influencing. The book's core premise is that consultancy is fundamentally about delivering specialist skills within a client environment, where success hinges on the consultant's ability to add value through structured projects while maintaining professional credibility and ethical standards.

The book is essential reading for management consultants, internal consultants, managers who need consulting skills, and executives who hire consultants. Readers will gain a comprehensive understanding of the consultancy delivery process, from initial client contact through project completion, along with the critical soft skills that separate successful consultants from merely knowledgeable experts.

## Core Insights

### The Five-Stage Delivery Process
Consultancy projects follow a systematic five-phase process that provides structure while allowing flexibility. The process begins with **Entry**, where first impressions matter immensely—consultants must look and act the part, as research shows initial impact depends primarily on appearance and sound, not content. This phase involves understanding client culture, building rapport, and establishing professional credibility. **Contracting** follows, where clear terms of reference are established—defining scope and deliverables while managing expectations on both sides. The **Diagnosis** phase involves systematic problem-solving and data collection to understand the client's situation thoroughly. **Intervention** is where consultants work with clients to implement solutions, recognizing that "recommendations are conclusions adjusted for the process of change." Finally, **Closure** ensures proper project completion while maintaining relationships for future work.

> "The purpose of the consultancy delivery process is to enable the consultant to add value to the client."

**Quick Take**: Success requires balancing systematic process with the flexibility to adapt to client needs and organizational culture.

### The Consultant Identity Crisis and Professional Presence
New consultants typically face an identity crisis—questioning their worth, knowledge, and ability to handle client challenges. The book emphasizes that consultants must master professional presence through appearance, behavior, and communication. Visual impact matters: grooming rules are fundamental, dress should match client expectations (when in doubt, err on formality), and body language should project confidence even when feeling uncertain. Professional behavior means acting in the client's interest, maintaining high work rates, keeping appropriate hours, and bringing excellence to all interactions. Remember that you're always representing your firm, and first-class operating becomes your best sales tool.

> "We know from everyday life that we are inclined to take people at their own valuation. People are influenced not only by authority but also by the appearance of authority."

**Quick Take**: Your professional presence precedes your expertise—invest in image and behavior as much as technical knowledge.

### The Role Continuum: Finding Your Consulting Style
Consultants operate on a continuum from client-centered to consultant-centered behaviors. Client-centered approaches leverage the client's experience and knowledge, with consultants acting as facilitators who enable organizational self-help. Consultant-centered approaches rely more heavily on the consultant's direct expertise and analysis. The appropriate role depends on factors including client capability, time constraints, organizational culture, and the nature of the problem. Effective consultants regularly assess their position on this continuum and adapt their approach based on project needs rather than defaulting to their comfort zone.

> "Consultancy projects are joint efforts between consultant and client, and consultants should vary their role according to the circumstances to get the best results."

**Quick Take**: Flexibility in your consulting approach is crucial—match your style to the client's needs and capabilities, not your preferences.

### The Outsider Advantage: Perspective and Adaptation
By definition, consultants bring valuable external perspective free from organizational legacy thinking and historical baggage. However, this perspective diminishes over time as consultants "go native"—adopting client assumptions and mindset. Successful consultants balance maintaining objective perspective with adopting "protective coloration" that allows them to integrate effectively into client organizations. This includes learning organizational language, understanding cultural norms, and quickly adapting to working styles. The challenge is becoming familiar enough to be effective without losing the valuable outsider perspective that clients are paying for.

> "Organisations are like the human body—they may have the equivalent of an immune reaction to outsiders. Consultants have to get to know clients pretty quickly."

**Quick Take**: Maintain your outsider perspective while learning to navigate client culture—it's the unique value you bring.

### Knowledge Management and Continuous Learning
Consultancy is fundamentally a knowledge-based business where individual project experiences contribute to collective organizational wisdom. Effective review processes are crucial for extracting lessons from projects and making them available across the practice. This systematic knowledge management enables consultancy practices to grow their value to both individual consultants and clients. The book emphasizes that getting knowledge out of individual consultants' heads and making it corporately available requires specific effort and processes, but represents the real means by which consulting practices build sustainable competitive advantage.

> "Review is the means by which this is done, but it is often not done or not done well. Getting the knowledge out of the heads of individual consultants and making it corporately available needs specific effort."

**Quick Take**: Systematically capture and share project learnings—your practice's collective knowledge becomes your greatest competitive asset.
