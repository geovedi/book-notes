# The Near Witch
**Authors**: V.E. Schwab | **Year**: 2019
**Category**: Fantasy & Science Fiction

## Summary
In the isolated village of Near, where no strangers ever come and everyone knows everyone, six-year-old Lexi's father tells her bedtime stories about the Near Witch—a legendary figure who once lived on the edge of the village and could sing the hills to sleep. Years later, when Lexi is sixteen, children begin disappearing from their beds, and a mysterious stranger named Cole arrives in town, bringing with him winds that seem to carry strange melodies.

As fear grips the village and suspicion falls on the newcomer, Lexi discovers that the Near Witch is more than just a story. The children aren't just missing—they're being called away by an ancient magic tied to the village's forgotten past. With the help of Cole (who has his own magical abilities), Lexi must unravel the truth behind the nursery rhyme that has haunted Near for generations and confront the real source of the disappearances before her own little sister Wren becomes the next victim.

This dark fantasy blends folklore, coming-of-age themes, and small-town suspicion into a haunting tale about fear of outsiders, the power of stories, and the courage to challenge what everyone believes to be true.

## Core Insights

### The Legend of the Near Witch
The Near Witch was once real, a woman who lived on the edge of Near and had a special connection to children, performing small magical tricks for them like making flowers bloom instantly. But when a little boy visited her and didn't return home, the villagers turned against her, believing she had harmed the child. The truth was more complicated—the boy had actually died in an accident, but the villagers' fear transformed the Near Witch from a gentle magic-worker into a monster in their stories.

> "Long, long ago, the Near Witch lived in a small house on the farthest edge of the village, and she used to sing the hills to sleep."
**Quick Take**: Stories change based on our fears, turning truths into monsters that serve our need for explanations.

### Small-Town Suspicion and the Outsider
The village of Near operates on strict insider/outsider dynamics. When Cole arrives as the first stranger in memory, the immediately becomes the scapegoat for the children's disappearances. The villagers' fear of the unknown makes them blind to the real threat, showing how communities often blame newcomers rather than examining their own buried secrets.

> "There are no strangers in the town of Near. I have seen every face a thousand times. But not this one."
**Quick Take**: Fear of the unknown often makes us miss the real dangers hiding in plain sight.

### The Power of Rhymes and Stories
The children's game and "Witch's Rhyme" that they sing isn't just playground entertainment—it's a piece of magic that keeps the Near Witch's memory alive and gives her power. The rhyme acts as a summoning spell, showing how stories and songs can have real-world effects beyond mere entertainment.

> "Near Witch, Moor Witch, now no more"
**Quick Take**: The stories we tell don't just reflect reality—they can shape it in unexpected ways.

### Wind Magic and Connection
Both Lexi and Cole can influence the wind, representing a deeper connection to the magical elements of their world. This ability becomes crucial in understanding and ultimately defeating the Near Witch. The wind serves as both a metaphor for change and a literal force that can be directed by those who understand its nature.

**Quick Take**: Understanding natural forces gives us power to face supernatural threats.

### Courage to Question Authority
Lexi's character arc shows growth from someone who accepts the village's rules to someone willing to challenge them, even when it puts her at odds with her uncle Otto (the village Protector) and the Council. Her journey demonstrates that true protection sometimes means breaking the rules rather than following them.

**Quick Take**: Real bravery often means questioning what everyone else accepts without question.

## Conclusion
*The Near Witch* is a beautifully crafted dark fantasy that works on multiple levels—as a coming-of-age story, a mystery, and an exploration of how fear shapes communities. Schwab's prose is atmospheric and haunting, perfectly capturing the isolated feel of a small town where everyone knows each other but no one really understands the darkness in their own past.

The book succeeds best when it focuses on Lexi's journey from curious villager to courageous truth-seeker, and her developing relationship with Cole provides emotional depth without overwhelming the main plot. The magical elements are woven naturally into the story, feeling both wondrous and dangerous.

Is this worth your time? Absolutely, especially if you enjoy atmospheric fantasy that balances supernatural elements with very human themes of prejudice, fear, and courage. The biggest reason to read it is Schwab's masterful ability to create a world that feels both magical and psychologically real, where the real monsters aren't always the ones in the stories.
