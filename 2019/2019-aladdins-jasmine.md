**Authors**: A. Anders | **Year**: 2019

## Summary
"Aladdin's Jasmine" is a provocative MMF bisexual romance retelling of the classic Aladdin fairy tale. This reimagining explores Princess Jasmine's desperate escape from her gilded palace cage, her encounter with the street-smart Aladdin, and their complicated relationship with the magical Genie. Unlike the Disney version, this story explores adult themes of sexual awakening, bisexual desire, and polyamorous relationships through a contemporary lens while maintaining the core elements of the beloved tale.

The story will appeal to readers who enjoy fairy tale retellings with explicit romantic content, those interested in LGBTQ+ romance with a fantasy setting, and fans of stories that challenge traditional relationship norms. Readers can expect a steamy exploration of desire, freedom, and unconventional love that pushes boundaries while delivering emotional depth.

## Core Insights

### Freedom vs. Security
Jasmine's struggle represents the universal conflict between the safety of tradition and the exhilaration of freedom. Her palace life, though luxurious, is essentially a beautifully decorated prison where every movement is controlled and every choice is made for her. This mirrors modern questions about whether we trade authentic self-expression for societal approval and material comfort.

> "Everything about her life felt that way. But worse than all of that. Worse than the fact that every moment of her life was maneuvered like a stringed puppet, was the rule that governed every princess in her line. It was that no one, not her guards, not her instructors, not even visiting emissaries, was allowed to look her in the eyes."

**Quick Take**: True freedom requires courage to leave behind comfortable prisons, even when the alternative is uncertain and frightening.

### Power Dynamics and Desire
The story explores how power imbalances shape relationships and desire. Jasmine's position as princess simultaneously grants her privilege while denying her agency, creating a complex dynamic where her rebellion becomes an act of reclaiming power over her own body and choices.

**Quick Take**: Desire is intrinsically linked to agency - we cannot genuinely want what we cannot freely choose.

### Found Family and Chosen Bonds
The trio relationship that develops between Jasmine, Aladdin, and the Genie suggests that family isn't determined by blood or status but by mutual understanding, support, and genuine connection. This challenges traditional fairy tale narratives that focus solely on heterosexual monogamous relationships.

**Quick Take**: Real family consists of those who see and accept us for who we truly are, not who society expects us to be.

## Best Quotes

- "Jasmine's heart ached to be seen by another human being. She wanted it so desperately that she had considered climbing to the top of the palace wall and throwing herself off of it. She would be seen then, the whole city would see her."

- "Everything around her seemed more alive. Was it because this was the last time she would see all of it? Perhaps. But, with a final deep breath and all of the courage she could gather, she turned the knob of her bedroom door and stepped out into the hall."

- "Do you think those are my people outside the palace walls? No. They are their own. We live here like this as long as we can convince them that this is our natural place. If we let go of that illusion for a second, they will see the lie we've presented and destroy us all."

## Key Themes

- **Sexual Awakening**: Jasmine's journey from sheltered princess to sexually autonomous woman

## Questions to Consider

2. Can true freedom be found within existing power structures, or must they be completely dismantled?
3. How does fairy tale romance literature both reflect and challenge real-world relationship norms?
4. What role does fantasy and imagination play in helping us envision alternatives to traditional relationships?
5. How do the magical elements in fairy tale retellings help us explore complex emotional truths?

## Conclusion

"Aladdin's Jasmine" offers readers an unapologetically adult take on a beloved fairy tale, using the familiar framework to explore contemporary themes of sexual freedom, relationship diversity, and personal empowerment. While the explicit content may not appeal to all readers, those seeking romance that challenges conventional norms will find this retelling both titillating and thought-provoking.

The book's greatest strength lies in its willingness to push boundaries and imagine a world where love and desire aren't constrained by traditional expectations. By reimagining classic characters as sexually autonomous adults exploring non-traditional relationships, it opens up space for readers to question their own assumptions about love, commitment, and personal freedom.

This is recommended for readers who enjoy steamy romance, LGBTQ+ themes, and fairy tale retellings that aren't afraid to venture into adult territory. The combination of familiar fantasy elements with explicit bisexual romance creates a unique reading experience that's both entertaining and surprisingly emotionally resonant.
