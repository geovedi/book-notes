# Psychological Triggers: The Hidden Influences Behind Our Actions, Thoughts, and Behaviors
**Author**: Peter Hollins | **Year**: 2019
**Category**: Psychology & Mental Health

## Summary
"Psychological Triggers" explores the hidden forces that drive human behavior, revealing how much of our decision-making is governed by unconscious impulses rather than rational choice. Hollins argues that free will is largely an illusion, as we're constantly influenced by evolutionary programming, social pressure, emotional states, biological drives, and cognitive shortcuts.

The book is essential reading for anyone who wants to understand why they make decisions against their own best interests, how to recognize psychological triggers in daily life, and practical strategies for making more rational choices in an irrational world.

## Core Insights

### The Illusion of Free Will
We believe we make rational decisions, but most choices are actually responses to psychological triggers programmed into us through evolution. The famous Fyre Festival disaster demonstrates how psychological triggers override logic—when organizers said "Let's just do it and be legends," their ego and ambition triggered a catastrophic decision-making cascade.

> "We don't have true free will. Instead, we are composites of psychological triggers that dictate our decisions and regulate our emotions."

**Quick Take**: Your decisions are less "you" than you think. Recognition of this fact is the first step toward better decision-making.

### Evolutionary Hangovers
Our brains evolved for survival, not modern life. Phobias illustrate this perfectly: we fear spiders and snakes (killing ~11 Americans yearly) but not cars (killing ~37,500 Americans yearly). This is because spiders and snakes threatened our ancestors for millennia, while cars are evolutionarily new.

> "It's possible our fear of those critters is so enmeshed in our biological chemistry that it may be many more millennia before evolution processes it out."

**Quick Take**: Your fears and impulses often reflect ancient survival needs rather than present-day realities.

### The 12-Second Window
The amygdala creates a 12-second "occipital spike" of emotional arousal that can override rational thinking. During this window, you can choose calming techniques (deep breathing, counting, mantras) to let the spike pass without acting on it.

> "The amygdala has a very short window of opportunity to wreak havoc—about 12 seconds, to be more exact."

**Quick Take**: Count to 12 (and breathe) before acting on strong emotions—it's biological, not just good advice.

### Social Conformity Pressure
Social influence is one of the most powerful psychological triggers. The Asch conformity experiments showed people will give obviously wrong answers to fit in with a group. We're wired to conform because isolation meant death for our ancestors.

**Quick Take**: You're more influenced by your social environment than you realize. Actively questioning group consensus is rational, not anti-social.

### Emotional Hijacking
Paul Ekman identified six universal emotions (happiness, sadness, anger, disgust, fear, surprise) that can instantly hijack rational decision-making. When emotions take over, they become our reality, and we act to prolong positive feelings or immediately end negative ones.

**Quick Take**: Strong emotions are biological signals to act quickly, not accurately. Managing GABA through breathing can help maintain control.

### Mental Shortcuts That Mislead
Our brains use schemas (what's happening here) and heuristics (what should I do) as mental shortcuts. While efficient, they often lead to cognitive biases like loss aversion, simplicity preference, and contrast reliance—systematic errors in thinking.

**Quick Take**: Your brain's efficiency comes at the cost of accuracy. The Six Hats thinking method (multiple perspectives) can counteract this tendency.

### The Control Illusion
Humans seek control over random events through superstitions and rituals. Reactance theory shows that restricting someone's "freedom" triggers them to assert it—exactly like reverse psychology works with children.

**Quick Take**: Much of our behavior attempts to control the uncontrollable. Accepting uncertainty is healthier than fighting it.

## Best Quotes
- "More often than not, and certainly more than often than we would like to admit, they are dictating our actions."
- "We may not be as savage as that anymore (not all of us, anyway), but our brains still have that intuitive drive, even if we're swilling lattés instead of spearing woolly mammoths."
- "Psychological triggers may dictate your life, but at least we can learn to insulate ourselves against some of the more irrational and self-defeating impulses we all have."
- "We are slaves to our impulses—for most of us, this manifests in horribly negative ways."
- "Our impulses kept us alive in prior days but are wholly unsuited for the modern age."

## Action Items
- **Practice the 12-second rule**: When feeling triggered, pause and breathe for 12 seconds before acting
- **Become an interrogator**: Question sources, motives, and assumptions instead of accepting influences
- **Use "I don't" instead of "I can't"**: Frame refusals as identity statements rather than limitations
- **Apply the Six Hats method**: Analyze problems from multiple perspectives before deciding
- **Recognize evolutionary hangovers**: Question whether fears and impulses serve modern needs
- **Practice inoculation theory**: Expose yourself to opposing arguments in advance to build resistance

## Questions to Consider
- How often do you act against your own interests and what triggers those decisions?
- Which evolutionary fears no longer serve you in modern life?
- When has social pressure led you to make choices you later regretted?
- What rituals or superstitions reveal your need for control?
- How could recognizing your psychological triggers change your decision-making?

## Conclusion
"Psychological Triggers" is worth your time if you've ever wondered why you make decisions that seem to go against your own best interests. Hollins reveals that much of our behavior is driven by unconscious programming rather than conscious choice. The biggest reason to read it is the empowerment that comes from understanding these triggers—while you may not eliminate them, recognition alone can dramatically improve your decision-making quality. The book serves as both a fascinating exploration of human psychology and a practical guide to navigating the hidden influences that shape our lives.
