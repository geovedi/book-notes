# Smashing It: Working-Class Artists Making It Happen
**Editors**: Sabrina Mahfouz | **Year**: 2019
**Category**: Art & Creativity

## Summary
"Smashing It" is a powerful anthology that amplifies the voices of working-class artists across the UK creative industries. Conceived after editor Sabrina Mahfouz noticed that interviewers consistently asked about her gender and ethnicity barriers but never about class obstacles, this book combines personal essays, artistic works, and practical guidance to address the severe underrepresentation of working-class people in the arts.

The book reveals shocking statistics: only 12.6% of publishing professionals, 12.4% of film/TV/radio workers, and 18.2% of music/performing/visual arts professionals come from working-class backgrounds—despite this group representing approximately a third of the UK population. Through raw, honest contributions from established and emerging artists, it explores the intersection of class with race, gender, sexuality, and other identity factors, while providing actionable guidance for navigating an industry often structured to exclude those without financial safety nets or cultural connections.

This book is essential for working-class artists seeking validation and practical strategies, arts industry professionals wanting to understand barriers they may not see, and anyone interested in how social mobility has stagnated while creative industries become increasingly exclusive. It offers both catharsis for those who've felt like imposters and a blueprint for systemic change.

## Core Insights

### The Invisible Barrier: Why Class Matters More Than Ever

Class operates as the most confusing yet significant identity marker in the arts. While diversity initiatives focus on gender and ethnicity, class remains the taboo topic—despite being the primary obstacle for many. As Mahfouz discovered when 600 people signed up for her first arts funding workshop, working-class artists don't feel supported because the industry systematically fails to recognize their barriers.

The statistics are damning: social mobility has been "virtually stagnant" from 2014-2019, and working-class people are dramatically underrepresented across all creative sectors. This isn't about merit—it's about a system designed by and for those with cultural capital, family connections, and financial safety nets.

> "Social class is a confusing identity marker. Every person I have ever spoken to about it has their own beliefs about how it should be defined."

**Quick Take**: Class barriers operate invisibly but impact everything from networking opportunities to the ability to work unpaid internships. Recognizing this is the first step toward dismantling it.

### The Ten Crack Commandments: Survival Strategies for Working-Class Artists

Madani Younis, Artistic Director of Europe's largest arts venue (London's Southbank Centre), offers ten powerful principles for navigating systemic privilege. These commandments serve as both protective armor and offensive strategy for artists fighting to maintain their authentic voice while breaking into exclusive spaces.

The commandments include fundamental truths like "If they tell you you shouldn't, you really should" and "When they tell you that class doesn't matter, tell them that it has never mattered more." Perhaps most powerfully: "Say to yourself every night, 'I am surrounded by love and I am the hero of my own story'" and "If they tell you that you can't, it's because they never could. It was always meant to be you."

> "10. If they tell you that you can't, it's because they never could. It was always meant to be you."

**Quick Take**: Your working-class background isn't a liability—it's your superpower. The system expects you to fail; exceeding those expectations becomes revolutionary.

### The Financial Reality: Art at Any Cost

The book brutally exposes the financial sacrifice required for working-class artists to succeed. Mahfouz shares how she took herself to the point of bankruptcy—£45,000 in debt over five years—to produce her first two Edinburgh Fringe shows. She worked cocktail waitressing night jobs and various day jobs while writing during breaks, living frugally with no car, shared housing, and zero savings.

This financial reality persists even after success. When Mahfouz became pregnant and couldn't work as much, she couldn't make ends meet and eventually filed for insolvency. The concept of savings "has never existed in my life, as working-class people with a love of travel and Moschino will understand."

> "I have only got to this point in my career because I was willing to take myself to the point of bankruptcy to get here. I am not AT ALL endorsing that anybody else do so."

**Quick Take**: Success shouldn't require financial ruin. The funding guidance in this book exists precisely to prevent others from facing these impossible choices.

### The Misfit Identity: Redefining Belonging

Michaela Coel's powerful contribution reclaims the term "misfit" as a badge of honor rather than shame. She defines misfits as those who "look at life differently" or are "made into misfits because life looks at them differently." This dual notion applies to anyone marginalized by the mainstream—whether through race, class, culture, or simply a desire for transparency and alternative perspectives.

Coel traces her journey from being the first black girl accepted into her drama school in five years to creating the groundbreaking series "Chewing Gum." She emphasizes how misfits share a common experience of being "judged and disempowered before they even spoke" yet finding strength in that shared identity to create authentic art.

> "The term Misfits can be cross-generational and crosses concepts of gender or culture, simply by a desire for transparency, a desire to see another's point of view. Synonyms; Outsider, Falcon."

**Quick Take**: Your outsider status gives you a unique vantage point that the mainstream desperately needs. Don't dilute your perspective to fit in—create work that speaks to other misfits who need to see themselves reflected.

### The Intersection Challenge: Class Meets Race, Gender, and Sexuality

Emma Dennis-Edwards' piece "Am I Working-Class, or Am I Just Black?" powerfully explores how intersecting identities complicate class discussions. She notes that growing up, "everyone I knew was black and everyone was working-class, to varying degrees." It wasn't until drama school that she became conscious of class as separate from race.

This intersectionality creates unique barriers. Working-class artists of color face compounded disadvantages, while working-class white artists may benefit from racial privilege. The book consistently reveals how class operates differently across different communities, yet universally creates barriers to arts access.

> "Before class, there's two very distinct markers about my identity that are slightly more significant in my personal experience; I am a woman and I am Black."

**Quick Take**: Your identity is intersectional—class doesn't exist in a vacuum. Understanding how different aspects of your identity interact helps navigate specific barriers and build broader solidarity.

## Practical Action Items

### Apply for Arts Funding: The Big Five Framework
1. **WHAT?** Clearly define your project type, themes, and practical implementation
2. **WHY?** Articulate why this art form, subject, and timing matters—why you're the right person
3. **HOW?** Detail your creative process, timeline, and specific activities requiring funding
4. **WHO?** Identify collaborators, target audience, and who will benefit from your work
5. **WHEN?** Create a realistic timeline with start dates, completion goals, and public sharing plans

### Budgeting Reality Check
- Research recommended minimum daily rates for your art form (Writer's Guild suggests £150+ per day)
- Include fees for all collaborators, travel costs, venue hire, and materials
- Plan for 10% matched funding through tickets sales, events, workshops, or crowdfunding
- Value in-kind support (free venue space, equipment loans, mentorship) at market rates
- Never apologize for asking to be paid fairly for your work—creative industries generate massive economic value

### Building Your Network Strategically
- Connect with Arts Council Relationship Managers in your region and art form
- Search online for "[your art form] + bursary + [your region]" to find niche funding opportunities
- Join organizations like Arts Emergency, Create London, and COMMON for working-class artist support
- Value in-kind support from contacts—everyone knows someone who can help with space, equipment, or expertise

## Questions to Consider

1. How has my class background shaped my artistic voice, and what unique perspectives does this give me?
2. What "cracks" in the arts system have I encountered that might be invisible to those from privileged backgrounds?
3. If I could create art without worrying about money or acceptance, what would I make?
4. Who are the "misfits" in my community, and how can my work speak to their experiences?
5. What would change in the arts if working-class people were proportionally represented at all levels?
6. How can I maintain my authentic voice while navigating spaces that expect conformity?
7. What practical support do I need, and what barriers prevent me from accessing it?

## Conclusion

"Smashing It" is both a battle cry and a practical guide for working-class artists determined to succeed in an industry that wasn't built for them. What makes this book essential reading is its raw honesty about the personal and financial costs of breaking into the arts without privilege, combined with concrete strategies for accessing funding and building sustainable careers.

The book's greatest strength is its dual nature—it validates the experiences of those who've felt like imposters while providing the tools and confidence needed to claim space in the arts. The stories of established artists like Malorie Blackman and Maureen Duffy alongside emerging voices like Travis Alabanza and Kerry Hudson create a powerful continuum, showing that while progress has been made, the fundamental barriers remain.

Is this book worth your time? Absolutely. Whether you're a working-class artist seeking validation and practical guidance, an arts professional wanting to understand systemic barriers, or someone interested in how social mobility has stagnated in creative industries, "Smashing It" offers insights you won't find elsewhere. The funding guide alone is worth the price—it demystifies a process deliberately made opaque, potentially saving artists thousands of pounds and countless hours of frustration.

The biggest reason to read this book is that it does exactly what its title promises: it shows you how to smash through barriers while staying true to your authentic voice. As Madani Younis reminds us in his tenth commandment: "If they tell you that you can't, it's because they never could. It was always meant to be you."
