## Fast-Track Story Guide

### The Rise and Fall
Shahin Gheiybe begins as the son of Ali Gheiybe, a successful Iranian boxer and air force pilot who immigrates to the Netherlands with his family. Shahin adapts quickly to Dutch life, excelling in school and discovering his talent for computer parts trading. What starts as upgrading his own computer spirals into a lucrative black market operation, making him wealthy beyond his wildest dreams. The money comes with dangers - robberies, threats, and increasingly risky decisions that ultimately lead him down a path toward violence and incarceration.

> "I used to count my cents when buying a can of Coca-Cola so I wouldn't be short at the cashier. But after I got into this business, I drove expensive cars and when buying clothes, I no longer looked at the price tag."

### The Night That Changed Everything
The pivotal moment occurs during a computer parts deal gone wrong. When his buyer H.K. arrives with a friend and a van instead of his usual car, Shahin senses danger. H.K. pulls a gun and attempts to rob Shahin at gunpoint, threatening his family. In the chaos that follows, Shahin manages to grab the weapon and shoots both men before fleeing the scene. This act of self-defense transforms him from a successful businessman into a fugitive, triggering a massive police operation and a nationwide manhunt.

### Life Behind Bars
Shahin's capture leads to a harrowing journey through the Dutch justice system. Despite initially cooperating with police, he soon realizes the system is stacked against him. His high-profile lawyer Bram Moszkowicz proves unreliable, and the court hands down a shocking 12-year sentence for attempted murder. In prison, Shahin experiences the dehumanizing conditions of solitary confinement, the complex social dynamics among inmates, and the crushing realization that he may spend years locked away for a crime he believes was self-defense.

### The Great Escape
The culmination of the narrative details Shahin's meticulously planned escape from prison. After a failed appeal increases his sentence to 13 years, he decides escape is his only option. Using ingenuity and determination, he fakes a knee injury during a football game, arranges transport to a hospital, and seizes a fleeting moment when guards are distracted to make his daring run for freedom. The subsequent manhunt becomes one of the largest in Dutch history, with helicopters, search dogs, and roadblocks deployed across the country.

> "This was my only chance. I had but 5 seconds to escape. I said to them 'I don't need these crutches anymore.' I gave one crutch to someone standing on my escape path and the other to the man next to him."
