Joseph Menn (2019)

***

The Cult of the Dead Cow (cDc) is a hacking group that has influenced the tech community and engaged in hacktivism. They have supported political candidates aligned with their values and addressed security flaws in software systems. The group's origins trace back to Texas, where they connected through early internet bulletin boards and shared knowledge and humour. They emphasised inclusivity and challenged hacking elitism.

cDc members played significant roles in developing tools like Tor, which helps evade government censorship, and Back Orifice, which exposed security flaws in Windows systems. They engaged with the media and advocated for user safety and privacy in software development. The group expanded its activities into political activism and hacktivism, supporting pro-democracy movements in China and evading censorship. However, their political direction led to divisions within the group.

cDc members pursued diverse careers in tech, academia, and music. They contributed to projects like Google's Project Zero and responsible vulnerability disclosure. The group's legacy inspired future activists, researchers, and security experts.

The epilogue emphasises the ethical dilemmas in the technology industry, such as encryption, surveillance, and selling to repressive regimes. It calls for better platforms for debate and resolution, a shift towards public-interest technology, and a stronger emphasis on ethics in technology education and professional associations. The moral and ethical challenges in technology require the perspectives of hackers and applied thinking to promote positive change and address the industry's moral crisis.

## An Evening in San Francisco

In 2017, a political fundraiser was held at the San Francisco home of Adam O'Donnell, a member of the hacking group Cult of the Dead Cow (cDc) member. O'Donnell hosted the event to support Beto O'Rourke, a Democratic candidate running for a Senate seat in Texas against Ted Cruz. The cDc, known for its contributions to hacking and hacktivism, has prominent members like Peiter Zatko (Mudge) and Jacob Appelbaum (IOerror). The group has influenced and advised hackers, professionals, and even government officials over the years.

The fundraiser aimed to raise funds for O'Rourke's campaign, which focused on issues such as education, healthcare, jobs, and opposition to President Donald Trump's policies. O'Donnell invited Facebook's chief security officer Alex Stamos to cohost the event. For the cDc, the fundraiser provided an opportunity to reconcile past negative actions by some members, including promoting hate and supporting neo-Nazi publications. O'Rourke's campaign gained momentum and garnered support from cities like San Francisco and Boston, where many cDc members resided.

The fundraiser highlighted the convergence of politics, technology, and activism. It showcased the cDc's involvement in the political process and their support for candidates aligned with their values. The event demonstrated the potential influence of a countercultural hacking group on mainstream political discourse, underscoring the broader impact of the cDc on the tech community.

## Texas T-Files

During the 1980s, Kevin Wheeler, a teenager in Lubbock, Texas, found solace and community through early internet bulletin boards. He formed the Cult of the Dead Cow (cDc) alongside his friends under Pan-Galactic Entropy. Through these online platforms, they shared text files, cracked software versions, and engaged in humour and satire. Kevin operated his bulletin board called Demon Roach Underground, while his friend Brandon, known as "Sid Vicious," excelled in phone phreaking before departing from the group.

Bill Brown, nicknamed "Franken Gibe," joined cDc and met Kevin in person. He embraced the fringe culture and used bulletin boards to connect with like-minded individuals. Despite feeling like outsiders in Lubbock, the group welcomed anyone interested in hacking and challenged self-importance with their inclusive and satirical approach. They expanded their membership by absorbing other bulletin boards and celebrated alternative music as a unifying force. Kevin, using the handle "Swamp Ratte," developed a strategy for distributing cDc text files, while Chris, known as "Nightstalker," provided historical knowledge and guidance from his experience in phone phreaking.

The Cult of the Dead Cow emphasised knowledge sharing, helping others, and advocating for privacy tools and active internet defence. However, being situated in Lubbock posed difficulties in establishing face-to-face connections due to the distance from major cities. Despite this challenge, cDc's bulletin boards provided a platform for like-minded individuals to unite, share ideas, and challenge prevailing notions of hacking elitism.

## The Cons

In the 1990s, the Cult of the Dead Cow (cDc) and its members experienced positive changes as computing became more accessible and knowledge spread among hackers. However, the scattered locations of cDc members in Texas made collaboration challenging. Jesse Dryden, a cDc member and the son of Jefferson Airplane drummer Spencer Dryden, organised the first modern hacking conference called XmasCon or HoHoCon. This conference aimed to bring together hackers, journalists, and even federal agents, with a humorous approach that poked fun at previous private meetings.

The arrests of hackers in 1990 led to caution within the hacking community, forming the Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) to provide legal defence and support for hackers. The rivalry between Legion of Doom (LoD) hacking groups and Masters of Deception (MoD) influenced cDc's commitment to peace and cooperation among hacking tribes. The trial of Phrack contributor Craig Neidorf became a crucial moment for hackers, with the EFF playing a significant role in exposing flaws in the case. John Perry Barlow, a member of the Grateful Dead and a friend of Jesse Dryden, became influential in defending hackers' rights and co-founded the EFF. The trial shed light on hacking and emphasised the importance of understanding and protecting hackers' rights.

Acid and Phiber (Elias Ladopoulos and Mark Abene) were skilled hackers focused on phone-company computers. The hacking war between MoD and LoD escalated, leading MoD to break into Tymnet and spy on LoD members. LoD leaders, Goggans and Chasin, formed ComSec, which involved spying on MoD with the help of the FBI. Ladopoulos and Abene were arrested and served a year in prison. The career paths of hackers varied, with some establishing successful security companies while others worked with intelligence agencies and the Pentagon. Jesse's HoHoCon provided a gathering space for hackers, professional defenders, and law enforcement to foster discussions and relationships. However, Jesse faced personal challenges and resorted to blending truth and lies to protect himself. The decline of social engineering's significance and the shift of cDc's focus to Boston marked a transition to larger endeavours for the group.

## Underground Boston

Boston, with its thriving tech and computer industry, centred around MIT and Harvard, provided an ideal environment for the emergence of the Cult of the Dead Cow (cDc) and its collaborators. Companies like Lotus Development Corporation and BBN Technologies played significant roles in the local tech scene. The Works, an online gathering place founded by Jason Scott Sadofsky in Boston, served as a gateway to riskier hacking boards and facilitated the exchange of information and resources among hackers.

The L0pht, founded in Boston, became the first enduring hackerspace in the United States and a central hub for cDc members. It provided a physical meeting place and think tank for hackers, attracting individuals like John Lester, Brian Hassick, Dan MacMillan, and others who later joined cDc. Regular meet-ups, including the Works and 2600 meetings, allowed hackers to connect, share knowledge, and plan activities such as conventions and road trips. Notable attendees like Luke Benfey, Limor Fried, and Dylan Shea became cDc members.

Boston's presence in the hacker community was strengthened by established computer and software companies and prestigious educational institutions. cDc members found employment at companies like Lotus Development Corporation and BBN Technologies, further contributing to the growth and influence of the hacker community in the area. However, as technology advanced and public awareness of computers and the internet grew, cDc faced the challenge of maintaining its reputation and acceptance in both the hacker world and the mainstream. Amidst this, Mudge emerged as a prominent figure within cDc, possessing expertise in both the hacker community and the realms of security and government.

## Back Orifice

Peiter "Mudge" Zatko, a talented musician and hacker, joined BBN Technologies and later became a member of the L0pht in 1996. His involvement marked a significant turning point for the Cult of the Dead Cow (cDc), establishing them as authoritative figures in security. Mudge's complex ethical code and curiosity about how things worked extended beyond computers, driving cDc's culture-jamming approach to raise awareness of security issues and protect consumers. The group engaged with the media to promote their message.

Josh Buchbinder, known as Sir Dystic, joined cDc and developed Back Orifice, a program that exposed severe security flaws in Windows systems. With cDc's support, Josh pressured Microsoft into addressing these vulnerabilities. He sought legal guidance from the FBI to ensure his actions were within the boundaries of the law. The theatrical release of Back Orifice at Def Con in 1998 garnered media attention and facilitated its distribution to the public. Microsoft downplayed the program's significance, leading to differing opinions between the company and the hacking community.

As cDc expanded its presence to California, it continued its efforts to raise awareness of software vulnerabilities and prove their enduring impact. Christien Rioux joined the group to address the vulnerabilities of Windows NT, further advancing cDc's mission. Frustrated with Microsoft's response, the group persisted in their endeavours, aiming to make a lasting contribution to understanding security issues.

## One Million Dollars and a Monster Truck

As cDc gained mainstream attention, some early members, like Bill Brown, became less involved. In contrast, cDc shifted its focus towards technical expertise, resulting in fewer countercultural and diverse members. However, a talented programmer named Christien Rioux joined both the L0pht and cDc, making significant contributions to their activities. Christien, known as "Dildog," discovered a vulnerability in Internet Explorer 4 and published it under his handle. The L0pht engaged in negotiations with companies like Microsoft to coordinate the disclosure of security flaws, attracting the attention of government officials like Richard Clarke. Their testimony before Senator Fred Thompson's committee recognised them as rock-star hackers.

The L0pht and cDc criticised Microsoft's response to security issues and aimed to expose flaws in the Windows operating system by developing Back Orifice 2000 (BO2k). They wanted Microsoft to take responsibility and improve user education about security. They intended to release BO2k's open-source code to dispel misconceptions, emphasising its safety without any backdoor. BO2k was designed to be easily adjustable, making it harder for antivirus programs to detect. The Atlanta FBI issued a warning about BO2k, cautioning potential targets about its potential for destruction and difficulty in eradicating.

While cDc took precautions regarding legal liability and hired a lawyer to ensure compliance with export regulations, they marketed BO2k as a remote administration tool to challenge established security companies and their expensive remote tools. Security companies classified BO2k as a virus, but renowned expert Bruce Schneier recognised its value for system administrators and criticised Microsoft's security practices. Initially downplaying the issues, Microsoft privately panicked and sought a video of the Def Con presentation. The launch of BO2k raised awareness among Microsoft customers, leading to increased security measures and budgets in the industry. cDc's success with BO2k solidified its position in the security culture and continued to advocate for enhanced user safety and privacy in software development.

## Oxblood

Laird Brown, an influential Cult of the Dead Cow (cDc) member, played a significant role in shaping the group's trajectory. He believed cDc should go beyond technology and address broader issues such as corporate power and government inaction. Inspired by his connections to Chinese dissidents, Laird expanded cDc into political activism and advocated using technology to support causes like pro-democracy movements in China. His storytelling and marketing skills helped cDc gain media attention and spread its message.

Within cDc, discussions about hacktivism emerged, with Laird leading a strategic alliance between cDc and a Chinese pro-democracy group called the Hong Kong Blondes—the coalition aimed to highlight shared goals and the international nature of the hacking community. Chris "Nightstalker" Tucker and Sam emphasised the importance of political activism and raising awareness about marginalised groups' struggles. The media coverage of the Hong Kong Blondes, including an interview with a pseudonymous Chinese dissident named Blondie Wong, gained attention but faced scepticism due to the lack of verifiable evidence.

Laird orchestrated the media strategy for cDc, using the term "hacktivism" and selectively addressing reporters' questions. While the Los Angeles Times published a feature story on the Hong Kong Blondes, doubts arose about their credibility. Laird clarified details about his relationship with Blondie Wong and redirected the conversation towards human rights abuses in China and the potential of open-source software. cDc condemned destructive methods, even as some hackers defaced Chinese government websites in response to the Hong Kong Blondes' story. Laird later founded Hacktivismo, a cDc offshoot focused on projects that evaded censorship and ensured secure communication. However, the political direction of cDc led to criticism from some hackers, and Laird's connections to intelligence agencies became apparent.

## Much @stake

Digital security companies failed to provide adequate safety measures during the dot-com bubble as software systems became increasingly complex. The L0pht crew believed convincing software makers to prioritise security was crucial for global security. They explored outside investment and engaged with Battery Ventures, which presented a $10 million deal to merge the L0pht with @stake. However, the clash of cultures between the L0pht and @stake became evident, despite @stake's positive impact on Microsoft's Windows security. Disclosure policies and the venture capital model posed challenges, leading to @stake's acquisition by Symantec. This period saw the establishment of the precedent that outsiders could contribute to the security of large companies.

The hacker movement experienced fragmentation and a physical diaspora following the 9/11 attacks. Many hackers shifted their focus to government or military work, leading to ethical challenges and moral conflicts. Transitioning to corporate and government roles posed difficulties preserving secrets and caused psychological struggles. Hackers with criminal backgrounds found opportunities to collaborate with the government through contractors or engage in paid security research. The grey market for zero-day vulnerabilities grew as offensive capabilities expanded, challenging the defence's ability to keep pace. Ethical debates arose within the hacker community, and some hackers engaged in intramural hacking. Former members of @stake established companies to enhance security and collaborate with software vendors, triggering a period of moral reckoning and ethical dilemmas in the security community.

## Tor and Citizen Lab

The Cult of the Dead Cow (cDc) influenced the development of tools for evading government censorship, such as Peekabooty, which inspired the creation of Xerobank and the Onion Router (Tor) project. Tor received support from organisations like the EFF and Human Rights Watch, and its development was propelled by Hacktivismo and projects like Xerobank. cDc's influence extended beyond tools, inspiring individuals like Nathan Freitas and Nart Villeneuve to engage in hacktivism and contribute to projects to protect vulnerable groups. Freitas worked on safeguarding shortwave radio and assisting the Tibet Action Institute. At the same time, Villeneuve joined the OpenNet Initiative and later introduced Ron Deibert to establish the Citizen Lab at the University of Toronto.

With its independent academic structure, the Citizen Lab conducted research and published information on topics others couldn't, collaborating with organisations like Google, Amnesty International, and the EFF. Their investigations covered web filters, state-sponsored spying, and the sale of exploits. The lab gained attention for its research on the Chinese GhostNet spy network. However, the lab faced challenges with disclosure and determining whom to inform about cyber espionage, inadvertently involving Western intelligence agencies through individuals assisting hacktivist causes. Chinese hacking incidents, including the targeting of Google, raised awareness of cyberwar complexities, further highlighted by events involving Edward Snowden.

The expansion of the Tor Project, driven by the XeroBank browser, led to its use in countries with high surveillance levels. Concerns arose about potential backdoors for US intelligence agencies, despite Tor's public source code. Jacob Appelbaum, a Cult of the Dead Cow (cDc) member, became a prominent advocate for Tor, contributing to its popularity through personal engagement and teaching others. cDc members had mixed views on WikiLeaks, admiring its exposure to government misconduct but disagreeing with Julian Assange's management style and information disclosure.

The rise of Anonymous, connected to cDc through the 4chan community, involved actions like denial-of-service attacks on corporations in response to pressure on WikiLeaks. Ethical debates arose within cDc regarding the activities of Anonymous, with divisions over civil disobedience and censorship. Criminal elements and foreign entities infiltrated Anonymous, compromising its integrity. Edward Snowden's revelations prompted the development of secure alternatives like Signal, led by Moxie Marlinspike. Appelbaum's allegations of sexual misconduct caused upheaval within cDc, leading to public distancing and a broader examination of sexual misconduct in the hacker community. WikiLeaks faced criticism for its association with Appelbaum and its involvement in the 2016 US election.


## Mixter, Muench, and Phineas

During the 2000s, integrating the Internet into major economies revealed security weaknesses that governments and intelligence agencies exploited. The Cult of the Dead Cow (cDc) had a broad influence, including Edward Snowden's revelations about the collaboration between Western intelligence agencies and technology companies. This collaboration facilitated a dark market for software vulnerabilities and hacking techniques, posing risks to individuals' security and enabling surveillance of human rights advocates and journalists.

Companies like Gamma Group and Hacking Team faced scrutiny for their spyware, suspected of being used by repressive regimes against dissidents. Activists and hackers exposed these operations, leading to public outrage and legal action. Phineas Fisher, an anonymous hacker, emerged as part of the "public interest hacking" trend, targeting surveillance software vendors due to moral objections. The Shadow Brokers group, responsible for leaking NSA tools, had unclear origins, but Russian intelligence was likely involved.

The encryption debate involved companies like Apple and Google, who resisted government demands for back doors and championed end-to-end encryption. The hacktivist community, including cDc, criticised companies like Gamma Group but avoided illegal activities. Some hackers shifted their focus to supporting startups and creating platforms for informed debate and collaborative problem-solving. Views within the hacktivist community varied on authorised offensive work, with some favouring it over traditional military action and others prioritising defence and internet safety.

## Mudge and Dildog

Peiter Zatko, known as Mudge, played a pivotal role in the tech security industry. Despite not being highly engaged in executive positions, Mudge recognised the fundamental flaws in tech security, including software vulnerabilities, lack of liability for vendors, and insufficient regulation. He joined BBN Technologies 2003, later working on R&D for US intelligence agencies and training personnel for the NSA's hacking unit. Mudge's appointment at DARPA allowed him to lead cybersecurity efforts, create the Cyber Fast Track program, and develop the Cyber Analytic Framework. He opposed back doors in encryption and advocated for ethical boundaries in hacking.

After leaving the government, Mudge joined Google, working on secret projects and developing secure operating systems. He eventually left Google to start the nonprofit Cyber Independent Testing Lab (CITL), funded by DARPA and others, which assessed the safety features of code. Despite health challenges, Mudge remained active in cybersecurity, serving as the head of security at Stripe and advising Senator Mark Warner on cybersecurity.

Other Cult of the Dead Cow members pursued diverse careers, including starting companies like Veracode, which analysed program safety, and engaging in academia and the music industry. The group's legacy can be seen in its inspiration to future activists, researchers, and security experts, contributing to projects like Google's Project Zero and the growth of responsible vulnerability disclosure.

## The Congressman and the Trolls

Former members of the Cult of the Dead Cow (cDc) noticed Beto O'Rourke's political progress in El Paso, Texas, where he advocated for liberalised drug laws and authored a book on marijuana legalisation. With a background in technology and punk rock, Beto won a seat in Congress in 2013 and gained attention for live streaming a House sit-in. Recognising the potential impact of a Senate position, Beto challenged Republican Ted Cruz in the 2018 Senate race and utilised his tech savvy, grassroots campaigning, and ability to connect with younger voters to gain traction.

The cDc, despite diverse political views among its members, had protégés on both sides of the political spectrum, engaging in various activities. They addressed offensive posts and content associated with some members and groups. Facebook's lax data collection policies, exemplified by the Cambridge Analytica scandal, brought increased scrutiny to tech companies' role in allowing disinformation and manipulation. Former tech executives criticised their former employers for enabling fake news. Beto's connection to cDc was revealed to Alex Stamos, who supported Beto's campaign. Beto's grassroots appeal and policy positions resonated with many, positioning him as a potential national political figure and a contender in the presidential race.


## Epilogue

The Cult of the Dead Cow (cDc) transformed from mischievous teenage hackers into influential critical thinkers and activists, shaping discussions on vulnerability disclosure, security, and human rights. With members from diverse backgrounds and professions, cDc significantly shaped security conversations in Silicon Valley and Washington. Their influence extended beyond hacking to include civil disobedience, military support, and activism, highlighting the importance of diverse groups with shared values.

The technology industry faces ethical dilemmas in areas such as encryption, malware campaigns, selling to repressive regimes, and government surveillance requests, which require better platforms for debate and resolution. A shift towards public-interest technology and a stronger emphasis on ethics in technology education and professional associations are necessary. Technology's moral and ethical challenges have far-reaching implications for safety, privacy, and surveillance. Drawing wisdom from past experiences can guide decision-making in the industry as technology continues to gain power. The perspectives of hackers and applied thinking are crucial in addressing the moral crisis in technology and promoting positive change. The world needs more ethical and responsible actions, even if they challenge traditional legal frameworks.
