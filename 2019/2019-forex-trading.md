# Forex Trading: Two Round Number Strategies
**Authors**: Heikin Ashi Trader | **Year**: 2019

## Summary
This concise trading guide presents two practical strategies specifically designed for forex markets, addressing the unique challenges of currency trading in an era of historically low volatility. The author argues that traditional trend-following approaches struggle in forex due to the market's high liquidity and tendency to move sideways rather than trend. Instead, traders need strategies that work within these constraints by targeting small, predictable price movements around psychologically significant price levels.

Forex traders struggling with traditional methods will find value in these systematic approaches. The book is ideal for part-time traders who need "set and forget" strategies that don't require constant monitoring, offering a realistic path to consistent profits through probability-based trading rather than chasing unlikely big wins.

## Core Insights

### The Forex Market Reality
Modern forex trading is characterized by three critical features: extreme liquidity with over $4 trillion traded daily, daily fluctuations typically below 1%, and historically low volatility due to zero-interest-rate environments. These conditions make traditional trend-following strategies ineffective for most traders. The key insight is that success requires adapting to these market realities rather than fighting against them.

> "Foreign exchange markets tend to show trend behavior in exceptional cases. In other words, currency pairs run sideways on most trading days."

**Quick Take**: Stop trying to catch big trends in forex and instead focus on small, predictable movements that happen repeatedly.

### Strategy 1: The Round Number Strategy
This strategy capitalizes on the tendency of currency pairs to reverse at psychologically significant round numbers (like 1.1200 in EURUSD). Traders place limit orders exactly at these levels with 30 pips stop loss and 30 pips profit target, creating a 1:1 risk-reward ratio. The strategy works best with currency pairs like USDCAD, USDCHF, AUDUSD, and others, while avoiding the heavily traded EURUSD and GBPUSD.

> "The round-figure strategy works well with the following currency pairs: USDCAD, USDCHF, AUDUSD, NZDUSD, EURJPY, USDJPY, EURGBP and EURCHF"

**Quick Take**: Set bracket orders at round numbers and let the market do the work - this is perfect for traders with day jobs.

### Strategy 2: The Stop Hunting Strategy
This momentum strategy assumes that big players "hunt" stops clustered around round numbers. When a market approaches within 15 pips of a round number, traders enter in the direction of that level, expecting the momentum to continue and hit the target. Like the first strategy, it uses a 1:1 risk-reward ratio (15 pips risk, 15 pips reward) and works best with the same recommended currency pairs.

> "The idea of this strategy is precisely that you can assume that, as soon as the market approaches the round number, momentum traders will 'hunt' the round number"

**Quick Take**: Position yourself 15 pips away from round numbers in the direction of the level and ride the momentum to the target.

### Trading as a Probability Game
Both strategies are designed as probability-based approaches rather than prediction methods. With hit rates above 50-60%, traders can build consistent profits through repetition and proper position sizing. A trader averaging 20 trades per month with a 60% hit rate using standard lots could generate approximately $1,200 monthly - a realistic foundation for a trading business.

> "Since the patterns in forex trading repeat themselves over and over again, you can approach the matter with very simple methods and let the math work for you in the long term."

**Quick Take**: Focus on achieving a slight edge through repetition rather than trying to be right on every trade.

## Best Quotes
- "If you trade strategies that are based on trend behavior (such as trend following strategies), you are not going to do very well in those markets."
- "The strategy is a pure 'set and forget strategy'. This means that you should always work with bracket orders."
- "Only very few traders (if any) achieve that [50 pips a day]. But having a robust monthly yield of 120 pips is quite feasible."
- "Most newbies trade EURUSD and GBPUSD, although these are proven to be the pairs the hardest to trade."
- "You only need to make a little more profit than loss to earn a fortune in forex."

## Action Items
- Practice both strategies on demo accounts before risking real money
- Focus on the recommended currency pairs (avoid EURUSD and GBPUSD)
- Use bracket orders consistently - don't deviate from the 30 pip or 15 pip parameters
- Track your hit rate honestly - you need above 50% for profitability
- Start with mini lots and gradually increase position size as you prove consistency
- Set your orders in the morning and let them work - this strategy requires patience

## Questions to Consider
- Are you mentally prepared for a strategy that wins only 50-60% of the time?
- Do you have the discipline to stick to exact parameters without "improving" them?
- Can you accept modest monthly gains rather than dreaming of overnight riches?
- Are you willing to avoid the popular currency pairs that most traders flock to?
- Do you understand that position sizing matters more than entry accuracy?

## Conclusion
This book is worth your time if you're tired of unrealistic trading promises and want a systematic approach to forex trading. The strategies presented are refreshingly practical and acknowledge the realities of modern currency markets. While the potential profits may seem modest compared to trading marketing hype, the author's realistic approach to consistently generating 120+ pips monthly provides a solid foundation for building a trading business.

The biggest reason to read this book is its grounding in market reality rather than fantasy. The strategies won't make you rich overnight, but they offer a legitimate path to consistent profits through probability-based trading. For traders willing to accept modest wins and maintain discipline, these round number strategies provide a viable alternative to the failed trend-following approaches that dominate most trading education.
