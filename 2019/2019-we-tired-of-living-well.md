**Author**: Albert Soler | **Year**: 2019
**Category**: History & Biography

## Summary
"We Tired of Living Well" is a biting satirical collection of newspaper articles by Catalan journalist Albert Soler, written between 2016 and 2019, that offers a scathing critique of Catalonia's independence movement. The title comes from a conversation between two elderly fishermen who concluded that Catalans, bored with their comfortable prosperous lives, created political chaos just to feel alive.

Soler uses razor-sharp wit and dark humor to dissect what he sees as the absurdity, hypocrisy, and destructive nature of the "procés" (the process toward Catalan independence). Through a series of articles originally published in Diari de Girona, he lampoons independence leaders, mocks their supporters, and documents what he views as a collective delusion that threatened to destroy Catalonia's prosperity and social harmony.

This book will appeal to readers interested in Spanish politics, Catalan identity, and the power of satire to critique political movements. It offers a contrarian voice that challenges the dominant narrative around Catalan independence while providing laughs through its clever observations and memorable characterizations.

## Core Insights

### The Prosperity Paradox
Catalans had achieved what most societies dream of: economic prosperity, high living standards, cultural autonomy, and self-government. Yet, according to Soler, this very success bred boredom and a manufactured sense of grievance. The independence movement emerged not from genuine oppression but from an existential emptiness that could only be filled by creating drama and conflict.

> "We were tired of living well"
> _Original: "Estábamos cansados de vivir bien"_
**Quick Take**: Comfort and prosperity don't guarantee political stability; sometimes they breed the desire for chaos.

### The Performance of Rebellion
Soler reveals how the independence movement was largely theatrical—people playing revolutionaries on weekends while maintaining their comfortable lifestyles. The "revolution of smiles" involved street demonstrations during the day followed by returning to comfortable homes at night, with no real willingness to sacrifice for the cause.

> "We'll all go home to sleep when the first punch is thrown"
> _Original: "En cuanto se reparta la primera hostia, todos para casa a cenar y a dormir bien"_
**Quick Take**: Political movements that lack real commitment often dissolve when faced with genuine consequences.

### Leadership as Farce
The book systematically demolishes the myth of heroic independence leaders, portraying them instead as clowns, opportunists, and incompetents. Puigdemont becomes "Vivales" (a hustler), while other figures are reduced to caricatures of their own vanity and foolishness.

> "He's parking his principles for 18 months"
> _Original: "Aparcar los principios durante 18 meses"_
**Quick Take**: Political movements often fail when their leaders are more interested in personal glory than genuine principles.

### The Corruption of Language
Soler documents how the independence movement hijacked language—words like "democracy," "freedom," and "oppression" were twisted to mean their opposites. Political prisoners became "presos políticos" despite having had fair trials, while those who disagreed were labeled "fascists" and "traitors."

> "Freedom of expression... but only for those who agree with us"
> _Original: "La libertad de expresión... pero sólo para quienes piensan como nosotros"_
**Quick Take**: Watch how political movements manipulate language to control thought and silence opposition.

### The International Illusion
The independence movement sold the fantasy that the world supported their cause and that recognition was imminent. Soler mercilessly debunks this, showing how Catalan leaders lived in a bubble of self-delusion while the international community largely ignored or dismissed their aspirations.

> "The world is watching us... to see how to screw up"
> _Original: "El mundo nos mira... para ver cómo la cagan"_
**Quick Take**: Political movements built on international validation are vulnerable to reality checks.

## Best Quotes

- "A revolution can triumph if the majority of the people live at bare minimum, whether political or economic. When there's no option but to go for it all. When risking everything isn't a possibility: it's the only possibility."

  _Original: "A los catalanes nos encanta adoptar mascotas españolas. Mascotas humanas, quiero precisar. A la que olemos un español favorable al procés le arrullamos, le abrigamos, le colocamos un collar antiparásitos y le lanzamos una galleta para que la cace al vuelo haciendo una pirueta."_

## Key Takeaways

- **Prosperity isn't everything**: Economic success doesn't guarantee political satisfaction or social harmony
- **Beware manufactured grievances**: Political movements often create problems to solve when none exist
- **Satire as political weapon**: Humor can be more effective than serious argument in exposing political absurdity
- **Media complicity**: Journalists and media outlets often enable rather than challenge political delusions
- **Personal responsibility**: Citizens must distinguish between genuine political causes and manufactured crises

## Questions to Consider

1. Why do prosperous societies sometimes seek political turmoil? Is boredom a legitimate political motivation?
2. Can satire change political opinions, or does it only reinforce existing beliefs?
3. What role should the international community play in regional independence movements?
4. How can societies maintain political engagement without falling into manufactured crises?
5. At what point does political opposition become obstructionism?

## Conclusion
"We Tired of Living Well" is both hilarious and sobering—a reminder that democracy depends on citizens valuing what they have rather than destroying it for fantasies of something better. Soler's wit cuts through the noise of political rhetoric to expose uncomfortable truths about human nature and the destructive potential of collective delusion.

The book is worth reading for its sheer entertainment value, but its lasting value lies in how it demonstrates that sometimes the most patriotic act is to laugh at those who would sacrifice prosperity for pipe dreams. In an era of political polarization worldwide, Soler's skepticism serves as a necessary antidote to political fervor that loses touch with reality.

While readers may disagree with Soler's political views, his craftsmanship as a satirist is undeniable, and his observations about the gap between revolutionary rhetoric and bourgeois reality resonate far beyond Catalonia. This isn't just a book about Catalan independence—it's about the universal human tendency to create drama when life becomes too comfortable.
