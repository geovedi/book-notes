## Core Framework: The 7-Stage Job Success System

### Stage 2: Maintaining Motivation
**Understanding Your Motivation Challenges**
Unemployment affects different people differently—school leavers facing first-job anxiety, career changers, people with disabilities, or those retrenched after years of service. Recognize your specific situation and address it directly.
