# Think Like Sherlock
**Authors**: Peter Hollins | **Year**: 2019

## Summary
"Think Like Sherlock" is a practical guide to developing the legendary detective's problem-solving mindset and analytical techniques. While acknowledging that we can't all match Sherlock Holmes' superhuman intellect, the book breaks down his core methodologies into learnable skills that anyone can apply to everyday challenges. Hollins demonstrates that Holmes' genius wasn't just innate talent but rather the disciplined application of observation, critical thinking, and creative problem-solving techniques.

This book is perfect for professionals, students, and anyone looking to improve their analytical abilities, decision-making skills, and problem-solving capabilities. Readers will walk away with concrete frameworks for thinking more clearly, observing more carefully, and approaching problems with Sherlock-like precision.

## Core Frameworks

### The Sherlock Mindset: Embrace Objectivity
Sherlock Holmes' primary advantage was his relentless commitment to objective facts over assumptions or emotional reactions. He approached every situation with disciplined observation and logical reasoning, gathering data before forming conclusions. For Holmes, problems weren't mysteries to be solved by intuition but puzzles that required systematic analysis of available evidence.

> "Once you eliminate the impossible, whatever remains, no matter how improbable, must be the truth." – Sherlock Holmes

**Quick Take**: Start every problem by gathering facts rather than forming opinions. Let evidence lead your conclusions rather than letting conclusions shape your evidence.

### SCAMPER: Seven Paths to Creative Solutions
The SCAMPER method provides seven structured approaches to innovative thinking and problem-solving. Each technique offers a different lens for examining challenges and generating solutions beyond conventional thinking patterns.

- **Substitute**: Replace elements with alternatives (e.g., different materials, processes, or locations)
- **Combine**: Merge two or more ideas to create something better (like the spork combining spoon and fork)
- **Adapt**: Adjust existing solutions to fit new contexts or requirements
- **Magnify/Minimize**: Exaggerate or reduce elements to gain new perspectives
- **Put to Another Use**: Find new applications for existing resources or solutions
- **Eliminate**: Remove unnecessary components to streamline and improve
- **Reverse**: Change the order or approach entirely (exercising in morning vs. evening)

**Quick Take**: When stuck, systematically apply all seven SCAMPER techniques to your problem. At least one will likely reveal overlooked solutions.

### Mastering Observation: The Art of Noticing Details
Sherlock's famous observational skills weren't magical—they resulted from deliberate practice in noticing details others miss. The book outlines five key techniques for developing observation abilities:

1. **Become detail-oriented**: Practice noticing 10 non-obvious details about people or situations
2. **Give 100% focus**: Eliminate distractions and practice single-minded attention
3. **Note differences from baseline**: Understand what's normal to detect abnormalities
4. **Understand people's self-perceptions**: Observe how others see themselves
5. **See the big picture**: Connect individual details into meaningful patterns

> "The little details are by far the most important." – Sherlock Holmes

**Quick Take**: Spend five minutes daily practicing active observation. You'll be amazed at what you've been missing.

### Perspective Shifting: Redefine Problems to Find Solutions
Sometimes the problem isn't the situation itself but how you're framing it. The book teaches multiple techniques for shifting perspective to reveal new solutions:

- **Invert problems**: Instead of asking how to succeed, ask what causes failure
- **Paraphrase**: Restate problems using different words to trigger new thinking
- **Redirect focus**: Attack related issues that indirectly solve the main problem
- **Vary stress patterns**: Emphasize different words in the problem statement
- **Use hypotheticals**: Ask "what if" questions to challenge assumptions

**Quick Take**: If you're stuck on a problem, restate it in at least three different ways. Each reframing opens new solution pathways.

### The Astronaut Method: Eight Steps to Critical Thinking
Adapted from NASA's Apollo 13 mission protocols, this systematic approach ensures thorough problem-solving even under pressure:

1. **Define the problem** objectively and specifically
2. **Determine goals and objectives** beyond just "fixing it"
3. **Generate alternative solutions** through brainstorming
4. **Evaluate consequences** of each option
5. **Make a decision** based on analysis
6. **Implement the solution** systematically
7. **Monitor results** and adjust as needed
8. **Learn from the process** for future problems

> "Failure is not an option." – Gene Kranz, NASA Director

**Quick Take**: Use this eight-step framework for any significant decision or problem. It prevents jumping to conclusions and ensures comprehensive analysis.

## Best Quotes

- "Once you eliminate the impossible, whatever remains, no matter how improbable, must be the truth." – Sherlock Holmes
- "The little details are by far the most important." – Sherlock Holmes
- "Failure is not an option." – Gene Kranz
- "How often have I said to you that when you have eliminated the impossible, whatever remains, however improbable, must be the truth?" – Sherlock Holmes

## Action Items

- **Practice daily observation**: Spend 10 minutes each day noticing 10 details about your environment or interactions
- **Apply SCAMPER weekly**: Use all seven techniques on one problem or challenge each week
- **Question assumptions**: Before accepting any conclusion, ask "what if this isn't true?" and explore alternatives
- **Use the five whys**: When facing any problem, ask "why" five times to reach root causes
- **Maintain an evidence journal**: Record observations, patterns, and conclusions to track your analytical growth

## Questions to Consider

- What details in your current situation have you been overlooking that might hold the key to solving your biggest challenge?
- Which of your current problems might be solved by simply redefining them from a different perspective?
- What assumptions are you making that could be eliminating innovative solutions before you even consider them?
- How would Sherlock Holmes approach the most frustrating problem you're currently facing?

## Conclusion
"Think Like Sherlock" is worth your time if you're looking to develop practical analytical skills rather than just academic knowledge. The book's strength lies in breaking down Holmes' legendary abilities into learnable techniques that anyone can practice and master.

The biggest reason to read this book is its actionable framework for improving decision-making and problem-solving. While you won't become Sherlock Holmes overnight, you'll develop the core skills of observation, critical thinking, and creative problem-solving that made him legendary. In a world filled with information overload and snap judgments, the ability to think clearly and analyze systematically is more valuable than ever.
