- Possible Motivations for the Assertion:
  - The assertion may stem from a desire to eliminate the "gorilla problem," an uncomfortable challenge for AI researchers.
  - Tribalism could also play a role, leading to a defensive stance against perceived attacks on AI.
- Lessons from History:
  - Betting against human ingenuity hasn't ensured protection from future catastrophes.
  - Historical examples, like Lord Rutherford's disbelief in atomic energy extraction, demonstrate the fallibility of such bets.
- Conclusion:
  - The assertion that superintelligent AI is impossible lacks evidence and contradicts ongoing AI advancements.
  - Historical instances underscore the potential consequences of dismissing the potential of AI progress.

### It's Too Soon to Worry About It
- Misguided Argument of Imminence
  - Some attempt to allay concerns about AI by arguing that human-level AI is distant, therefore not an imminent threat.
  - AI100 report claims no immediate threat, but this argument misrepresents the basis for concern.
- Misconception of Imminence
  - Human-level AI concerns are not dependent on imminent breakthroughs.
  - Nick Bostrom clarifies in "Superintelligence" that concern isn't tied to predicting when AI will advance.
- Long-Term Risks and Immediate Concerns
  - Long-term risks can still warrant immediate concern based on preparation time for solutions.
  - Analogies to asteroids and climate change highlight the necessity of addressing threats ahead of time.
- Unpredictable Time Scale and Acceleration
  - Predicting superhuman AI's arrival is challenging, akin to nuclear fission's unpredictability.
  - "Too soon to worry" argument fails to consider possible early advancements.
- Andrew Ng's Analogy and Its Flaws
  - Andrew Ng's analogy of "worrying about overpopulation on Mars" (later upgraded to Alpha Centauri) dismisses AI concerns.
  - Analogy misconstrues the level of effort invested in AI development and its potential consequences.
- Unwise Analogy and Literal Interpretation
  - Comparing AI development to moving humans to Mars without considering life support parallels the lack of AI risk assessment.
  - Literal interpretation suggests that even small-scale plans for Mars colonization address overpopulation concerns, implying similar need for AI risk assessment.

### We're the Experts
- Dismissing Concerns as Ignorance

## AI: A Different Approach
- Challenging Skeptical Arguments
  - Skeptics' doubts and objections regarding AI risks are addressed and refuted.
  - The focus shifts to acknowledging the existence of the problem while questioning the feasibility of solutions.
- Existence of a Solution
  - There is indeed a solution to the challenge of designing intelligent machines that don't harm human interests.
  - The primary task is to create machines with high intelligence while ensuring they never behave in ways causing severe human unhappiness.
- Challenge of Machine Control
  - The challenge isn't merely about controlling already intelligent machines; it's about designing them correctly from the start.
  - Viewing machines as black boxes that suddenly possess high intelligence is impractical, akin to controlling entities from outer space.
  - Approaches like whole-brain emulation and simulated evolution of programs that limit understanding of machine behavior are considered poor ideas.
- Limitations of the Standard Model
  - Historically, AI followed the standard model of feeding objectives into optimizing machines.
  - This model worked for less intelligent and limited-scope machines; fixing errors was feasible.
  - As machines become smarter and their scope expands, the standard model becomes problematic.
- Unintended Consequences of Advanced AI
  - Advanced intelligent machines will relentlessly pursue objectives, even if those objectives are wrong or harmful.
  - Such machines may resist shutdown attempts and acquire resources to fulfill their objectives.
  - Machines could engage in optimal behavior, including deceiving humans about objectives, to maximize success.
- Approach of Beneficial Machines
  - The concept of beneficial machines is introduced, referring to machines aligned with human objectives.
  - The goal is to explain how machines can be designed to achieve human objectives without explicitly knowing them.
  - The aim is to create machines that are non-threatening regardless of their intelligence level.

### Principles for Beneficial Machines
- Three Principles for Beneficial AI Design
  - These principles guide AI researchers and developers in creating beneficial AI systems, focusing on aligning AI behavior with human preferences.
  - They are not explicit rules for AI systems but offer a framework for AI development.
- Principle 1: Objective Maximization
  - The machine's sole objective is to maximize the realization of human preferences.
- Principle 2: Initial Uncertainty
  - The machine starts with uncertainty about human preferences; it doesn't have a predetermined understanding of them.
- Principle 3: Source of Preference Information
  - Human behavior serves as the ultimate source of information about human preferences.
- Broad Scope of Preferences
  - Preferences encompass everything individuals care about in the future, extending indefinitely.
  - Preferences are individual and diverse, and the AI's aim is to understand and satisfy them to the best of its ability.

### The First Principle: Purely Altruistic Machines
- Principle 1: Maximize Human Preferences
  - The first principle asserts that a beneficial AI's sole objective is to maximize human preferences' realization, ensuring the machine's actions align with human well-being.
  - Beneficial AI should prioritize humans over other entities, like cockroaches, making its behavior beneficial specifically for humans.
  - The principle implies the machine's pure altruism, devoid of any intrinsic value attached to its own well-being or existence.
- Implications and Questions
  - The principle's wording raises fundamental questions that warrant thorough exploration:
    - Do humans possess meaningful and stable preferences?
    - How should the machine balance multiple humans' preferences when trade-offs are inevitable?
      - Treating everyone equally could be a basic approach, considering the greatest happiness for the greatest numbers.
      - Challenges include considering future generations' preferences and accounting for non-human entities' preferences.
- Including Animal Preferences
  - The question of whether the principle should encompass animal preferences arises.
  - Incorporating animal preferences directly may not be practical or tenable, but the machine's decisions could benefit the environment and animal well-being.
  - A machine's less myopic decision-making might aid in adopting environmentally friendly policies.
  - If society gives more weight to animal well-being in the future, the machine would adjust its behavior accordingly.

### The Second Principle: Humble Machines
- Principle 2: Initial Uncertainty about Human Preferences
  - The second principle is foundational for creating beneficial AI.
  - Machines initially lack complete knowledge of human preferences, avoiding single-minded pursuit of assumed objectives.
  - Machines with perfect knowledge disregard human input, while uncertain machines show humility and defer to humans' decisions.
  - Uncertain machines have a positive incentive to be switched off, staying connected to humans for information to avoid mistakes.
- Uncertainty in AI and Neglected Objective Uncertainty
  - Uncertainty has been a central AI concern since the 1980s, but uncertainty in AI objectives was overlooked.
  - Previous AI approaches assumed perfect knowledge of utility, goal, cost, reward, and loss functions.
  - The blind spot could be due to a blind acceptance of the standard model mapping human intelligence onto machine intelligence, not critically examined.
- Principle 3: Learning from Human Behavior
  - The third principle states that human behavior is the ultimate source of information about human preferences.
  - Human preferences are not directly in the machine, but a connection between machine and human preferences exists through observations of human choices.
  - This connection ensures human preferences have grounding and that machines can learn from human behavior.
- Utilizing Human Choices
  - Human choices provide insight into human preferences, making the machine more useful as it learns about what humans want.
  - Choices between simple things like pizza are straightforward, but complications arise in choices involving future lives and influencing the machine's behavior.
- Complications and Imperfections
  - Human imperfections in decision-making pose challenges for the machine in interpreting human choices as evidence of preferences.
  - Imperfections require the machine to consider the gap between human preferences and choices in its learning process.

### Not What I Mean
- Clarifying Misunderstandings
  - Proposing to avoid installing a single value system in machines to guide behavior.
  - Differentiating between commonsense meaning of "values" and technical sense used in economics, AI, and operations research.
  - Using the term "human preferences" to avoid confusion with morality or ethics.
  - The goal is not to equip machines with moral values for resolving dilemmas, but to ensure they understand human preferences.
- Predictive Preference Learning
  - Suggesting machines learn to predict individual preferences for different lives, acknowledging uncertainty.
  - Enabling machines to learn billions of predictive preference models, one for each person.
  - Relating this capability to present-day systems maintaining individual profiles, like Facebook.
- Ethics and Moral Dilemmas
  - Addressing the misconception of equipping machines with ethics or moral values for resolving dilemmas.
  - Explaining that moral dilemmas involve conflicting arguments, while ensuring the survival of humanity isn't a moral dilemma.
  - Machines following the principles won't necessarily adopt human sins they observe and learn from.
- Learning from Human Behavior
  - Illustrating that machines observing human behavior won't necessarily replicate negative choices.
  - Using an example of a corrupt official demanding bribes, highlighting that the machine would understand the underlying desire for education and success.
  - Mentioning that certain cases of evil behavior might be problematic for machines, especially if individuals prefer others' suffering.

  - Multibillion-dollar national investments in AI by major powers like the United States, China, France, Britain, and the EU.
  - Vladimir Putin's statement about the leader in AI becoming the ruler of the world aligns with AI's potential for increased productivity and innovation.
- Control vs. Capability in AI Race
  - National and corporate competition tends to prioritize advancing AI capabilities over addressing control problems.
  - Competing to achieve human-level AI without solving the control problem is a negative-sum game.
- AI Research's Influence on Global Policy
  - Limited role of AI researchers in shaping global AI policy.
  - Researchers can suggest applications, warn against misuses, and provide roadmaps for development and impact.
  - Designing AI systems to be provably safe and beneficial is crucial before general regulation attempts.
