# Confidence
**Original Title**: Confidenza
**Author**: Domenico Starnone | **Year**: 2019

## Summary
"Confidenza" (Confidence) is a masterful psychological novel that explores the dangerous power of secrets and the way we construct our identities through the stories we tell about ourselves. The book consists of three interconnected narratives, each told from a different perspective, revealing how the same events can be remembered, interpreted, and given meaning in radically different ways. At its center is Pietro Vella, a high school literature teacher and intellectual, whose past relationship with a former student continues to reverberate through the present, affecting his family and his legacy.

This book will appeal to readers who appreciate sophisticated psychological fiction, unreliable narration, and novels that examine the complex interplay between memory, truth, and self-deception. Those interested in contemporary Italian literature and authors like Elena Ferrante will find Starnone's exploration of relationships and reputation particularly compelling. The novel offers profound insights into how confession can be both binding and weaponizing, and how the gaze of others shapes our sense of self.

## Core Insights

### The Architecture of Confession
The novel demonstrates how confession operates as both a binding force and a weapon. When Pietro and Teresa exchange their darkest secrets as a way to "remain united forever," they create a bond that proves both indissoluble and destructive. This pact of mutual vulnerability reveals Starnone's central thesis: that sharing our deepest shame creates a permanent connection that can never be fully undone, even when relationships end. The secrets become anchors that tether people together across time and distance, continually pulling them back into each other's orbits.

> "Così rimarremo uniti per sempre"
> _Original: "So we will remain united forever"_

**Quick Take**: Confession creates permanent connections that transcend the boundaries of relationships and time.

### The Three Selves of Memory
Starnone uses his tripartite structure to show how the same events become three different stories. Pietro's version in the first story presents himself as a victim of passion and circumstance. Emma's narrative in the second story reveals a daughter's attempt to construct an idealized version of her father. Teresa's account in the final story reframes everything, suggesting Pietro was the manipulator rather than the manipulated. This structural genius demonstrates that memory itself is a creative act, and that "truth" exists only in the multiplicity of perspectives.

> "Pietro è stato ed è un uomo molto pericoloso"
> _Original: "Pietro was and is a very dangerous man"_

**Quick Take**: Every story has at least three versions, and the truth exists in the tensions between them.

### The Gaze of Others as Identity Mirror
The novel explores how our sense of self is constructed through others' perceptions of us. Pietro's entire career and self-image are built on maintaining his reputation as an uncompromising intellectual who refused to "make deals with power." Yet the book reveals this carefully constructed public persona masks deep insecurities and moral compromises. Starnone suggests that we become dangerous when we try to live up to idealized versions of ourselves that others have projected onto us.

> "Lo sguardo degli altri è la nostra ossessione, la nostra gratificazione, la misura della nostra inadeguatezza. Siamo disposti a perderci, curvando la vita intera, pur di somigliare al nostro profilo migliore."
> _Original: "The gaze of others is our obsession, our gratification, the measure of our inadequacy. We are willing to lose ourselves, bending our whole lives, just to resemble our best profile."_

**Quick Take**: We construct our identities based on how we want to be seen, not who we really are.

### The Seismic Ground of Identity
The novel presents identity as built on "seismic ground"—unstable, shifting, and prone to rupture. Pietro believes he has constructed a stable life as a respected teacher and family man, but Teresa's return threatens to expose the fault lines running through his carefully constructed world. This metaphor suggests that our sense of self is always temporary, constructed on foundations that can shift at any moment, revealing the contradictions and compromises we've buried beneath the surface.

**Quick Take**: Identity is inherently unstable and can collapse when past secrets surface.

## Best Quotes

- "Love as I knew it is a lava of raw life that burns refined life, an eruption that cancels understanding and pity, reason and reasons, geography and history, health and illness, wealth and poverty, exception and rule."
  _Original: "L'amore come l'ho conosciuto io, infatti, è una lava di vita grezza che brucia vita fine, un'eruzione che cancella la comprensione e la pietà, la ragione e le ragioni, la geografia e la storia, la salute e la malattia, la ricchezza e la povertà, l'eccezione e la regola."_

- "We are willing to lose ourselves, bending our whole lives, just to resemble our best profile. It is then that we become dangerous: when we give our best, well knowing that the worst is hiding not far away."
  _Original: "Siamo disposti a perderci, curvando la vita intera, pur di somigliare al nostro profilo migliore. È allora che diventiamo pericolosi: quando diamo il meglio, ben sapendo che il peggio si nasconde poco lontano."_

## Action Items

- **Examine your own narrative**: Consider how you've constructed stories about your past relationships and whether they serve to protect your self-image or reveal deeper truths.

- **Question multiple perspectives**: When recalling shared events, actively seek out how others remember them differently. The truth often exists in the tensions between conflicting memories.

- **Beware the idealized profile**: Recognize when you're trying to live up to others' expectations rather than your authentic self, and acknowledge the danger this poses.

- **Consider the weight of secrets**: Reflect on how the secrets you keep and those you've shared continue to shape your relationships and identity.

## Questions to Consider

1. How does the act of confession create both intimacy and danger in relationships?
2. Can we ever truly know someone else's version of events, or are we always trapped in our own narrative?
3. What secrets from your past continue to influence your present relationships and self-image?
4. How do we balance the desire to be seen favorably by others with the need to remain authentic to ourselves?
5. At what point does maintaining a public persona become a form of self-deception?

## Conclusion

"Confidenza" is a brilliant, tightly constructed novel that delivers profound insights into human psychology and the nature of memory. Starnone's three-part structure perfectly serves his exploration of how the same events can be interpreted in completely different ways, suggesting that truth itself is a narrative construct rather than an objective reality.

The book is absolutely worth your time if you appreciate literary fiction that examines complex psychological territory with precision and depth. At just over 200 pages, it's a concentrated dose of literary brilliance that will leave you questioning the reliability of your own memories and the stories you tell about yourself.

The biggest reason to read this novel is Starnone's masterful use of perspective to reveal how our identities are constructed through the interplay of memory, secrets, and the gaze of others. It's a haunting exploration of how the past continues to shape the present, and how the stories we tell about ourselves ultimately become the reality we inhabit. This is contemporary European fiction at its most psychologically astute and structurally innovative.
