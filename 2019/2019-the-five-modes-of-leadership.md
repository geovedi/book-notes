# The Five Modes of Leadership
**Authors**: Stuart Wyatt | **Year**: 2019

## Summary
"The Five Modes of Leadership" presents a practical framework for effective leadership based on five distinct modes of action: Vision, Plan, Delegate, Enable, and Empower. Stuart Wyatt argues that great leaders instinctively switch between different leadership styles based on situations, people, and circumstances, rather than relying on a single approach. The book provides a systematic yet flexible approach to leadership that can be learned and applied by anyone willing to practice.

This guide is perfect for both new managers developing their leadership toolkit and senior leaders looking to refresh their skills. Readers will gain a clear framework for understanding when and how to adapt their leadership style, along with actionable techniques for each mode that can be immediately applied in real-world situations.

## Core Insights

### Vision Mode: Define and Validate Your Destination
Use Vision mode when you're uncertain about what to achieve or doubt whether a goal is feasible. This mode is about creating crystal-clear clarity and building confidence in your team's ability to succeed.

The key is to write goals so precisely that there can be no disagreement about what constitutes success. Wyatt emphasizes that vague goals lead to vague results. Once defined, conduct a thorough feasibility study examining resources, timelines, risks, and required skills. Finally, create an emotional vision using sensory language that engages people's hearts as well as their minds.

**Quick Take**: Never proceed beyond Vision mode until you can confidently say the goal is both clearly defined and genuinely achievable.

### Plan Mode: Create Your Roadmap to Success
After establishing your vision, switch to Plan mode to develop a workable strategy. This mode requires addressing twelve critical planning considerations, from sequencing activities to identifying resources and setting milestones.

Effective planning isn't about perfection—it's about investing the minimum time needed to feel confident you can complete all steps correctly without rework. A credible plan becomes a motivational tool that builds both your and your team's belief in forthcoming success.

**Quick Take**: Good planning prevents poor performance and provides the confidence needed to lead effectively through implementation.

### Delegate Mode: Distribute Work Effectively
Delegate mode bridges planning and execution by dividing work into manageable chunks and assigning them to the right people. This requires careful consideration of individual capabilities, availability, and development needs.

Wyatt emphasizes that delegation should focus on objectives rather than methods—give people clear outcomes but let them determine how to achieve them. Always put delegated work in writing with explicit success criteria, timelines, and quality standards. Most importantly, maintain control through regular progress checks rather than abdicating responsibility.

**Quick Take**: Effective delegation balances clear direction with appropriate autonomy, ensuring everyone knows what to do, how to do it, when it's due, and what standard is expected.

### Enable Mode: Remove Barriers and Support Success
Switch to Enable mode when team members need support, resources, or guidance to execute their delegated tasks. This is where leaders "walk the floor"—spending time among frontline workers to understand real challenges and remove obstacles.

In Enable mode, leaders must learn, think, decide, and act quickly based on what they observe. This includes asking open questions, listening carefully, leading by example, and catching people doing things well. The goal is to ensure everyone has the skills, resources, and support needed to succeed.

> "If your actions inspire others to dream more, learn more, do more and become more, you are a leader."
> _John Quincy Adams_

**Quick Take**: Great enabling is about being present, proactive, and responsive—removing barriers before they become roadblocks.

### Empower Mode: Grant Freedom and Build Capability
Use Empower mode when team members are competent, confident, and working effectively together. This mode focuses on giving people operational freedom while maintaining appropriate oversight through scheduled progress reviews.

Empowerment requires demonstrating trust through confident language, providing safety nets for support, and recognizing individual differences in capability and need. Not everyone will be ready for equal empowerment, and not all projects allow for it due to complexity or rapid change.

**Quick Take**: True empowerment balances freedom with accountability—giving people space to prove themselves while ensuring you remain ultimately responsible for outcomes.
