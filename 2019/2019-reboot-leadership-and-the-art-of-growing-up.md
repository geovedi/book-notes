# Reboot: Leadership and the Art of Growing Up
**Author**: Jerry Colonna | **Year**: 2019
**Category**: Business & Finance

## Summary
"Reboot" presents a radical premise: better humans make better leaders, and the journey to effective leadership is fundamentally a journey of growing up. Colonna, a former venture capitalist turned CEO coach, argues that true leadership requires us to confront our childhood wounds, examine our core belief systems, and develop the emotional maturity to meet reality as it is rather than as we wish it were. Through vulnerable storytelling and practical wisdom, he shows how the challenges of leadership can become the very catalyst for our personal evolution.

This book serves entrepreneurs, CEOs, and leaders who find themselves feeling isolated, overwhelmed, or "stuck" despite external success. It offers a path to developing the inner resilience, authenticity, and self-awareness needed to lead effectively while becoming the adults we were meant to be.

## Core Insights

### Better Humans Make Better Leaders
Colonna's core thesis is that leadership development is inseparable from personal development. The book reveals that the qualities that make someone an effective leader—depth, resolve, congruency, and resilience—come from doing the hard work of growing up. Many leaders focus on acquiring external skills while ignoring the internal work that would enable them to show up fully and authentically. By embracing the demands of leadership as opportunities for personal growth, we can simultaneously become better leaders and better humans.

> "I believe that better humans make better leaders. I further believe that the process of learning to lead well can help us become better humans."

**Quick Take**: Your leadership effectiveness is limited by your personal maturity. The biggest lever for improving your leadership isn't learning new management techniques—it's growing as a person.

### Radical Self-Inquiry as the Path to Growth
The book introduces "radical self-inquiry" as the essential practice for leadership development. This involves honestly examining our core beliefs, childhood experiences, and emotional patterns without turning away. Colonna shows how our childhood survival strategies often become our leadership limitations, creating blind spots and reactive patterns that sabotage our effectiveness. Through compassionate self-examination, we can begin to see how we've been complicit in creating the conditions we say we don't want, and discover the freedom to choose differently.

> "This is radical self-inquiry. This is the practice of making the conscious choice to be in a relationship with the body we happen to be in."

**Quick Take**: Your leadership challenges often stem from unexamined childhood patterns. Regularly ask yourself: "What am I not saying that needs to be said?" and "How have I been complicit in creating the conditions I say I don't want?"

### Standing Still as a Strategic Advantage
In a world that worships constant motion and hustle, Colonna advocates for the counterintuitive power of standing still. Drawing from meditation practice and personal experience, he demonstrates how taking time to pause, reflect, and simply be allows us to access deeper wisdom and make more conscious choices. Many leaders remain stuck in reactive patterns because they never create the space to question their assumptions or listen to their inner wisdom. Standing still creates the conditions for breakthrough rather than breakdown.

> "The importance of standing still is to fully occupy the meat bag that is your body."

**Quick Take**: Schedule regular periods of reflection and stillness. Your best leadership insights will come not from doing more, but from being present with what is.

### The Warrior Stance: Meeting Reality as It Is
Colonna introduces the concept of the "warrior stance"—the courage to meet reality exactly as it is, without denial or delusion. This means acknowledging our mistakes, limitations, and fears without shame, while maintaining our commitment to lead with integrity. The warrior stance allows us to say, "Here I am, mess and all, do with me what you will." This vulnerability isn't weakness but the foundation of authentic leadership and the source of true resilience.

> "The warrior stance is the only true way to meet reality. The warrior stance creates the conditions in which our inner and outer begin to dance together."

**Quick Take**: Practice meeting challenges with openness rather than resistance. Ask in difficult moments: "What kind of leader am I right now?" and "What standards of dignity do I hold myself to, regardless of how things unfold?"

### Growing Up as the Ultimate Leadership Skill
The book argues that "growing up" is the most underrated yet essential leadership skill. This involves developing emotional regulation, taking responsibility for our impact on others, and learning to sit with discomfort rather than reacting impulsively. Colonna shows how leadership demands trigger our deepest fears and insecurities, offering repeated opportunities to develop adult capacities rather than remaining stuck in childlike reactions. True leadership maturity means recognizing when our "inner child" is driving our decisions and choosing to respond from adult wisdom instead.

**Quick Take**: Notice when you're reacting from past wounds rather than present reality. Ask: "What would the adult version of me do in this situation?"
