# 2019 Hydroponics Beginners Gardening Guide
**Authors**: Simon Hamilton | **Year**: 2019

## Summary
Hydroponics is a revolutionary soil-free growing system that can produce up to 6 times more crops than traditional farming while using only one-third of the water. This comprehensive beginner's guide transforms readers from complete novices to confident hydroponic gardeners by explaining the science behind water-based plant cultivation and providing practical steps for building five different system types.

This guide is perfect for urban dwellers with limited space, self-sustainability enthusiasts, and anyone wanting to grow fresh produce without pesticides. Whether you want to create a small herb garden in your apartment or eventually scale up to commercial farming, this book gives you the foundational knowledge to grow healthy plants efficiently.

## Core Insights

### Understanding Hydroponics: The Future of Food Production
Hydroponics replaces soil with nutrient-rich water solutions, allowing plants to grow 300% more efficiently than traditional farming. The system has been studied since the 17th century but gained popularity when William Frederick Gericke grew a 25-foot tomato plant using only water and nutrients in 1929. The term "hydroponics" comes from Greek roots meaning "water labor" - perfectly describing how plants work harder in water to produce extraordinary results.

> "What required 25,000 acres of soil in traditional farming, required only 1,300 acres of space with hydroponics in meeting the annual demand of tomatoes in Canada."
>
**Quick Take**: Hydroponics isn't just gardening—it's space and water optimization for the 21st century.

### Growing Mediums: The Foundation Without Soil
Plants need structural support even without soil, but growing mediums serve only as anchors—not nutrition providers. The best choice depends on your climate, crop type, and budget. Rockwool remains the most popular for beginners due to its versatility, while coconut fiber offers superior disease resistance and pH neutrality. Perlite and vermiculite work best when mixed together, creating the perfect balance of water retention and drainage.

> "Growing mediums are anything but soil because they don't provide any sustenance to the plant."
>
**Quick Take**: Your growing medium choice determines water management ease more than any other factor.

### Water Quality: The Hidden Success Factor
Not all water is created equal for hydroponics. Tap water requires dechlorination (24 hours of sunlight exposure breaks down chlorine) while hard water needs filtering or dilution. The magic number for most plants is pH 6.2-6.5—too acidic or alkaline water causes nutrient lockout, starving plants even when nutrients are present. Digital pH meters with automatic temperature compensation provide the most reliable monitoring for beginners.

> "If the water's pH drops to 5.5. The plant won't have trouble absorbing iron, but will encounter problems in absorbing nitrogen."
>
**Quick Take**: Perfect water chemistry beats expensive equipment every time.

### Nutrient Solutions: Plant Food in Scientific Precision
Hydroponic nutrients come in N-P-K ratios (Nitrogen-Phosphorus-Potassium) that must match plant growth stages. Seedlings need different formulas than fruiting plants. Liquid nutrients work best for beginners due to pre-mixed formulations and included pH buffers, while powdered nutrients offer economy for serious growers. The mixing sequence matters: add nutrients first, then test and adjust pH.

> "Unlike soil fertilizers, nutrient solutions are never an option in hydroponics gardening. You need these as much as you need the soil itself because this will feed your crops."
>
**Quick Take**: Nutrient management is hydroponics' biggest learning curve—but also its greatest advantage.

### System Selection: From Beginner to Advanced
Five main hydroponic systems exist, each with distinct advantages. The Wick system uses capillary action—perfect for lettuce and herbs with no electricity required. Water Culture submerges roots in oxygenated nutrient solution, ideal for heavy-feeding plants. Ebb and Flow systems flood and drain trays automatically, while Drip systems provide precise nutrient delivery. NFT (Nutrient Film Technique) pumps water continuously through tilted tubes for maximum efficiency.

> "Every beginner is advised to start their hydroponics career with the wick system... It's so easy, even school kids build their own."
>
**Quick Take**: Start simple, master the fundamentals, then advance to more complex systems.

## Best Quotes
- "In the current capitalistic economic system, the continuous and exponential growth of human population is generally favorable. It is, however, quite the opposite for the Earth itself."
- "The ideal agricultural system should be space and water efficient. Surprisingly, the answer isn't something that is yet to be invented or conceptualized."
- "Those who has one in their homes seldom rely on markets for fresh produce. And more importantly, they can assure that the food they eat have no harmful chemical-based pesticides and fertilizers used on them."
- "Soil gardening is easy. All you would need for a simple one are a pot, a bag of soil, a couple of seeds, lots of sunshine and regular watering. Hydroponics, on the other hand, is a lot more complicated."
- "The next step is to go and create your own. As mentioned, you don't need to pour in loads of cash just to start one. Simple items lying around the house is enough to build a wick system."

## Essential Equipment
- **pH testing kit**: Liquid kits offer the best balance of accuracy and affordability for beginners
- **Digital pH meter**: Worth the investment for serious growers—choose one with automatic temperature compensation
- **Air pump and stone**: Essential for Water Culture systems to provide dissolved oxygen
- **Growing medium**: Start with rockwool cubes for seedlings, then experiment with coconut fiber or perlite/vermiculite mix
- **Opaque containers**: Prevent algae growth by blocking sunlight from nutrient solutions

## Questions to Consider
- What plants do you want to grow, and what are their specific water and nutrient requirements?
- How much space can you realistically dedicate to your hydroponic system?
- Are you prepared for the daily monitoring and adjustment that hydroponics requires?
- What's your budget—can you start with simple materials before investing in professional equipment?
- How will you handle potential setbacks like nutrient deficiencies or equipment failures?

## Conclusion
This book delivers exactly what it promises—a comprehensive foundation for hydroponic gardening success. Hamilton's approach balances scientific precision with practical accessibility, making complex concepts understandable for complete beginners. The step-by-step system explanations, from simple Wick setups to advanced NFT configurations, provide a clear progression path for growers to advance their skills.

What makes this guide exceptional is its emphasis on understanding the "why" behind hydroponic principles rather than just following instructions. By teaching readers about water chemistry, nutrient science, and plant biology, Hamilton equips gardeners to troubleshoot problems independently rather than depending on rigid formulas.

The biggest reason to read this book is its empowerment message—you don't need expensive equipment or advanced degrees to grow food hydroponically. With common household items and the knowledge from these pages, anyone can start producing fresh, pesticide-free produce regardless of their living situation. For anyone interested in sustainable food production, urban gardening, or simply wanting to understand this revolutionary growing method, this book provides the perfect starting point.
