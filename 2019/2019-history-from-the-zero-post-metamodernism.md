# History from the Zero: Post Metamodernism
**Original Title**: История из Нуля. Постметамодернизм
**Author**: Viktoriia Managarova | **Year**: 2019
**Category**: Philosophy & Critical Thinking

## Summary
This philosophical essay presents a bold vision for moving beyond postmodernism's void of meaning through what the author calls "post metamodernism." Managarova argues that humanity has reached a "zero state" - a condition of total indifference where traditional values, meaning, and even the distinction between good and evil have collapsed. By analyzing the trajectory from modernism through postmodernism to the emerging metamodernism, she proposes that humanity stands at the threshold of a "Brilliant Age" where goodness can exist without evil, and where binary oppositions that have caused human suffering can finally be transcended.

This work will benefit readers interested in contemporary philosophy, cultural theory, and future visions of human society. Those grappling with questions about meaning in our postmodern world, or seeking alternatives to nihilism and cultural relativism, will find here a provocative framework for understanding our current moment and imagining what might come next.

## Core Insights

### The Great End in Postmodern State
Postmodernism created what Managarova calls the "zero state" - a condition of total indifference where traditional values collapsed and differences between past and future, good and evil, plus and minus were erased. This state emerged through the deconstruction of "grand narratives," the breakdown of meaning, and the creation of what Jean Baudrillard called "the transparency of evil." In this condition, love lost its sources and the world divided into a state of unlimited "emptiness," where nothing could be valued or judged as beautiful or ugly, true or false.

**Quick Take**: Postmodernism didn't just critique modern values - it created a vacuum where meaningful human experience became nearly impossible, leading to what Herbert Marcuse called the "One-Dimensional Man."

### Metamodernism's Both-Neither Dynamic
In the early 21st century, "New Sincerity" emerged as a response to postmodern irony, creating what Timotheus Vermeulen and Robin van den Akker call the "both-neither" dynamic of metamodernism. This new paradigm oscillates between modernist sincerity and postmodern irony, between hope and melancholy, between engagement and detachment. However, the metamodern person remains trapped in what Managarova calls the "crisis of dominants" - unable to make final choices or recognize life's core values because they're bound by memory of binary oppositions.

> _Original: "Metamodernism displaces the parameters of the present with those of a future presence that is futureless"_

**Quick Take**: Metamodernism represents progress beyond postmodern nihilism but remains incomplete because it cannot fully escape the binary logic that has governed Western thought for centuries.

### The Light Man and Reality Without Binary Fights
Managarova's vision for post metamodernism centers on what she calls the "Light Man" - a new human consciousness that can exist within the "shades of light" without evil. This represents a fundamental shift from binary oppositions (good vs. evil, love vs. hate, truth vs. falsehood) to a unified field of goodness. The Light Man experiences true freedom and happiness because they're no longer caught in the endless oscillations that have characterized human consciousness. This state allows for what she calls the "World Paradise" - not a utopian afterlife, but a living paradise on Earth.

> _Original: "It makes sense only that you've created by your own hand. No one can defile your calm — the transparency of its lines. The world is white! There are no bars of dark in it!"_

**Quick Take**: True freedom comes not from choosing between opposites but from transcending the binary framework entirely and existing within a field of pure goodness.

### The First Commandment of God
The foundation of post metamodernism, according to Managarova, is returning to what she identifies as God's first and only commandment: "not to know anything except Goodness in Paradise forever." This principle suggests that the fundamental error of human consciousness has been the acceptance of evil as a necessary counterpart to good. By rejecting this binary logic and embracing only goodness, humanity can reconcile warring monotheistic religions and overcome the atheistic reaction to religious hypocrisy that has characterized modern thought.

> "Goodness cannot be mixed with evil. Goodness cannot be opposed to evil. And in this lies is the greatest mistake of humanity of all times"
> _Original: "Goodness cannot be mixed with evil. Goodness cannot be opposed to evil. And in this lies is the greatest mistake of humanity of all times"_

**Quick Take**: The solution to humanity's philosophical crisis isn't creating better arguments or finding new values - it's rejecting the binary framework that makes opposition and conflict inevitable.

## Action Items
- Recognize when you're caught in binary thinking (good/bad, right/wrong, success/failure)
- Practice seeing situations through the lens of "shades of goodness" rather than opposition
- Question whether conflicts in your life stem from accepting binary frameworks as inevitable
- Cultivate the "Light Man" consciousness by focusing on unity rather than opposition
- Look for examples of post metamodern thinking in art, culture, and philosophy

## Questions to Consider
- What would it mean to live without the concept of evil as a counterbalance to good?
- How might your relationships change if you stopped seeing them in terms of oppositions?
- Can you imagine a society where laws and institutions are based on unity rather than conflict resolution?
- What aspects of current culture already point toward post metamodern thinking?
- How might rejecting binary logic transform your understanding of spiritual or philosophical questions?

## Conclusion
This is a challenging but rewarding philosophical work that dares to imagine what comes after our current cultural moment of uncertainty and transition. Managarova's vision of post metamodernism offers a genuinely original perspective on humanity's current predicament and a hopeful alternative to both postmodern nihilism and metamodern hesitation. While some readers may find her rejection of binary logic radical or her religious framing challenging, the core insight - that human suffering often stems from accepting oppositions as necessary rather than transcending them - provides a powerful tool for understanding our current moment.

The biggest reason to engage with this work is its大胆 proposal that we're not stuck in endless cycles of cultural criticism and reconstruction. Instead, Managarova suggests we're at the threshold of a fundamental transformation in human consciousness - one that could resolve age-old conflicts about meaning, value, and purpose. Whether or not you accept her specific framework, this book will expand your thinking about what's possible beyond the paradigms that currently limit our imagination.
