# Old Stones of the Cotswolds and Forest of Dean
**Original Title**: Old Stones of the Cotswolds & Forest of Dean
**Author**: D.P. Sullivan | **Year**: 2019
**Category**: History & Biography

## Summary
This comprehensive survey explores the ancient megalithic stones scattered across Gloucestershire's Cotswolds and Forest of Dean regions. While the county appears sparse in prehistoric monuments on official maps, the reality reveals a rich legacy of standing stones, lost megaliths, boundary markers, and sacred rocks that have shaped the landscape for millennia. Sullivan combines archaeological research with local folklore, earth mysteries theories, and personal field investigations to document 41 stone sites, many of which have been lost, destroyed, or repurposed over centuries.

The book bridges scientific investigation with mystical interpretation, examining how these stones may have served multiple purposes throughout history—as ley markers, boundary stones, healing sites, and ceremonial centers. It's an essential guide for anyone interested in Britain's hidden archaeological heritage and the enduring mysteries surrounding these ancient monuments.

## Core Insights

### The Hidden Megalithic Landscape
Gloucestershire conceals a far richer prehistoric stone heritage than officially recognized. While Ordnance Survey maps show few standing stones, the county actually contains dozens of megaliths, many lost or destroyed over centuries. These include standing stones from long barrows, natural boulders adopted as markers, and stones deliberately erected for unknown purposes. The author's systematic survey reveals how agricultural activity, road construction, and deliberate destruction have erased much of this heritage, leaving only fragments and historical records.

> "The reality, however, is a legacy of many monoliths, lost megaliths, forgotten mark stones, boundary stones, once venerated natural rocks and ancient milestones scattered all over the county."
**Quick Take**: Britain's ancient heritage is far richer than maps suggest—many sacred stones have been lost to "progress" but their memory survives in place names and local traditions.

### Ley Lines and Earth Energy
The book explores Alfred Watkins' "ley line" theory, proposing that standing stones marked prehistoric straight-track trading routes across country. D.P. Sullivan investigates how these alignments connected prominent topographical features and served as navigational aids for ancient travelers. More intriguingly, the author examines dowsers' claims that these stones mark confluence points of underground streams ("blind springs") and terrestrial energy lines, possibly used for shamanic rituals or consciousness-altering practices.

> "It has been suggested that prehistoric man was aware of these forces and marked their location with sacred structures such as stone circles and standing stones."
**Quick Take**: Ancient peoples may have possessed sophisticated knowledge of earth energies that we're only beginning to rediscover through modern scientific investigation.

### Healing Stones and Folk Traditions
Many Gloucestershire stones were associated with healing powers, particularly "holed stones" through which people—especially children—were passed to cure various ailments. The Long Stone at Minchinhampton was famous for curing rickets and smallpox, while others were believed to cure rheumatism through crawling through the holes. The book documents how Christian authorities eventually suppressed these practices, associating the old stones with devil worship and pagan rituals.

> "In the past mothers were wont to pass their rickety children through the hole in the stone in the belief that they would be cured of the condition."
**Quick Take**: Modern medicine dismisses these practices as superstition, but the persistence of healing traditions across cultures suggests they may have psychological or physiological benefits.

### Scientific Investigation of Ancient Sites
The Dragon Project, mentioned in the book, represents one of the first systematic scientific investigations into claims of anomalous energies at sacred sites. Using geomagnetometers and other instruments, researchers detected measurable electromagnetic fluctuations at stones like the Long Stone. More fascinatingly, these readings appeared to change in response to human presence and intention, suggesting complex interactions between people, stones, and environmental energies.

> "As we left our cars and approached the Long Stone the geomagnetometer gave fairly high fluctuating readings; higher than average readings I had experienced back at the Stroud conference centre, earlier that day."
**Quick Take**: What ancient peoples called "magic" may have been sophisticated understanding of natural electromagnetic phenomena that we can now measure with modern instruments.

### Boundary Stones and Legal Functions
Many standing stones were adopted by later cultures to define territorial boundaries. The book shows how ancient megaliths, originally erected for unknown purposes, became convenient markers for Saxon land charters and parish boundaries. Stones like the Kiftsgate Stone served as moot places where local communities gathered to administer justice, hold festivals, and conduct tribal business. This demonstrates how sacred sites often retained their significance even as cultures and religions changed around them.

> "Kifts is thought to derive from Old English cyft meaning meeting, conference, hence Kiftsgate could mean gate or gap where meetings are held."
**Quick Take**: Sacred places maintain their power across millennia—what was once a pagan ritual site might become a Christian boundary marker or medieval meeting place.
