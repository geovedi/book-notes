## Fast-Track Story Guide

### The Christmas Journey Begins
Mrs. Brown (née Thompson) is determined to bring her reluctant husband Charles to the annual Thompson family Christmas gathering at Thompson Hall. After years of spending Christmas in France, this particular gathering is especially important as it's meant to introduce her sister Jane's new fiancé to the extended family. Mr. Brown, complaining of throat ailments and the harsh winter weather, reluctantly agrees to travel but makes their journey as difficult as possible.

> "She had ever been meetings of the Thompsons at Thompson Hall, though meetings not so significant, not so important to the family, as this one which was now to be collected."
> _Original: English_

### The Mustard Mishap
Arriving in Paris during brutal winter weather, Mr. Brown claims to be deathly ill and begs his wife to fetch mustard from the hotel salon to make a plaster for his throat. Mrs. Brown, initially skeptical of her husband's complaints but moved by his apparent suffering, embarks on a midnight quest through the hotel's labyrinthine corridors.

> "If she could manage to find her way down there, taking with her a handkerchief folded for the purpose, and if she could then appropriate a part of the contents of that jar, and, returning with her prize, apply it to his throat, he thought that he could get some relief"
> _Original: English_

### The Mistaken Identity
In the darkness and confusion of the unfamiliar hotel, Mrs. Brown enters room 353 instead of 333. Finding a sleeping man who resembles her husband (both have long brown beards), she applies the mustard plaster to his throat, only to realize her horrible mistake when she sees a stranger's face in the candlelight. Panicked and horrified, she flees without removing the plaster or waking the man.

> "Never had she been more conscious of the grand proportions of that manly throat. A sweet feeling of pity came upon her, causing her to determine to relieve his sufferings in the shorter space of fifteen minutes... She dropped the beard very softly—and there on the pillow before her lay the face of a stranger. She had put the mustard plaster on the wrong man."

### The Morning After
The Browns' attempt to flee Paris is thwarted when the night porter discovers Mrs. Brown's monogrammed handkerchief in the injured stranger's room. The gentleman, Mr. Barnaby Jones, refuses to believe the story was accidental and insists on satisfaction. Despite Mr. Brown's best efforts to smooth things over, the family is forced to take the evening train, missing their planned Christmas Eve arrival.

> "It has been just as bad to me, sir. We were to have been with our family this Christmas-eve. There were particular reasons—most particular. We were only hindered from going by hearing of your condition."
> _Original: English_

### The Christmas Reunion
The most delightful twist occurs when Mr. Jones also arrives at Thompson Hall for Christmas - he is Charles Burnaby Jones, the fiancé of Mrs. Brown's sister Jane. The stranger she inadvertently mustard-plastered is to become her brother-in-law. After initial awkwardness and Mr. Jones's continued suspicion that it was a deliberate prank, the story is finally explained to the family and forgiveness prevails.

> "Mr. Charles Burnaby Jones—for such was his name since he had inherited the Jones property in Pembrokeshire—received into his arms the ardent girl of his heart with all that love and devotion to which she was entitled, but could not do so without some external shrinking from her embrace."
> _Original: English_
