# Anne of Green Gables Collection
**Authors**: Lucy Maud Montgomery | **Year**: 1908-1917

## Summary
The Anne of Green Gables Collection follows the remarkable journey of Anne Shirley, a fiery red-haired orphan with an imagination as vast as the Prince Edward Island landscapes she calls home. Beginning with her accidental adoption by the elderly Cuthbert siblings at Green Gables, the collection spans Anne's transformation from a dreamy, talkative child to a determined teacher, accomplished student, and eventually a wife and mother.

This beloved series captures Anne's adventures through four core novels: Anne's arrival and adjustment to Green Gables, her teaching career at Avonlea school, her college years at Redmond, and the building of her own home at Four Winds Point. Alongside her loyal "bosom friend" Diana Barry and a cast of memorable Avonlea characters, Anne navigates childhood scrapes, academic triumphs, romantic dilemmas, and the profound losses that shape her coming-of-age.

Readers who appreciate heartfelt coming-of-age stories, rich descriptions of nature, and characters who find beauty in everyday moments will treasure this collection. It's especially perfect for those who believe in the power of imagination, the importance of found family, and the magic of finding your place in the world.

## Core Insights

### The Transformative Power of Imagination
Anne's greatest gift and initial burden is her vivid imagination. As an orphan, she escapes harsh realities through elaborate daydreams, renaming ordinary places with romantic names like "The Snow Queen" for a cherry tree and "The White Way of Delight" for a simple road. While initially viewed as problematic by practical Marilla, Anne's imagination becomes her superpower—helping her see beauty others miss, find creative solutions to problems, and inspire those around her.

### Found Family Transforms Lives
The Cuthberts' decision to keep Anne after expecting a boy demonstrates that family isn't about biology, but about commitment and love.
