The eldest sister who shoulders maternal responsibilities while longing for the finer things in life. Meg's journey from vanity and materialism to finding true happiness in simplicity and love represents the classic path from girlhood to mature womanhood.

Sweet, shy, and musically gifted, Beth embodies pure kindness and selflessness. Her tragic illness serves as the emotional core of the novel, teaching profound lessons about love, sacrifice, and finding beauty in life's simple moments.

### Amy - The Artist with Ambition
The youngest sister, artistic and socially conscious, who dreams of wealth and status. Her evolution from spoiled girl to refined woman demonstrates the complexities of growing into oneself while navigating social expectations.

## Key Turning Points

### The Christmas Sacrifice
The novel opens with the sisters learning to find happiness without material possessions, establishing the theme that true wealth lies in family love and personal character rather than material comfort.

As each sister faces adulthood—through marriage, career choices, or personal tragedy—their individual paths reflect different approaches to finding fulfillment in a restrictive society.

### Finding Purpose Beyond the Home
The sisters' diverse journeys—from Meg's domestic happiness to Jo's literary career and Amy's artistic ambitions—demonstrate that womanhood can take many forms and that personal fulfillment comes from authentic self-expression.
