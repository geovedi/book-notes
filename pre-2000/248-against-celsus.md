# Against Celsus
**Original Title**: 驳塞尔修斯
**Author**: Origen (奥利金) | **Year**: c. 248 CE 

## Summary
"Against Celsus" is Origen's monumental defense of Christianity against the most sophisticated pagan critique of the ancient world. Written around 248 CE, this eight-volume work systematically responds to Celsus's "The True Doctrine" (真教义), which attacked Christianity from philosophical, social, and religious perspectives. Celsus had argued that Christianity was a dangerous superstition that undermined Roman society, borrowed foolish ideas from "barbarians," and appealed only to the ignorant and weak.

Origen transforms Celsus's attack into an opportunity to articulate Christian theology with unprecedented depth and sophistication. He demonstrates that Christianity represents not a rejection of reason and philosophy, but its fulfillment. Origen shows remarkable intellectual honesty, engaging Celsus's arguments seriously while revealing their philosophical inconsistencies and prejudices. The work stands as both a masterful example of classical apologetics and a profound contribution to Christian philosophical theology.

This book is essential reading for anyone interested in early Christian thought, the relationship between faith and reason, or how religious traditions respond to criticism. Readers will gain insight into how early Christians understood their faith in relation to Greek philosophy, Judaism, and Roman culture.

## Core Insights

### The Divine Nature and True Philosophy
Origen argues that Celsus fundamentally misunderstands both Christian doctrine and genuine philosophy. While Celsus accuses Christians of abandoning traditional wisdom, Origen demonstrates that Christianity preserves the highest philosophical truths about God's nature – that God is eternal, unchangeable, incorporeal, and perfectly good. Unlike the Greek philosophers who often compromised these truths, Christianity maintains them consistently.

> "The Jewish and Christian doctrine protects God's unchangeable, eternal nature, yet is considered impious simply because it conflicts with those who hold impious views about God!"
> _Original: "犹太人和基督徒的教义保护上帝不变、永恒的本性，却被认为是不敬神的，不就是因为这一教义与那些坚持对上帝持不敬观点的人不一致嘛！"_

**Quick Take**: True philosophy isn't about clever arguments but about aligning our understanding with divine reality, however challenging that may be to human comprehension.

### The Wisdom of the Nations and God's Universal Revelation
Origen challenges Celsus's claim that Christianity represents merely "barbarian" wisdom by showing how God has revealed truth to all nations, not just Greeks. While acknowledging that different cultures possess partial insights, he argues that Christianity represents the fullest and most accurate revelation of divine truth. This doesn't reject wisdom from other cultures but fulfills and perfects it.

> "If what Moses heard were indeed wise and true theories, which he accepted and passed on to his people, what fault can be found with him?"
> _Original: "但如果如你所说的，他接受了智慧而真实的理论，拿它们来教育自己的百姓，那他有什么可指责的？"_

**Quick Take**: Divine truth transcends cultural boundaries, though different cultures may grasp it with varying degrees of clarity and completeness.

### The Problem of Secret Societies and Higher Loyalty
When Celsus criticizes Christians for forming "illegal secret societies," Origen offers a brilliant defense that raises profound questions about the limits of political authority. He argues that when human laws conflict with divine law, loyalty to God must take precedence, using the analogy of citizens who secretly oppose tyrants to save their cities.

> "Just as citizens who secretly unite to kill the tyrant ruling their city act righteously, so Christians who unite against the devil—who reigns like a tyrant—and his laws are acting righteously to save others."
> _Original: "正如百姓秘密联合起来杀死掌控他们城市的暴君是义行，同样，既然魔鬼——如基督徒所称呼的——和谬误像暴君一样做了王，基督徒违背魔鬼的法律联合起来反对他，以便拯救其他人，说服他们抛弃如同斯基台人的和暴君的法律的那种法律，这也是义行。"_

**Quick Take**: Community bonds founded on shared divine loyalty transcend and sometimes rightly oppose earthly authorities that demand ultimate allegiance.

### The Power of Divine Names and Spiritual Reality
In fascinating passages that reveal early Christian understanding of spiritual warfare, Origen discusses how divine names carry inherent power when properly used. He argues that the Hebrew names for God aren't merely cultural conventions but connect to real spiritual authority, distinguishing them from pagan names that merely reference created spirits or demons.

> "The names Sabaoth, Adonai, and all other names handed down with great reverence by the Hebrews relate not to ordinary created things but to the mysterious and divine science concerning the Creator of the universe."
> _Original: "万军之耶和华（Saba-oth）、我的主（Adonai），以及所有其他希伯来人以极大的敬意传下来的名字，都与通常的被造物无关，而与关于宇宙造主的神秘而神圣的学科有关。"_

**Quick Take**: Language and names can carry spiritual reality beyond mere cultural convention, connecting human speakers to divine authority and power.

## Conclusion

"Against Celsus" represents a masterpiece of early Christian thought that remains remarkably relevant today. Origen demonstrates that robust faith doesn't fear intelligent criticism but engages it seriously, using it as an opportunity for deeper theological reflection. His approach combines intellectual rigor with spiritual depth, showing how faith and reason can be complementary rather than opposed.

This book is worth reading not just for its historical significance but for its timeless insights into the relationship between faith and reason, individual conviction and community, spiritual loyalty and political authority. Origen's method of engaging criticism with both intellectual honesty and unwavering commitment offers a model for how religious traditions can participate in philosophical dialogue without compromising their essential beliefs.

The biggest reason to read this work is its demonstration of how ancient Christianity could engage the best of pagan philosophy on its own terms while maintaining its distinctive claims. In an age of increasing polarization between religious and secular worldviews, Origen shows us a path forward—neither retreating into defensive isolation nor surrendering to hostile critiques, but engaging thoughtfully with the best arguments against our position while speaking truth in love.
