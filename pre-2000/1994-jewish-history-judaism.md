# Jewish History, Judaism, and the Weight of Three Millennia
**Original Title**: Storia ebraica e giudaismo: Il peso di tre millenni
**Author**: Israel Shahak | **Year**: 1994 

## Summary
"Jewish History, Judaism, and the Weight of Three Millennia" is a provocative study examining how religious orthodoxy has shaped Israel's secular state with what the author describes as an "odious and disastrous nature." Shahak, a Holocaust survivor and human rights activist, argues that while Islamic fundamentalism is widely condemned in the West, Jewish fundamentalism passes largely unnoticed despite being used to justify Israeli policies that are "racist, totalitarian, and xenophobic" as much as the worst antisemitism.

The book investigates Talmudic and rabbinical laws to understand what Shahak identifies as the roots of Jewish chauvinism and religious fanaticism, particularly in attitudes toward non-Jews ("gentiles"). Through extensive analysis of classical Jewish texts, Shahak contends that traditional Judaism contains discriminatory principles that continue to influence contemporary Israeli politics and society.

This controversial work serves as a critique of religious fundamentalism from within, challenging both external perceptions of Judaism and internal Jewish self-understanding. It's particularly relevant for readers interested in Middle Eastern politics, religious studies, and critical examinations of how ancient religious laws affect modern state policies.

## Core Insights

### The Dual Nature of Jewish Identity
Shahak argues that "Judaism" actually defines two conflicting social groups. On one hand is traditional totalitarianism based on classical Jewish law (Halakhah), and on the other are Jews who have internalized what Karl Popper called "the open society" principles. This division explains why many stereotypical "Jewish characteristics" are actually modern developments unknown in Jewish history until the community began losing its totalitarian power of life and death over its members.

The author contends that many Jews today feel nostalgia for what he calls a "paradise lost" - a convenient closed society from which they were not liberated but expelled. A vast sector of the Zionist movement has dreamed of reconstructing this world, and this sector has achieved hegemony in modern Israel.

> "All the so-called 'Jewish characteristics'—those traits that Western intellectuals attribute to their so-called 'Jews'—are modern characteristics, unknown in Jewish history and appeared when the totalitarian community began to lose its power of life and death."
> _Original: "Tutte le cosiddette 'caratteristiche ebraiche' – quei tratti che i cosiddetti intellettuali dell'Occidente attribuiscono ai loro cosiddetti 'ebrei' – sono caratteristiche moderne, sconosciute nella storia ebraica e apparse quando la comunità totalitaria cominciò a perdere il suo potere di vita e di morte."_

**Quick Take**: The book challenges common assumptions about Jewish continuity, suggesting that many supposedly ancient Jewish traditions are actually modern responses to changing social conditions.

### Historical Censorship and Deception
Shahak documents how Jewish authorities systematically modified or censored offensive Talmudic passages when under external pressure, only to restore them when safe. This practice, which he calls "the hidden challenge as the basis for outward deference," involved replacing terms like "gentile" or "non-Jew" with euphemisms like "idolaters," "pagans," or "Canaanites" that Jewish readers would recognize as substitutions.

The author provides specific examples, including how Maimonide's codification of Jewish law was translated into English with significant softening of passages calling for the extermination of Jewish "heretics." The original Hebrew text states "It is the duty of every believer to exterminate them with his own hands," while the English translation reads "It is a duty to take all necessary measures to destroy them."

> "Forced by external pressures, the rabbins eliminated or modified certain passages but not the prescriptions they contained. It is a fact that must be remembered, by Jews first of all, that for centuries our totalitarian society has used barbaric and inhuman customs to poison the minds of its members and that this continues even today."
> _Original: "Costretti dalle pressioni esterne, i rabbini eliminarono o modificarono certi passi ma non certo le prescrizioni che contenevano. È un fatto che deve essere ricordato, dagli ebrei per primi, che per secoli la nostra società totalitaria si è servita di costumi barbarici e disumani per avvelenare le menti dei suoi membri e che questo continua anche oggi."_

**Quick Take**: The systematic concealment of problematic texts has created a gap between how Judaism presents itself to outsiders and how it functions internally, particularly regarding attitudes toward non-Jews.

### Legal Discrimination in Classical Jewish Law
The book extensively analyzes Halakhic (Jewish law) principles that create different obligations toward Jews versus non-Jews. Shahak documents how, according to classical Jewish sources, there is no duty to save the life of a non-Jew, and in fact it may be forbidden to do so. Maimonide explicitly states: "As for the gentiles with whom we are not at war [...] we must not cause their death, but it is forbidden to save them if we see they are in danger of death."

This extends to medical ethics. According to Shahak, traditional Jewish law forbids Jewish doctors from treating non-Jewish patients, except when there's a real danger of hostility that could harm Jews. The primary motivation for treating non-Jews, according to these sources, is to avoid danger rather than genuine humanitarian concern.

> "For as for the gentiles with whom we are not at war [...] we must not cause their death, but it is forbidden to save them if we see they are in danger of life. If, for example, we see that a gentile has fallen into the sea, we must do nothing to save him because it is written: 'you shall not shed the blood of your friend' and the gentiles are not at all our friends."
> _Original: "Per quanto riguarda i gentili con i quali non siamo in guerra […] non si deve provocarne la morte ma è vietato salvarli se vediamo che sono in pericolo di vita. Se, per esempio, si vede che un gentile è caduto in mare, non si deve nulla per salvarlo perché è scritto: 'non spargerai il sangue del tuo amico' e i gentili non sono affatto nostri amici."_

**Quick Take**: Classical Jewish law creates a legal hierarchy that places Jewish lives and interests above those of non-Jews, with significant implications for how religious Jews interact with broader society.

### Contemporary Political Implications
Shahak argues that these ancient legal principles directly influence modern Israeli politics and policies. He documents how extremist religious movements like Chabad-Lubavitch teach that non-Jews are "absolutely satanic creatures who have nothing good in them" and that non-Jewish existence is "inessential" since all creation is intended "in function of the Jews."

The book cites specific instances where these attitudes translated into policy, including attempts to persuade Jewish doctors and nurses not to treat "gentile wounded" before Israel's 1978 invasion of Lebanon. Shahak notes that multiple Israeli prime ministers, including Menachem Begin, sought the support of these extremist religious leaders despite their racist views.

> "The existence of non-Jews is 'inessential,' since all creation is destined 'in function of the Jews.'"
> _Original: "L'esistenza dei non ebrei è 'inessenziale', visto che tutto il creato è destinato 'in funzione degli ebrei'."_

**Quick Take**: Religious extremism in Israel is not marginal but has significant influence on government policy and military operations, potentially violating both Israeli and international law.
