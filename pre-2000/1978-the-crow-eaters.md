The novel masterfully shows how immigrants must balance preserving their cultural identity while adapting to new environments.

### Parsi Community and Identity

### Family Dynamics and Generational Conflict
The complex relationship between Freddy and his mother-in-law Jerbanoo drives much of the novel's comedy and drama.

### Pre-Partition Cosmopolitanism
