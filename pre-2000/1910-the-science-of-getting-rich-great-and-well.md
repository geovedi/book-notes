# The Science of Getting Rich, Great and Well
**Authors**: Wallace D. Wattles | **Year**: 1910

## Summary
This collection contains three foundational works in the New Thought movement: "The Science of Getting Rich," "The Science of Being Great," and "The Science of Being Well." Wattles presents a unified philosophy that material success, personal greatness, and physical health are not separate pursuits but interconnected aspects of a complete life. He argues that there's a "thinking stuff" (Formless Substance) from which all things are made, and that humans can shape their reality through directed thought, gratitude, and purposeful action.

For anyone seeking a practical framework for personal transformation, these books provide a systematic approach to manifesting wealth, achieving greatness, and maintaining health through mental and spiritual principles rather than mere chance or hard work alone.

## Core Insights

### The Science of Getting Rich
Getting rich is an exact science governed by universal laws, not luck or environment. When you learn and apply these laws, wealth becomes mathematically certain. The key is shifting from competitive to creative mindsets, understanding that the universe desires your abundance and that opportunities are unlimited.

> "There is a Science of getting rich, and it is an exact science, like algebra or arithmetic. There are certain laws which govern the process of acquiring riches; once these laws are learned and obeyed by any man, he will get rich with mathematical certainty."

**Quick Take**: Focus on creating value rather than competing for limited resources. The universe is abundant and wants you to succeed.

### The Power of Thought and Mental Images
Your thoughts literally create your reality. By forming clear, definite mental pictures of what you want and maintaining unwavering faith that you already possess them, you impress these desires upon the "Formless Substance" that brings things into existence.

> "A thought in this substance produces the thing that is imaged by the thought. Man can form things in his thought, and by impressing his thought upon formless substance can cause the thing he thinks about to be created."

**Quick Take**: Be specific about what you want, visualize it clearly, and act as if you already have it.

### The Role of Gratitude
Gratitude is the essential connection between your mind and the Formless Intelligence. It puts you in harmony with the creative forces of the universe and accelerates the manifestation process. Thank God for what you want as if you already have it.

> "Man may come into full harmony with the Formless Substance by entertaining a lively and sincere gratitude for the blessings it bestows upon him. Gratitude unifies the mind of man with the intelligence of Substance."

**Quick Take**: Practice gratefulness for future blessings as if they're already present in your life.

### Acting in the Certain Way
Thought alone is insufficient - you must act efficiently and purposefully in the present. Success comes from doing each day what can be done that day, with excellence, while keeping your vision firmly in mind.

> "The answer to prayer is not according to your faith while you are talking, but according to your faith while you are working."

**Quick Take**: Combine vision with immediate, efficient action. Do your best work now while holding your future goals in mind.

### The Science of Being Great
Greatness isn't about talent or birthright - it's about consciously developing your inherent Principle of Power. Every person has genius within them, and through self-activity and conscious growth, anyone can become great in their own unique way.

> "There is a Principle of Power in every person. By the intelligent use and direction of this principle, man can develop his own mental faculties. Man has an inherent power by which he may grow in whatever direction he pleases, and there does not appear to be any limit to the possibilities of his growth."

**Quick Take**: You have unlimited potential for growth. Direct your inner power toward conscious development rather than reacting to circumstances.

### The Science of Being Well
Health is natural and your birthright. By focusing on health principles rather than disease, maintaining faith in your wellbeing, and harmonizing with the universal Principle of Life, you can achieve and maintain perfect health.

> "The Principle of Health in a person, when in full constructive activity, causes all the voluntary functions of his life to be performed perfectly, and the source of all the involuntary functions is a limitless reservoir of energy and life."

**Quick Take**: Focus on health thinking, not disease thinking. Trust your body's natural tendency toward perfect health.
