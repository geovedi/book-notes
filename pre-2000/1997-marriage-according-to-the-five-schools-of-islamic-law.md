**Author**: Muhammad Jawad Maghniyyah | **Year**: 1997

## Summary
This comprehensive comparative study examines Islamic marriage laws across five major schools of Islamic jurisprudence - Hanafi, Hanbali, Shafi'i, Maliki, and Ja'fari - providing detailed analysis of their similarities and differences on marriage-related issues. As the fifth volume in an eight-part series on Islamic Shariah, this work offers scholars and practitioners an authoritative reference for understanding how different Islamic legal traditions interpret and apply marriage regulations.

The book serves as an essential resource for Islamic law students, legal scholars, marriage counselors, and anyone seeking to understand the diversity within Islamic legal thought regarding marriage contracts, rights, obligations, and contemporary issues like artificial insemination.

## Core Insights

### The Marriage Contract Framework
The five schools unanimously agree that marriage requires a formal contract with specific recitations, but differ significantly on procedural details. The contract must contain an offer (from the bride or her representative) using words like "ankatu" or "zawwajtu" (I have married) and acceptance (from the groom) using "qabiltu" (I accept) or "raditu" (I agree).

- **Hanafi School**: Most flexible, accepting any words conveying marriage intention, even from roots like al-tamlik (ownership) or al-hibah (gift), provided they indicate marriage purpose
- **Maliki & Hanbali Schools**: Accept words from al-nikah and al-zawaj roots, plus al-hibah (gift) when dower amount is specified
- **Shafi'i School**: Requires strict use of derivatives from al-zawaj or al-nikah roots
- **Ja'fari (Imamiyyah) School**: Most stringent, requiring past tense verbs specifically from al-zawaj and al-nikah roots

> "A mere agreement without the recital of the contract does not amount to marriage."
> _Original: "A mere agreement without the recital of the contract does not amount to marriage."_
**Quick Take**: The formal contract recitation is non-negotiable across all schools, but flexibility in wording varies significantly by legal tradition.

### Witness Requirements and Contract Validity
Witness requirements demonstrate another major divergence among the schools, reflecting different approaches to legal proof and social validation:

- **Shafi'i, Hanafi, Hanbali**: Require witnesses at contract time (two men, or one man and two women for Hanafis)
- **Maliki**: Witnesses not required at contract but essential at consummation
- **Ja'fari**: Consider witnesses recommended (mustababb) but not obligatory

> "According to the Malikis, the presence of witnesses is not necessary at the time of the contract but their presence is necessary at the time when marriage is to be consummated."
> _Original: "According to the Malikis, the presence of witnesses is not necessary at the time of the contract but their presence is necessary at the time when marriage is to be consummated."_
**Quick Take**: The timing and necessity of witnesses reflects each school's balance between legal formalism and practical considerations.

### Prohibited Relationships and Marriage Restrictions
All schools concur on seven categories of female relatives prohibited for marriage based on consanguinity, affinity, and fosterage, but differ on specific applications and interpretations. These prohibitions stem from Qur'anic verses and prophetic traditions, forming the universal boundaries of Islamic marriage law.

The schools agree that combining sisters in marriage is simultaneously forbidden, and that certain relationships become prohibited merely through contract conclusion (even without consummation), such as a father's wife becoming forbidden to the son immediately upon marriage.

### Guardian Authority and Competence
The concept of wilayah (guardianship) in marriage reveals significant theoretical and practical differences:

- **Hanafi School**: Allows adult women to marry independently without guardian approval
- **Shafi'i, Maliki, Hanbali Schools**: Require guardian involvement for virgin women
- **Ja'fari School**: Emphasizes the bride's consent above all, with guardian playing advisory role

> "Wilayah in marriage implies the legal authority granted to a competent guardian to be exercised over one under a legal disability for his or her advantage."
> _Original: "Wilayah in marriage implies the legal authority granted to a competent guardian to be exercised over one under a legal disability for his or her advantage."_
**Quick Take**: Guardian authority reflects each school's approach to balancing family protection with individual autonomy.

### Dower (Mahr) Regulations and Financial Rights
The dower system demonstrates sophisticated financial planning within Islamic marriage, with all schools agreeing on no upper limit but differing on minimum requirements and calculation methods:

- **Al-Mahr al-Musamma**: Specified dower agreed by both parties
- **Al-Mahr al-Mithl**: Comparable dower based on female relatives' standards
- **Al-Mut'ah**: Compensation for divorce before consummation when no dower specified

> "Al-mahr al-musamma is the mahr agreed by the couple and specified by them in the contract. This mahr does not have any upper limit, by consensus of all the schools."
> _Original: "Al-mahr al-musamma is the mahr agreed by the couple and specified by them in the contract. This mahr does not have any upper limit, by consensus of all the schools."_

### Contemporary Issues: Artificial Insemination
The book addresses modern bioethical questions through Islamic legal methodology, concluding that artificial insemination is prohibited based on Qur'anic principles protecting reproductive organs and limiting sexual relations to marriage contexts.

> "And who guard their private parts. Save from their wives or those whom their right hands own, for then they surely are not blameworthy. But whoever seeks to go beyond that, those are the transgressors." (23:5-7)
> _Original: "وَالَّذِينَ هُمْ لِفُرُوجِهِمْ حَافِظُونَ إِلَّا عَلَىٰ أَزْوَاجِهِمْ أَوْ مَا مَلَكَتْ أَيْمَانُهُمْ فَإِنَّهُمْ غَيْرَ مَلُومِينَ فَمَنِ ابْتَغَىٰ وَرَاءَ ذَٰلِكَ فَأُولَٰئِكَ هُمُ الْعَادُونَ"_
**Quick Take**: Contemporary issues are addressed through traditional legal methodology, demonstrating the system's adaptability.

## Key Takeaways
- **Contractual Foundation**: All schools require formal marriage contracts with specific recitations, but differ on acceptable wording and procedural requirements
- **Witness Diversity**: Witness requirements range from obligatory (Shafi'i, Hanafi, Hanbali) to recommended (Ja'fari) to consummation-focused (Maliki)

- **Contemporary Application**: Traditional legal principles can address modern bioethical questions through established methodology

## Questions to Consider
- How do the different witness requirements reflect each school's approach to legal proof and social validation?
- In what ways do the varying guardian authority models reveal different assumptions about family structure and individual autonomy?
- How might the flexibility in contract wording (Hanafi) versus strictness (Ja'fari) affect modern marriage practices?
- What role should financial considerations like dower play in contemporary marriage contracts?
- How can traditional Islamic legal methodology effectively address emerging bioethical challenges?
