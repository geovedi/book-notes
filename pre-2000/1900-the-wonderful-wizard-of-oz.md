## Core Insights

### The Journey to Self-Discovery
Dorothy's adventures in Oz teach her and her companions that the qualities they seek from the Wizard—brains, heart, courage, and a way home—are already within them. The Scarecrow demonstrates intelligence throughout their journey, the Tin Woodman shows deep compassion despite believing he lacks a heart, and the Lion acts bravely when it matters most, proving courage comes from action, not absence of fear.

> "True courage is in facing danger when you are afraid, and that kind of courage you have in plenty."

**Quick Take**: We often possess the qualities we think we're missing—they just need to be recognized and tested through experience.

### The Power of Home and Belonging
Despite the wonders and adventures in Oz, Dorothy's consistent goal is to return home to Kansas. The story celebrates the value of home while showing that appreciation for home comes through experiencing the wider world. Her famous realization—"There's no place like home"—resonates because it's earned through genuine adventure and hardship.

> "No matter how dreary and gray our homes are, we people of flesh and blood would rather live there than in any other country, be it ever so beautiful."

**Quick Take**: Home provides stability and meaning, especially when we've experienced the world beyond it.

### Friendship as Transformational Power
Each character gains something essential through their companionship. The Scarecrow, Tin Woodman, and Lion support Dorothy while discovering their own strengths. Their collective journey shows how friendship helps us overcome limitations and face challenges we couldn't tackle alone.

> "We are travelers, like yourself, and we are going to the Emerald City to see the Great Oz."

**Quick Take**: True friendship doesn't just provide company—it reveals our best selves through mutual support and shared purpose.
