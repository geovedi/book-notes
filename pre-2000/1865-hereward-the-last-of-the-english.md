## Fast-Track Story Guide

### The Hero's Origins
Hereward begins as a young Saxon nobleman outlawed from his homeland for his rebellious nature. He travels across Europe, gaining fame as a warrior in Ireland, Cornwall, and Flanders, where he earns the nickname "the Wake" for his vigilance and fighting prowess. These early adventures establish his character as a bold, resourceful, and passionate defender of his honor and people.

### The Norman Conquest
When William of Normandy conquers England at Hastings in 1066, Hereward is initially abroad. The novel portrays the devastating impact of the Norman conquest on the Saxon people, particularly the men of the Danelagh (Eastern England), who refuse to submit to Norman rule. Kingsley vividly depicts the brutal suppression of English resistance and the suffering of the conquered population.

### Return to England
Hereward returns to find his homeland transformed and his family displaced. He discovers that Norman soldiers have occupied his ancestral home at Bourne and that his mother has been driven out. This personal injustice fuels his determination to lead the resistance against the invaders.

### Leader of the Resistance
Hereward becomes the focal point of English resistance, gathering a diverse coalition of Saxon warriors, Danish allies, and disaffected nobles. He establishes his base in the treacherous fens of Eastern England, using the difficult terrain to his advantage against Norman forces. The novel portrays several brilliant military campaigns and guerrilla tactics that make Hereward a legendary figure among his people.

### The Siege of Ely
One of the novel's climactic sections revolves around the defense of Ely, an island stronghold in the fens. Hereward and his followers hold out against Norman forces for months, employing clever tactics and the natural defenses of the marshland. However, the resistance is ultimately betrayed from within, leading to the fall of the last major English stronghold.

### Personal Tragedy and Final Years
The novel explores Hereward's personal life, including his relationships with two very different women: Torfrida, his wise and devoted first wife, and Alftruda, a beautiful but treacherous Norman noblewoman who becomes his second wife. His personal tragedies mirror the broader tragedy of English defeat. The ending suggests that while Hereward may have been killed, his spirit of freedom lives on in the English people.

### Legacy
Kingsley concludes by suggesting that Hereward's spirit of resistance and love of freedom became part of the English national character, influencing later legends of outlaws like Robin Hood and contributing to England's eventual development of democratic institutions.
