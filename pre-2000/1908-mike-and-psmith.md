### The Absurdity of Authority
Wodehouse gently satirizes school authority figures through characters like Mr. Downing, whose dog becomes the center of a mysterious painting incident.

**Quick Take**: Authority figures, despite their apparent power, are often as fallible as anyone else, and their decisions deserve to be questioned respectfully.
