# The Engineers and the Price System
**Authors**: Thorstein Veblen | **Year**: 1921

## Summary
Thorstein Veblen's groundbreaking critique examines the fundamental conflict between industrial efficiency and business profit under the price system. Written in 1921, the book exposes how business management systematically sabotages production capacity to maintain profitable prices, creating artificial scarcity despite technological advances that could eliminate want. Veblen argues that engineers and technical experts, not business owners or financiers, should control industrial production to serve actual human needs rather than generate profits for absentee owners.

The book is particularly relevant for economists, business leaders, engineers, and policymakers interested in understanding how profit motives systematically undermine technological progress and social welfare. Readers will gain insights into the structural inefficiencies of capitalist production and the potential for a more rational, needs-based industrial organization.

## Core Insights

### The Nature of Industrial Sabotage
Veblen defines "sabotage" not as violent destruction but as the systematic withdrawal of efficiency that business managers routinely practice to maintain profitable prices. In the price system, production is deliberately kept below capacity to create artificial scarcity, because allowing full productivity would drive prices down and eliminate profits. This "conscientious withdrawal of efficiency" includes limiting output, reducing work hours, maintaining excess capacity, and other practices that would be considered wasteful from a purely technical standpoint.

> "The mechanical industry of the new order is inordinately productive. So the rate and volume of output have to be regulated with a view to what the traffic will bear — that is to say, what will yield the largest net return in terms of price to the business men who manage the country's industrial system."

**Quick Take**: Business efficiency means production inefficiency from society's perspective.

### Absentee Ownership as the Root Problem
Veblen identifies absentee ownership—where owners don't participate in the actual productive use of their property—as the fundamental cause of industrial dysfunction. This includes corporate shareholders, investors, and financial interests who profit from ownership while having no connection to production. Absentee owners prioritize financial returns over material output, forcing managers to sabotage production to maintain dividend payments and stock values.

> "By absentee ownership, as the term applies in this connection, is here to be understood the ownership of an industrially useful article by any person or persons who are not habitually employed in the industrial use of it."

**Quick Take**: When owners don't work with their property, they profit by preventing it from working fully.

### The Engineer's Dilemma
Engineers and technical experts understand how to maximize production efficiency, but they're subordinate to business managers who prioritize profit over productivity. Technologists can design systems that produce abundance, but business management deliberately implements these systems at reduced capacity. This creates a fundamental conflict: engineers are trained to maximize output while being forced to minimize it to maintain prices.

> "The experts in the case will, it is believed, be greatly helped out by detailed information on such existing organizations as, e.g., the distributing system of the Chicago Packers, the chain stores, and the mail-order houses."

**Quick Take**: The people who know how to produce abundance are forced to manage scarcity.

### The Evolution from Competition to Monopoly
Veblen traces how industrial capitalism evolved from competitive production to organized restriction. Early entrepreneurs combined technical and business skills, but as industries grew larger, financial control separated from technical management. This led to corporation finance and investment banking replacing competitive markets with coordinated restriction of output to maximize financial returns.

> "The corporation financier of popular tradition is taking on the character of a chief of bureau. The changes which have brought the corporation financier to this somewhat inglorious position of a routine administrator set in along with the early growth of corporation finance, somewhere around the middle of the nineteenth century."

**Quick Take**: Free competition naturally evolves into organized monopoly as industries mature.

### The Potential for a Soviet-style System
Veblen provocatively suggests that Soviet Russia might pioneer a new industrial system based on production for use rather than profit. While critical of Bolshevik methods, he recognizes that their elimination of absentee ownership could allow engineers to run industry at full capacity for social benefit rather than financial gain. This represents the only real alternative to price system sabotage.

> "It should be added that even in the unexpected event that the contemplated, overturn should, in the beginning, meet with armed opposition from the partisans of the old order, it will still be true that the duties of the incoming directorate will be of a technological character, in the main."

**Quick Take**: Only by eliminating absentee ownership can industry serve human needs instead of financial interests.

## Best Quotes

- "In any community that is organized on the price system, with investment and business enterprise, habitual unemployment of the available industrial plant and workmen, in whole or in part, appears to be the indispensable condition without which tolerable conditions of life cannot be maintained."

- "The business community has hopes of tiding things over by this means, but it is still a point in doubt whether the present unexampled large use of sabotage in the businesslike management of the staple industries will now suffice to bring the business community through this grave crisis without a disastrous shrinkage of its capitalization."

- "Price is of the essence of the case, whereas livelihood is not."

- "All this sabotage, as the term is now used, describes a certain system of industrial strategy or management, whether it is employed by one or another. What it describes is a resort to peaceable or surreptitious restriction, delay, withdrawal, or obstruction."

- "The requirements of profitable business will not tolerate it. So the rate and volume of output must be adjusted to the needs of the market, not to the working capacity of the available resources, equipment and man power, nor to the community's need of consumable goods."

## Action Items

- **Recognize Systemic Sabotage**: Identify how business practices in your industry deliberately limit efficiency to maintain prices rather than serve needs
- **Question "Natural" Scarcity**: Ask whether shortages result from actual physical limits or artificial business restrictions
- **Evaluate Absentee Ownership**: Consider how separation of ownership from use affects productivity in your field
- **Support Technical Expertise**: Advocate for placing engineers and technical experts in decision-making roles over business managers
- **Think Beyond Price Systems**: Consider alternative methods of organizing production based on use-value rather than exchange-value

## Questions to Consider

1. How does today's "gig economy" and platform capitalism represent a new form of absentee ownership?
2. If engineers controlled industry, would they be immune to the temptations of power and financial gain?
3. How has digital technology affected the balance between productive capacity and price maintenance?
4. What role does consumer behavior play in supporting the system of artificial scarcity?
5. Can democratic institutions effectively oversee a transition to production for use rather than profit?

## Conclusion

Veblen's analysis remains remarkably relevant a century later, exposing fundamental contradictions that still plague contemporary capitalism. The systematic sabotage of productivity to maintain financial returns explains persistent inequalities, environmental waste, and the gap between technological possibility and lived reality.

While Veblen's proposed solution—technocratic control of industry—has proven problematic in practice, his diagnosis of the disease remains incisive: absentee ownership systematically perverts the purpose of industrial technology from meeting human needs to generating financial returns for non-productive owners.

This book deserves reading not for its solutions but for its penetrating analysis of why our incredibly productive technological systems consistently fail to deliver abundance to those who need it most. In an era of artificial intelligence, automation, and supply chain crises, Veblen's insights about the conflict between technological capability and business imperatives have never been more relevant.

The book's enduring value lies in its ability to help readers see through the ideological veil of "efficient markets" to recognize the systematic inefficiency that business profit demands from our technological systems.
