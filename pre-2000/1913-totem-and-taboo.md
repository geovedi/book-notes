# Totem and Taboo: Some Points of Agreement Between the Mental Lives of Savages and Neurotics

**Authors**: Sigmund Freud | **Year**: 1913
**Category**: Psychology & Mental Health

## Summary

Freud's groundbreaking work explores the psychological parallels between primitive societies and modern neurotic individuals, arguing that the totemic rituals and taboos of ancient cultures represent the externalized expression of unconscious conflicts that still dominate the human psyche today. Through his psychoanalytic lens, Freud reveals how the Oedipus complex—the central conflict between desire for the mother and rivalry with the father—forms the foundation of religion, morality, society, and art itself.

The book is essential reading for anyone seeking to understand the hidden psychological forces that shape human culture, the origins of our moral instincts, and why certain universal patterns of behavior persist across all societies despite their surface differences. Readers will gain profound insights into how our unconscious continues to influence our actions through inherited psychological patterns that originated in humanity's earliest social structures.

## Core Insights

### 1. The Oedipus Complex as Cultural Foundation

Freud argues that the infamous Greek tragedy of Oedipus—who unknowingly kills his father and marries his mother—represents not just an individual psychological pattern but the foundational myth of all human civilization. He proposes that ancient societies were organized around primal hordes dominated by a powerful father who controlled access to women. The sons, driven by resentment and sexual jealousy, eventually united to kill and devour their father. This primal crime created such intense guilt that it spawned the first moral laws, religious prohibitions, and social structures. Every major civilization, according to Freud, carries the psychological imprint of this original sin, with our modern moral codes representing institutionalized forms of the guilt and remorse felt by these primal patricides.

> "In the beginning was the Deed" – Freud's modification of Goethe, emphasizing how a real act of primal violence shaped human civilization rather than abstract principles.

**Quick Take**: Our deepest moral prohibitions aren't rational choices but inherited guilt from ancestral crimes we unconsciously reenact throughout history.

### 2. Totemism: The Original Religion

Totemism—the practice where tribes identify with specific animals or natural objects—represents humanity's first religious system, according to Freud. The totem animal serves as a substitute father figure: it's both revered (as a protective ancestor) and feared (as a source of danger), reflecting the ambivalent feelings sons have toward their fathers. During totemic ceremonies, tribe members would ritually kill and eat the totem animal, reenacting the primal murder of the father while simultaneously establishing bonds of community through shared guilt. This ceremony, Freud argues, is the direct ancestor of modern religious rituals, including the Christian communion, where believers consume the body and blood of a sacrificed deity who redeems humanity from sin.

> "The Christian communion has absorbed within itself a sacrament which is doubtless far older than Christianity."

**Quick Take**: Modern religious rituals echo ancient totemic ceremonies, allowing us to symbolically reenact—and thereby manage—our most primal psychological conflicts.

### 3. Taboo: The Birth of Conscience

Freud reveals that taboo systems represent humanity's first moral law—essentially the earliest form of conscience. Taboos function as externalized prohibitions against our most dangerous unconscious impulses, particularly incest and aggression toward authority figures. What makes taboos fascinating is their dual nature: they're simultaneously sacred (untouchable, divine) and unclean (dangerous, forbidden). This ambivalence perfectly mirrors the mixed feelings children have toward parental authority—simultaneous love, fear, resentment, and respect. When someone violates a taboo, they don't just risk external punishment; they experience overwhelming guilt and anxiety, suggesting that taboos tap into deeply ingrained psychological patterns rather than merely social conventions.

> "Taboo conscience is probably the oldest form in which we meet the phenomenon of conscience."

**Quick Take**: Our modern conscience evolved from primitive taboo systems that externalized our internal conflicts between forbidden desires and social obligations.

### 4. Animism and Magical Thinking

Freud explains that primitive animism—the belief that natural objects contain spirits and that thoughts can directly influence reality—represents an early stage of human psychology that persists in modern neurotics. He calls this "the omnipotence of thought," where mental processes are given the same weight as physical actions. This magical thinking operates through two principles: imitation (that like produces like) and contagion (that things once in contact continue to influence each other). Modern obsessive-compulsive individuals, Freud notes, often suffer from exactly the same patterns—believing their thoughts can cause real harm and performing ritualistic behaviors to prevent imagined disasters. The difference is that primitives externalized these conflicts in social rituals, while neurotics internalize them in private symptoms.

> "Mistaking an ideal connection for a real one" – E.B. Tylor's definition of magic that Freud adopts to explain magical thinking.

**Quick Take**: Both primitive rituals and modern neurosis share the same fundamental error: treating thoughts as if they have the same power as physical actions.

### 5. Psychological Inheritance Across Generations

Perhaps Freud's most controversial but insightful claim is that psychological patterns can be transmitted across generations even when the original events are forgotten. He argues that the guilt and trauma from the primal patricide became embedded in humanity's collective unconscious, with each new generation inheriting these psychological conflicts despite having no direct memory of the original events. This explains why certain themes appear universally across cultures and why the Oedipus complex continues to dominate modern psychological development. We don't inherit the memories themselves, but rather the psychological structures and conflicts that those memories created, much like we inherit languages without remembering their origins.

> "If psychic processes of one generation did not continue in the next, if each had to acquire its attitude towards life afresh, there would be no progress in this field and almost no development."

**Quick Take**: We inherit not just biological traits from our ancestors but also psychological patterns and conflicts that shape our unconscious behavior.

## Best Quotes

- "The beginnings of religion, ethics, society, and art meet in the Oedipus complex. This is in entire accord with the findings of psychoanalysis, namely, that the nucleus of all neuroses as far as our present knowledge of them goes is the Oedipus complex."

- "Taboo conscience is probably the oldest form in which we meet the phenomenon of conscience."

- "In the beginning was the Deed." (Freud's modification of Goethe)

- "The Christian communion has absorbed within itself a sacrament which is doubtless far older than Christianity."

- "The word taboo has had a different fate; with the diminished importance of the ambivalence which it connotes it has itself disappeared, or rather, the words analogous to it have vanished from the vocabulary."

- "If psychic processes of one generation did not continue in the next, if each had to acquire its attitude towards life afresh, there would be no progress in this field and almost no development."

- "The horror of incest among primitive races is therefore, as we see, a consistent and suitable protection against the temptation which is the most powerful of all those that arise from the ambivalent relationship."

- "Mistaking an ideal connection for a real one."

## Action Items

- **Examine your own taboos**: Notice which behaviors or thoughts feel both forbidden and fascinating to you—they may reveal your unconscious conflicts.

- **Study family dynamics**: Pay attention to how parent-child relationships reflect the Oedipus pattern of love, rivalry, and identification.

- **Question moral absolutes**: Consider whether your strongest moral convictions might be inherited psychological patterns rather than rational principles.

- **Observe ritualistic behavior**: Look for patterns in religious, social, or personal rituals that may serve to manage unconscious conflicts.

- **Reflect on inheritance**: Consider what psychological patterns you might have inherited from your family and cultural background.

## Questions to Consider

- How do modern religious rituals continue to serve the psychological function of managing guilt and anxiety about forbidden desires?

- In what ways does contemporary society still reflect the basic structure of the primal horde—powerful authorities, sexual restrictions, and guilt-based morality?

- How might recognizing the psychological origins of our moral systems change our approach to ethics and social organization?

- What role does the conflict between individual desire and social obligation play in your own life and decisions?

- How do modern forms of entertainment (movies, sports, video games) serve to help us work through the same primal conflicts that ancient myths and rituals addressed?

## Conclusion

**Is this worth your time?** Absolutely. Despite being over a century old, Freud's "Totem and Taboo" remains a revolutionary work that fundamentally changed how we understand the relationship between individual psychology and human culture. While some of his anthropological claims have been challenged, his core insight—that our most sophisticated social institutions and moral systems may be elaborate externalizations of basic psychological conflicts—continues to influence psychology, anthropology, sociology, and literary criticism.

**The biggest reason to read this book** is its profound explanation of why certain patterns of behavior and belief persist across all human societies despite their surface differences. Freud offers a unified theory of human psychology that connects individual neurosis, social organization, religious belief, and cultural development into a single, coherent narrative. Whether you accept all his conclusions or not, you'll never look at religious rituals, moral prohibitions, or family dynamics the same way again. This book provides the tools to understand the hidden psychological forces that shape not just our individual lives, but entire civilizations.
