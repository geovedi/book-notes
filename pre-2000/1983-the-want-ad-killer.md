# The Want-Ad Killer

## Summary
"The Want-Ad Killer" is a chilling true crime narrative that chronicles the predatory career of Harvey Louis Carignan, a serial killer who used classified newspaper advertisements to lure young women to their deaths. The book centers on the tragic case of Kathy Sue Miller, a 16-year-old Seattle girl who answered a seemingly innocent want ad for a gas station job in May 1973, never to return home.

This meticulously researched work exposes not only Carignan's brutal crimes spanning multiple states, but also the frustrating legal loopholes that allowed him to evade justice for years. Ann Rule, who would later become America's premier true crime writer, demonstrates her signature style of combining intimate victim portraits with detailed investigative procedures.

The book is essential reading for true crime enthusiasts, law enforcement professionals, and anyone interested in the complexities of criminal psychology and the challenges of the American justice system.

## Core Insights

### The Method of a Monster
Harvey Carignan's signature approach was diabolically simple: he placed legitimate-looking want ads for jobs that would appeal to young women needing money - gas station attendants, secretarial work, and other entry-level positions. When victims called or came for interviews, he'd pick them up in his car and drive them to isolated locations where he would assault and murder them. His methodical cleaning of crime scenes and strategic disposal of evidence made prosecution nearly impossible.

> "In all the annals of American crime, there have been few killers more terrifying in their abuse of women... and in their abuse of our legal system."

**Quick Take**: Classified ads, once a trusted community resource, became Carignan's hunting ground - a reminder that danger often hides behind mundane appearances.

### The System's Frustration
Detectives Billy Baughman and Duane Homan knew Carignan was responsible for Kathy Miller's disappearance within days, but couldn't arrest him due to constitutional protections. Without physical evidence or witnesses, they were forced to watch as Carignan continued his life, knowing exactly what he had done. This Catch-22 situation highlights how constitutional rights designed to protect the innocent can sometimes shield the guilty.

> "Under our present system, I'm afraid the victim doesn't have the constitutional rights that the suspect has."

**Quick Take**: The justice system's safeguards can become double-edged swords when criminals exploit them more skillfully than investigators can work around them.

### A Killer's Psychology
Carignan claimed that God commanded him to "mortify" and "kill" women who aroused him sexually - a perverse interpretation of biblical scripture that he used to justify his crimes. The book explores his traumatic childhood in reform schools, claims of sexual abuse by women, and the development of his warped worldview where violence against women became both compulsion and divine mission.

> "I would listen to God even if I hadn't read any of this."

**Quick Take**: Carignan's religious rationalizations show how ideology can be twisted to justify the most heinous acts.

### The Mother's Nightmare
Mary Miller's premonition of her daughter's death fifteen years before it happened serves as the book's haunting frame. Her desperate attempts to save Kathy, from warning about want ads to calling the police before Kathy even went missing, create a portrait of maternal intuition that proves tragically accurate.

> "I dreamed that I had a daughter with long dark hair. She was fourteen years old in my dream, and someone had hurt her. There was blood all over her face."

**Quick Take**: Sometimes our deepest fears are not paranoia, but perception of dangers we can't yet see clearly.

### The Break That Finally Came
Carignan's eventual capture came not through the Miller case, but through the survival of another victim, Gwen Burton, who fought back and lived to testify. Her courage in facing her attacker in court provided the crucial testimony that finally ended Carignan's reign of terror, showing how victim resilience can overcome even the most cunning predators.

**Quick Take**: Survivor testimony remains one of law enforcement's most powerful tools against serial offenders who otherwise leave no physical evidence.

## Best Quotes
- "Kathy Sue Miller was a 16-year-old innocent when she answered the inviting job ad. When the police found her, even they were shocked by her murderer's depravity."
- "What made the crime even more maddening for Seattle police detectives Billy Baughman and Duane Homan was that they knew who the killer was, yet could not arrest him."
- "He had grown tall through all those years at Mandan, fattened on the high-carbohydrate diet dear to dietitians who must feed large groups of people."
- "The whole left side of her head was crushed."
- "I'd have to steel myself to talk, and when I would talk—especially in anger, which was often—I'd be vituperative and mean."

## Key Takeaways
- **Trust your instincts**: Mary Miller's intuition about the want ad proved correct - if something feels wrong, it probably is
- **Stranger danger extends to "professional" contexts**: Job interviews, especially for young people, should happen in public, professional settings
- **The justice system has limitations**: Sometimes knowing who committed a crime isn't enough to secure prosecution
- **Documentation matters**: Kathy's dental records and careful police work eventually helped identify her remains
- **Survivor testimony is crucial**: Gwen Burton's willingness to testify against her attacker was instrumental in securing justice

## Questions to Consider
- How might Carignan's crimes have been prevented with modern background checks and verification systems?
- Should the constitutional rights of suspects be balanced differently when known predators are involved?
- What role does childhood trauma and institutionalization play in creating violent offenders?
- How has the internet changed the landscape of predatory behavior compared to newspaper want ads?
- What more could be done to support victims' families during lengthy investigations?

## Conclusion
"The Want-Ad Killer" is a masterclass in true crime storytelling that reads like a novel but delivers the chilling impact of real events. While the pacing sometimes suffers from Rule's meticulous attention to detail, the book's power lies in its unflinching look at both human evil and human resilience.

This is essential reading not just for true crime fans, but for anyone who wants to understand how predators operate and how our justice system struggles to contain them. The story of Kathy Miller and the other victims serves as a timeless warning about the dangers that can hide behind everyday situations - and a testament to the persistence of investigators who refuse to let cases go cold.

The book's greatest strength is Rule's ability to humanize the victims while never sensationalizing their deaths, creating a work that honors their memory while delivering a compelling narrative of crime and punishment.
