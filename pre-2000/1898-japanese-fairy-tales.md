## Core Tales

### The Boy Who Drew Cats
A young, frail boy with an extraordinary talent for drawing cats is sent away from temple training for refusing to stop his artistic obsession. His wise teacher warns him: "Avoid large places at night—keep to small!" This advice saves his life when his drawings miraculously come to life to defeat a monstrous goblin-rat in a haunted temple.

> "He had what is called 'the genius of an artist,' and just for that reason he was not quite fit to be an acolyte."

**Quick Take**: Your unique talents, even when others don't understand them, may become your greatest strength in unexpected ways.

### Chin Chin Kobakama
A lazy noblewoman learns that tiny, inch-high warriors called Chin Chin Kobakama will torment anyone who disrespects the sacred cleanliness of Japanese home floors. These supernatural spirits emerge from the tatami mats at midnight to discipline those who are careless with their living spaces.

> "We are the Chin-chin Kobakama; the hour is late; sleep, honorable noble darling!"

> "He had drunk himself far back beyond the time of youth into the period of speechless infancy."

**Quick Take**: True wisdom comes not from reversing age, but from accepting life's natural progression with grace.
