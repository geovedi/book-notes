# Falkner, A Novel
**Authors**: Mary Wollstonecraft Shelley | **Year**: 1837
**Category**: Fiction & Literature

## Summary
Set in the early 19th century, "Falkner" tells the story of Elizabeth Raby, a young orphan who loses both her parents in rapid succession. After her father Edwin dies of consumption, her mother follows him just months later, leaving six-year-old Elizabeth completely alone in the coastal village of Treby, Cornwall. The child is taken in reluctantly by Mrs. Baker, the landlady of the lodging house where the Rabys had been staying, but faces neglect and poverty.

The novel transforms when John Falkner, a former captain in the East India Company's cavalry, arrives in Treby carrying a heavy burden of guilt. He was indirectly responsible for the death of Alithea, Elizabeth's mother's closest friend and confidante, and is now haunted by remorse. After discovering Elizabeth visiting her parents' graves and contemplating suicide at that very spot, Falkner sees an opportunity for redemption. He adopts Elizabeth and begins an extensive journey across Europe, attempting to find peace through caring for the child while evading the consequences of his past actions.

This gothic romance explores themes of guilt, redemption, found family, and the possibility of atonement through love and devotion to the innocent. It's particularly compelling for readers interested in Mary Shelley's work beyond "Frankenstein," as it represents her maturation as a novelist dealing with complex psychological themes.

## Core Insights

### The Orphan's Journey
Elizabeth Raby's transformation from a neglected village orphan to a well-traveled, educated young woman forms the emotional core of the novel. When we first meet her, she's visiting her parents' graves daily, talking to them and maintaining an innocent belief that her mother's spirit watches over her. Her beauty and angelic disposition make her beloved by the villagers, but she's essentially alone in the world. Falkner's arrival changes everything, offering her protection, education, and the parental love she's lost. Their relationship develops naturally through shared hardships and tender moments during their extensive travels across Europe.

> "No one could have regarded her unmoved; her silver-toned laugh went to the heart; her alternately serious or gay looks, each emanating from the spirit of love."
**Quick Take**: The novel shows how love and stability can transform even the most damaged childhood, suggesting that found families can be just as powerful as biological ones.

### Falkner's Burden of Guilt
John Falkner is a complex character trapped between his violent passions and his desire for redemption. His guilt stems from his role in Alithea's death – Elizabeth's mother's best friend – whom he loved obsessively. This guilt drives him initially to suicide at Treby churchyard, where Elizabeth's innocent presence stops him. His decision to adopt and protect Elizabeth becomes his path to atonement, though he constantly fears his past crimes will catch up with him. The psychological depth of his remorse and his genuine transformation through caring for Elizabeth represents Shelley's sophisticated exploration of redemption.

> "He had desired a peaceful happiness--the happiness of love. His fond aspirations had been snakes to destroy others, and to sting his own soul to torture."
**Quick Take**: True redemption comes not from self-punishment but from selfless devotion to others, suggesting that even the most troubled souls can find peace through love.

### The Grand Tour as Escape and Education
Falkner's extensive travels across Europe – from Paris to Hamburg, Stockholm, St. Petersburg, Moscow, and beyond – serve dual purposes. For him, it's escape from potential prosecution and the painful memories of England. For Elizabeth, it becomes an extraordinary education that far exceeds what any English girl of her time would receive. The constant journey creates an unbreakable bond between them, as they face dangers, illnesses, and adventures together. This perpetual motion reflects Falkner's inability to settle anywhere peacefully while still being pursued by his past.

> "Paris, Hamburgh, Stockholm, St. Petersburgh, Moscow, Odessa, Constantinople, through Hungary to Vienna. How many thousand miles! miles--which while he traversed, he could possess his soul in freedom."
**Quick Take**: Sometimes the best education comes not from books but from lived experience and facing challenges alongside those who love us.
