**Illustrator**: Peter Madsen | **Publication**: Carlsen, 2016

## Summary
In the deepest parts of the ocean, where the water is as blue as the prettiest cornflower and as clear as crystal, lives a young mermaid princess who dreams of the human world. Unlike her five older sisters who are content with their underwater life, the youngest mermaid is fascinated by stories of ships, cities, and humans—who possess immortal souls, something mermaids can never obtain. On her fifteenth birthday, when she finally rises to the surface, she witnesses a ship's celebration and saves a handsome prince from drowning, falling deeply in love with him.

Desperate to join the human world and win the prince's love, the little mermaid makes a dangerous bargain with the sea witch: she trades her beautiful voice for human legs, though every step brings excruciating pain. Despite her suffering, she befriends the prince who treats her like a cherished child but cannot recognize her as his savior. When the prince becomes engaged to a princess from a neighboring kingdom—who he mistakenly believes saved him—the little mermaid faces an impossible choice: murder the prince to return to her mermaid life, or die and become sea foam at dawn.

This timeless fairy tale explores themes of sacrifice, unrequited love, and the pursuit of transcendence, ultimately delivering a message about finding purpose through selfless suffering rather than possession.

Perfect for readers who appreciate emotionally complex fairy tales that challenge the notion of "happily ever after" endings. Those who loved Andersen's original work will find new depth in this beautifully illustrated edition that preserves the story's bittersweet essence while making it accessible to modern readers.

## Core Insights

### The Pain of Transformation
The little mermaid's journey from sea to land represents the agonizing process of fundamental change. Every step on human legs feels like treading on sharp knives, yet she bears this willingly for love and the hope of gaining an immortal soul. This physical suffering mirrors the emotional pain of leaving behind everything familiar and confronting the harsh reality that transformation doesn't guarantee acceptance or love.

> "Pride must suffer pain," replied the old lady, when the little mermaid complained about the heavy pearls and adornments she had to wear for her first trip to the surface.

**Quick Take**: True transformation often requires enduring pain that others cannot see; the greatest changes demand the greatest sacrifices.

### Love Without Recognition
Perhaps the story's most poignant element is the mermaid's unreciprocated devotion. She saves the prince's life, abandons her family, trades her voice, and endures constant pain—all while he remains unaware of her true identity and loves her only as a child-like companion. His inability to recognize her as his savior becomes the tragic irony that drives the narrative toward its heartbreaking conclusion.

> "He says the maiden belongs to the holy temple, therefore she will never return to the world. They will not meet again. I am by his side, and see him every day. I will take care of him, and love him, and give up my life for his sake."

**Quick Take**: Love without recognition can be both noble and tragic—noble in its selflessness, tragic in its invisibility.

### The Nature of Immortality
Andersen explores different conceptions of immortality: humans possess eternal souls that continue after death, while mermaids become sea foam after their 300-year lifespan. The little mermaid's quest for a human soul represents a desire for meaning beyond temporal existence. In the end, she finds another path to eternity through becoming a daughter of the air, earning a soul through good deeds rather than romantic love.

> "Human beings, on the contrary, have a soul, which lives forever, lives after the body has turned to dust. It rises up through the clear, pure air beyond the glittering stars."

**Quick Take**: True immortality may come not from what we possess, but from what we give and how we transcend ourselves.

### Choice in the Face of Death
The story's climax presents a profound moral dilemma when the mermaid's sisters offer her a magical knife: kill the prince and return home as a mermaid, or let him live and face dissolution into sea foam. Her choice to spare him, even though it means her own destruction, represents the ultimate act of selfless love.

> "She bent down and kissed his fair brow, then looked at the sky on which the rosy dawn grew brighter and brighter; then she glanced at the sharp knife, and again fixed her eyes on the prince, who whispered the name of his bride in his dreams."

**Quick Take**: The truest test of character comes not in moments of triumph, but in how we choose when facing inevitable loss.

## Best Quotes

- "Far away, where the ocean is as blue as the prettiest cornflower, and as clear as crystal, it is very, very deep; deeper than the length of any rope: many church steeples, piled one upon another, would not reach from the seabed beneath to the surface above the water."

- "Nothing gave her so much pleasure as to hear about the world above the sea. She made her old grandmother tell her all she knew of the ships and of the towns, the people and the animals."

- "If human beings are not drowned, can they live forever? Do they never die as we do here in the sea?" asked the little mermaid mournfully; "I would give gladly all the hundreds of years that I have to live, to be a human being only for one day."

- "Every step she took was as the witch said it would be. She felt as if she were treading upon the points of needles or sharp knives; but she bore it willingly, and stepped as lightly by the prince's side as a bubble, so that he and all that saw her wondered at her graceful-swaying movements."

- "So for three hundred years we shall float like this," said the little mermaid, "till at last we come into the kingdom of heaven."

## Conclusion

"The Little Mermaid" transcends the typical fairy tale formula to offer profound insights into love, sacrifice, and the human condition. Unlike Disney's sanitized version, Andersen's original presents a darker, more complex narrative where love doesn't conquer all through romantic fulfillment, but through transcendent self-sacrifice. The story's power lies in its refusal to provide easy answers—instead, it asks readers to consider whether the pursuit of an unattainable ideal, even in failure, can still hold meaning and value.

This illustrated edition by Peter Madsen breathes new visual life into Andersen's masterpiece while preserving its emotional complexity. For readers seeking deeper understanding of love's painful realities and the possibility of finding redemption through suffering, "The Little Mermaid" offers a timeless meditation on what it means to be truly human, even for those who are not.

The biggest reason to read this version is to experience Andersen's original vision—a story that reminds us that sometimes the most profound love stories end not with "happily ever after," but with transformation through sacrifice, suggesting that our highest calling may be to become something greater than ourselves through the very suffering that threatens to destroy us.
