## Core Insights

### The Power of Documentation and Knowledge
The entire story is told through personal journals, letters, and professional records, highlighting how knowledge and careful documentation become weapons against evil.

**Quick Take**: Meticulous observation and knowledge-sharing create collective intelligence that can defeat seemingly invincible forces.

### The Nature of Good Versus Evil
Dracula represents ancient, predatory evil that threatens modern Victorian society. The protagonists embody different aspects of good: scientific rationality (Seward), romantic love (Arthur), spiritual knowledge (Van Helsing), and domestic virtue (Mina). Their victory depends on combining these strengths rather than relying on any single approach.

The Count brings Eastern European superstition and corruption into rational, civilized England, requiring the heroes to venture into his territory to ultimately defeat him.

While Victorian society often portrayed women as fragile, both Mina and Lucy demonstrate remarkable resilience. Lucy's transformation into a vampire and Mina's psychic connection to Dracula show women's vulnerability, but also their strength and crucial role in the supernatural conflict.
