# Psychiatric Slavery
**Original Title**: La Schiavitù Psichiatrica
**Author**: Thomas Stephen Szasz | **Year**: 1977
**Category**: Health & Medicine

## Summary
Thomas Szasz's "Psychiatric Slavery" is a powerful critique of coercive psychiatry that uses the landmark case of Kenneth Donaldson—a man institutionalized for 15 years against his will—to expose what Szasz calls the myth of mental illness and the systematic violation of individual rights in psychiatric institutions. Donaldson was confined in 1957 after complaining that people were trying to poison him, declared "paranoid schizophrenic," and held until 1971 despite never being proven dangerous. His subsequent lawsuit against his psychiatrists for failing to treat him created a legal paradox that Szasz dissects with precision: Donaldson's lawyers argued he had a constitutional "right to treatment" while Donaldson himself maintained he wasn't ill and didn't want treatment.

Szasz draws direct parallels between psychiatric institutionalization and historical chattel slavery, arguing both systems operate by defining certain classes of people as less than fully human and therefore justifiably deprived of liberty. He demonstrates how psychiatry functions as an instrument of social control, using medical language to disguise what is essentially political imprisonment. The book reveals how even well-intentioned civil liberties organizations ended up strengthening psychiatric coercion by demanding better "treatment" rather than challenging the fundamental right to institutionalize people against their will.

Readers interested in civil liberties, medical ethics, and the power of institutions to control individual lives will find this book eye-opening. It delivers a devastating critique of how professional authority can override personal freedom, showing how the "right to treatment" became justification for expanding rather than limiting psychiatric coercion.

## Core Insights

### The Myth of Mental Illness as Justification for Coercion
Szasz argues that "mental illness" is not a medical condition but a metaphor for behavioral problems that society finds disturbing. Unlike physical diseases, mental illnesses have no identifiable biological markers and are diagnosed through subjective judgments about behavior and beliefs. By calling these problems "illnesses," psychiatry creates a justification for intervening in people's lives against their will—something that would be unacceptable if framed as political or social control.

> "I maintain that all the numerous principles that currently underpin institutional psychiatry are based on little more than a pile of openly declared lies—such as calling the buildings where innocent people are locked up 'hospitals.'"
> _Original: "Alla base di innumerevoli principi psichiatrici attuali, non c'è che un mucchio di bugie apertamente dichiarate — come quella di chiamare ospedali gli edifici in cui viene rinchiusa della gente innocente."_

**Quick Take**: The medical language of psychiatry disguises what is fundamentally a system of social control, allowing society to imprison people for thoughts and behaviors rather than actual crimes.

### The Donaldson Case: A Tragic Comedy of Errors
Kenneth Donaldson's case reveals the absurd logic of psychiatric institutionalization. A 48-year-old man living with his parents, Donaldson was committed after claiming someone was poisoning his food—paranoid thoughts that certainly warranted concern but not necessarily imprisonment. Despite having no history of violence, he was declared "paranoid schizophrenic" and confined for nearly 15 years. Ironically, Donaldson was a Christian Scientist who refused medical treatment on religious grounds, yet his lawyers later sued psychiatrists for failing to treat him, creating the contradictory position of demanding treatment for someone who didn't want it and didn't believe he needed it.

> "Donaldson was freed not because he had suddenly become sane, nor because he had suddenly become non-dangerous, but because the psychiatric authorities responsible judged it too risky to subject Donaldson's prolonged confinement to judicial scrutiny in these new circumstances."
> _Original: "È ovvio che Donaldson fu liberato non perché era improvvisamente rinsavito, e neppure perché era improvvisamente diventato non-pericoloso, ma perché le autorità psichiatriche responsabili giudicarono troppo rischioso sottoporre, in queste nuove circostanze, la legittimità della prolungata reclusione di Donaldson al giudizio di una Corte."_

**Quick Take**: The system trapped both patient and psychiatrists in a mutually destructive relationship where neither could escape without admitting fundamental errors about psychiatric confinement.

### The "Right to Treatment" as Expanded State Power
The legal strategy of demanding a "right to treatment" for involuntarily committed patients ultimately strengthened psychiatric coercion rather than limiting it. By accepting the premise that these people were ill and needed treatment, civil liberties advocates implicitly validated the entire system of psychiatric confinement. Szasz shows how this approach paradoxically gave psychiatrists even more power to force treatment on unwilling patients, since failure to provide adequate "treatment" could now result in lawsuits.

> "The so-called right to treatment is, in reality, a right to treat. Usually, mentally ill people who are hospitalized against their will do not want the treatments they receive from institutional psychiatrists. If they wanted them, there would be no need to lock them up and force them, legally and physically, to submit to the interventions that psychiatrists call cures, and that patients, instead, consider torture."
> _Original: "Non è un diritto alla cura, ma un diritto a curare. Di solito, i malati mentali ricoverati senza il loro consenso non vogliono le cure che ricevono dagli psichiatri istituzionali. Se le volessero, non ci sarebbe bisogno di rinchiuderli e costringerli, legalmente e fisicamente, a sottomettersi agli interventi che gli psichiatri chiamano cure, e che i pazienti, invece, considerano torture."_

**Quick Take**: Well-intentioned efforts to improve conditions for psychiatric patients ended up expanding the very system that imprisoned them, turning treatment into a tool of coercion rather than liberation.

### Psychiatry and Slavery: The Logic of Dehumanization
Szasz draws a compelling parallel between chattel slavery and psychiatric institutionalization, showing how both systems operate by first defining certain groups as less than fully human. Just as slaveholders argued that Black people needed white masters to care for them, psychiatrists argue that "mental patients" need medical experts to manage their lives. In both cases, the language of benevolence and protection disguises what is fundamentally about control and subjugation.

> "In the unhappy marriage between psychiatrist and mental patient, of which the public is inevitably a witness, each party has its legitimate complaints. The psychiatrists blame the patients, the patients blame the psychiatrists, and the public—composed partly of psychiatrists and patients and partly of people whose behavior is not much better—are happy to free themselves from the annoyance caused by the inconvenient complaints of the two litigants in the simplest and cheapest way possible (which means, usually, maintaining the status quo)."
> _Original: "Nel disgraziato matrimonio tra psichiatra e malato, di cui il pubblico è inevitabilmente testimone, ciascuna delle due parti ha le sue giuste lagnanze da fare. Gli psichiatri se la prendono con i malati, i malati con gli psichiatri, e il pubblico — composto in parte da psichiatri e da malati e in parte da persone il cui comportamento non è molto migliore — è felice di liberarsi dei fastidio provocato dalle importune lamentele dei due litiganti nel modo più semplice e più a buon mercato possibile (il che signifia, di solito, mantenere lo status quo)."_

**Quick Take**: Both systems depend on convincing society that some people are incapable of managing their own lives and therefore justifiably placed under the control of others.

### The Therapeutic State: Medicine as Social Control
Szasz introduces the concept of the "therapeutic state"—a society that uses medical language to justify controlling people's behavior. He argues that when states claim the power to define what constitutes "illness" and "treatment," they acquire unlimited authority to intervene in citizens' lives. The psychiatric establishment, in collaboration with government, creates a system where any deviation from social norms can be medicalized and treated, effectively eliminating the distinction between medical care and social control.

> "When the State is an accomplice in the mystification operated by psychiatry—when it itself intervenes as an agent or representative of force and deception—it cannot simultaneously constitute a safeguard against its own action."
> _Original: "Evidentemente, dove lo Stato è complice della mistificazione operata dalla psichiatria — dove esso stesso interviene come agente o rappresentante della forza e dell'inganno — non può contemporaneamente costituire una salvaguardia contro il suo stesso agire."_

**Quick Take**: The fusion of medical authority and state power creates a system where personal freedom is secondary to professional expertise and social order.

## Best Quotes

- "The only honest approach is to leave people alone. Offer them help while refraining from coercive interventions."
  _Original: "Sì. Lasciare in pace la gente. Offrire loro aiuto astenendosi da interventi coercitivi."_

- "The true task of civil rights defenders dealing with coercive psychiatry is not how to reduce its abuses, but how to dismantle its professional arrogance and its political support."
  _Original: "In breve, per noi si tratta di abolire la schiavitù, non di rendere più accoglienti i luoghi di reclusione."_

- "Institutions whose task is to help people in need, regardless of circumstances, are organizations like the Red Cross, the Salvation Army, rescue missions, and other charitable associations. The danger lies in the fact that it is often difficult for a group—especially if it is a prestigious group with a large public apparatus—to seek to improve situation X without at the same time authenticating and reinforcing the moral and intellectual base that authorizes its existence."
  _Original: "Le istituzioni il cui compito è di offrire aiuto alle persone bisognose, indipendentemente dalle circostanze, sono organizzazioni come la croce rossa, l'esercito della salvezza, le missioni di salvataggio, e altre associazioni di carità. Il pericolo è nascosto nel fatto che molte volte è difficile che un gruppo — soprattutto se è un gruppo di prestigio dotato di un grande apparato pubblico — cerchi di migliorare la situazione X senza autenticare e rinforzare nel contempo la base morale e intellettuale che ne autorizza l'esistenza."_

- "A person who declares they are well and therefore refuses any kind of medical care is certainly not treated with respect when psychiatrists act as if they are mentally ill and lawyers as if they have the right to be cured."
  _Original: "Una persona che dichiara di star bene, e di conseguenza rifiuta qualsiasi tipo di cura medica, non è certo trattata con rispetto se gli psichiatri agiscono come se fosse malata di mente e gli avvocati come se avesse il diritto di essere curata."_

- "No oppressive institution survives once it has been correctly defined—or rather, no oppressive institution can be correctly defined until it has been defeated."
  _Original: "Non c'è esempio migliore per illustrare il punto di vista che nessuna istituzione oppressiva sopravvive una volta che viene correttamente definita, o meglio, che nessuna istituzione oppressiva può essere correttamente definita finché non è stata sconfitta."_

## Questions to Consider

1. If "mental illness" has no biological markers, on what basis can we justify depriving people of liberty for having these conditions?
2. Why do we accept psychiatric confinement for people who haven't committed crimes, while demanding due process for other forms of imprisonment?
3. How does the language of medicine and treatment mask what is essentially social control and political imprisonment?
4. What would a society look like that genuinely respected individual autonomy while still providing help to those in distress?
5. If treatment is truly beneficial, why must it be imposed against people's will rather than offered as a choice?

## Conclusion
"Psychiatric Slavery" remains a powerful and controversial critique of coercive psychiatry decades after its publication. Szasz's argument that psychiatric institutionalization functions as a form of slavery disguised as medical treatment challenges readers to reconsider fundamental assumptions about mental illness, individual rights, and the role of medicine in social control. The book's greatest strength is its unflinching examination of how professional authority and state power combine to deprive people of liberty under the guise of helping them.

Whether you agree with Szasz's complete rejection of the concept of mental illness or not, the book raises crucial questions about individual autonomy, medical ethics, and the proper limits of state power over individual lives. It forces readers to confront uncomfortable truths about how society treats those deemed different or disturbing, and how easily concerns about "helping" can become justifications for control. For anyone interested in civil liberties, medical ethics, or the relationship between individual freedom and institutional authority, this book provides essential insights that remain relevant today.
