### The Magical Journey
The children "borrow" a pony and trap (which Robert names Rob-Roy) and travel through the English countryside toward the mountains. Their journey takes an unexpected turn when Rob-Roy leads them not to mountains but to a Devon village and their Great-Uncle Ambrose, a retired schoolmaster who secretly adores children.

**Quick Take**: Sometimes the right path isn't the one we planned.

### The Cursed Manor
The children discover their uncle lives near a mysterious Manor House where Lady Alicia Valerian lives in self-imposed exile, while her son Francis has been driven mad and lives as a hermit in a cave. They learn that a curse of ill will, enacted years ago by the villagers Emma and Tom, has plagued the family and caused the squire to lose his memory and disappear.

### The Power of Goodwill
With the help of Ezra, a wise local man who practices white magic, the children work to counteract the curse with their natural goodwill and kindness.
