## Summary
This groundbreaking anthropological study offers a comprehensive examination of Japanese sexual culture, practices, and beliefs in the early 20th century. Compiled through extensive folkloristic research by Friedrich S. Krauss and Japanese collaborator Tamio Satow, the work documents everything from religious rituals and superstitions to everyday sexual practices, terminology, and artistic expressions. The book serves as both a scholarly documentation and a preservation of cultural practices that were rapidly disappearing during Japan's modernization period.

This valuable resource provides unique insights into how sexuality was integrated into Japanese spiritual life, folk traditions, and social customs. Researchers, anthropologists, and anyone interested in Japanese cultural history will gain unprecedented access to authentic sources, including folk poems (senryū), temple records, and first-hand observations that would otherwise be lost to history.

## Core Insights

### Sacred Sexuality and Religious Practices

The work reveals how deeply sexuality was woven into Japan's religious and spiritual traditions. Phallic worship was common in Shintō shrines, with stone and wooden phalluses serving as votive offerings for fertility and protection. These sacred objects weren't merely symbolic but represented genuine beliefs about the life-giving power of sexual energy. Buddhist priests, despite their vows of celibacy, were often associated with homosexual practices (nanshoku), creating a complex dynamic between religious doctrine and human behavior.

> "The phallus was not merely a symbol but was regarded as the actual embodiment of the life-giving principle."
> _Original: "Der Phallus war nicht bloß ein Symbol, sondern galt als die eigentliche Verkörperung des lebensspendenden Prinzips."_

**Quick Take**: Japanese religious traditions integrated sexuality as a natural, sacred force rather than something to be suppressed or hidden.

### Homosexuality (Nanshoku) as Social Institution

Perhaps surprisingly, same-sex relationships between men (nanshoku) were widely accepted and institutionalized in Japanese society. The practice was particularly common in Buddhist monasteries, samurai culture, and theater circles. Unlike Western perspectives that treated homosexuality as deviant, Japanese culture viewed it as a natural variation of human sexuality, complete with its own terminology, social roles, and cultural expressions.

> "The anus is an artificial vulva for the Buddhist priest."
> _Original: "Der Anus ist eine künstliche Vulva für den buddhistischen Priester."_

**Quick Take**: Traditional Japanese society recognized multiple forms of sexual expression as legitimate within their social contexts.

### Erotic Arts and Literature (Makurae)

The book extensively documents Japan's rich tradition of erotic art and literature, known as "makurae" (pillow pictures) and "makurazōshi" (pillow books). These weren't merely pornography but sophisticated artistic expressions that combined visual beauty with literary merit. Created by established artists, these works followed strict conventions, typically appearing in series of twelve to represent the legendary emperor who married twelve women. The art was idealized rather than realistic, focusing on beauty and suggestion rather than graphic detail.

> "It lies in the nature of an ukiyo-e painter to direct his eyes to the vulva."
> _Original: "Es liegt in dem Wesen eines Ukiyo-eshi, seine Augen auf den Cunnus zu richten."_

**Quick Take**: Japanese erotic art was elevated to high culture, blending aesthetic beauty with sexual expression in ways that Western cultures rarely achieved.

### Folk Wisdom and Sexual Terminology

One of the most valuable aspects of this work is its preservation of Japanese sexual terminology and folk wisdom. The authors collected hundreds of terms, poems, and sayings that reveal how ordinary people thought about and discussed sexuality. The senryū (satirical poems) offer particularly candid insights into sexual attitudes, showing humor, frankness, and psychological sophistication that challenges modern assumptions about historical sexual repression.

> "Generally, a person's birthplace is a very hairy area."
> _Original: "Gewöhnlich ist die Geburtsstätte des Menschen eine sehr haarige Gegend."_

**Quick Take**: Japanese folk culture approached sexuality with remarkable openness, humor, and psychological insight.

### Sexual Aids and Practices

The work documents various sexual aids and practices employed by the Japanese, including artificial phalluses (harikata) and vulvas (azumagata), aphrodisiacs (hiyaku), and elaborate sexual positions (shijū-hatte). These weren't mere curiosities but reflected sophisticated understanding of human sexuality and pleasure. The detailed descriptions of 48 different sexual positions show a culture that valued sexual knowledge and technique as worthy of study and refinement.

**Quick Take**: Traditional Japanese sexual culture was remarkably sophisticated in its understanding of pleasure, technique, and sexual health.

## Conclusion

This remarkable work deserves attention from anyone interested in Japanese culture, sexual history, or anthropology. While some readers may find the explicit content challenging, the book's scholarly approach and cultural insights make it invaluable. The biggest reason to engage with this work is its preservation of cultural knowledge that might otherwise be lost forever.

The book's greatest strength lies in its authentic documentation of folk wisdom, terminology, and practices that reveal a sophisticated understanding of human sexuality. Rather than being merely titillating, the work demonstrates how traditional Japanese society integrated sexuality into a holistic cultural framework that recognized its spiritual, artistic, and social dimensions.

For modern readers, this work offers a powerful reminder that contemporary Western approaches to sexuality are not universal or inevitable. Japan's historical sexual culture provides alternative models for how societies can understand, express, and integrate sexuality into broader cultural and spiritual contexts. The work stands as both a valuable scholarly resource and a challenge to modern assumptions about the history of human sexuality.
