# The Story of Atlantis and the Lost Lemurian Continent
**Authors**: W. Scott-Elliot, A. P. Sinnett (Preface) | **Year**: 1896
**Category**: Fantasy & Science Fiction

## Summary
This comprehensive work details the complete history of Atlantis as revealed through esoteric clairvoyant investigation, tracing its rise and fall over millions of years. Drawing from "the memory of Nature"—an astral record that preserves all events with infallible accuracy—the book presents a radically different view of human prehistory than conventional archaeology accepts.

The narrative spans four distinct geological periods, showing Atlantis as a vast continent that once dominated the Atlantic Ocean, stretching from the Americas to Europe and Africa. The work describes seven distinct sub-races that developed on the mother continent, each with unique physical characteristics, political systems, and cultural achievements. It reveals the Atlanteans as a psychically-gifted civilization with advanced technology, including vril energy manipulation, sophisticated airships, and powerful explosives.

Anyone interested in alternative history, esoteric traditions, or the possibility of lost civilizations will find this work compelling. Readers seeking to understand humanity's hidden origins and the cyclical nature of civilizations will discover a worldview that challenges conventional academic paradigms while offering profound insights into human potential.

## Core Insights

### The Memory of Nature: Astral Records of History
The foundation of this work rests on the concept that Nature maintains an infallible, permanent record of all events accessible through astral clairvoyance. Unlike written records, which can be lost or altered, this "memory of Nature" preserves every moment with absolute accuracy across millions of years.

> "The memory of Nature is in reality a stupendous unity, just as in another way all mankind is found to constitute a spiritual unity if we ascend to a sufficiently elevated plane of Nature in search of the wonderful convergence where unity is reached without the loss of individuality."

This esoteric research method allows access to periods far beyond conventional historical records, making it possible to study the complete evolution of human consciousness and civilization across vast time spans that modern science considers prehistoric.

**Quick Take**: Human history extends back millions of years, and we have the potential to access complete records of our past through developing higher consciousness faculties.

### The Seven Atlantean Sub-Races
Atlantis wasn't populated by a single unified people but by seven distinct sub-races that emerged sequentially, each representing an evolutionary development in human consciousness:

1. **Rmoahal** - The earliest sub-race, giants standing 10-12 feet tall with mahogany-black skin, originating from what is now the Ashanti coast of Africa
2. **Tlavatli** - A powerful red-brown race of mountain-dwellers, physically strong but not as tall as the Rmoahals
3. **Toltec** - The most magnificent civilization, ruling the entire continent for thousands of years with great material power and spiritual wisdom
4. **First Turanian** - Eastern colonists who engaged in various social and political experiments
5. **Original Semite** - A turbulent, warlike race from the northern peninsulas (now Scotland and Ireland)
6. **Akkadian** - Great traders and seafarers who eventually conquered the Semites and established a wise dynasty
7. **Mongolian** - The only sub-race that developed entirely off the mother-continent, spreading across Asia

Each sub-race represented specific evolutionary lessons and contributed unique qualities to human development, from the Rmoahals' primitive beginning to the Toltecs' spiritually-advanced civilization.

**Quick Take**: Human diversity stems from ancient evolutionary pathways that developed specific qualities and consciousness levels over millions of years.

### Atlantean Technology: Vril Power and Advanced Sciences
The Atlantean civilization possessed technology far beyond our own, operating on principles of energy manipulation rather than mechanical force. Their most remarkable achievement was mastery of "vril"—a subtle energy that could be directed through consciousness for various purposes including healing, communication, and propulsion.

Their airships were "decked over" and propelled by vril energy, capable of high speeds without exposing passengers to the elements. They had developed sophisticated explosives that released poisonous gases rather than relying on impact, and their writing system involved metal sheets with porcelain-like surfaces that could be reproduced through chemical processes.

The Atlanteans also possessed extensive psychic abilities that were considered normal during their era. These included clairvoyance, telepathy, and the capacity to access the memory of Nature directly—abilities that have largely atrophied in modern humanity.

**Quick Take**: Ancient civilizations may have achieved technological sophistication through spiritual and energetic principles rather than purely mechanical ones.

### The Four Cataclysms and Geographic Transformation
Atlantis didn't sink in a single event but through a series of four major cataclysms spanning nearly a million years:

- **First Map Period** (1 million years ago): Atlantis at its greatest extent, a massive continent dominating the Atlantic
- **Second Map Period** (800,000 years ago): After the first great catastrophe, the continent broke into two islands: Ruta and Daitya
- **Third Map Period** (200,000 years ago): Further subsidence created smaller landmasses while showing relatively minor changes overall
- **Fourth Map Period** (75,000-9,564 BC): Only Poseidonis remained, a small island that finally sank completely in 9,564 BC

These gradual destructions mirror the cyclical nature of civilizations—rising, achieving greatness, then declining as spiritual wisdom gives way to materialism and corruption. The final destruction of Poseidonis marked the end of Atlantean dominance and the transition to our current Aryan civilization.

**Quick Take**: Civilizations rise and fall in cycles, with geological and spiritual forces working together to transform the Earth and human consciousness.

### The Divine Dynasty and Spiritual Governance
During the Toltec golden age, Atlantis was ruled by spiritually advanced beings—an actual "Divine Dynasty" of initiated Adepts who governed according to higher laws. These rulers maintained connection with the "Occult Hierarchy that governs the world," ensuring civilization developed in harmony with cosmic evolution.

The second Toltec emperor was an Adept who ruled wisely for thousands of years. His successors were all initiates to varying degrees, with power often passed from father to son. This government was described as "just and beneficent," fostering tremendous achievements in arts, sciences, and spiritual development while maintaining religious purity.

The eventual decline began when this spiritual connection weakened, giving way to sorcery and materialism. The Toltecs' later use of magical powers for selfish purposes led to their corruption and the first great catastrophe, demonstrating how spiritual wisdom without ethical application becomes destructive.

**Quick Take**: True civilization flourishes under spiritual governance rather than material power, and ethical deterioration inevitably leads to societal collapse.

## Best Quotes

- "The memory of Nature is infallibly accurate and inexhaustibly minute. A time will come as certainly as the precession of the equinoxes, when the literary method of historical research will be laid aside as out of date, in the case of all original work."

- "Without this knowledge all speculations concerning ethnology are futile and misleading. The course of race development is chaos and confusion without the key furnished by the character of Atlantean civilization and the configuration of the earth at Atlantean periods."

- "The maximum cultivation of which the human intellect is susceptible while it denies itself all the resources of its higher spiritual consciousness, can never be more than a preparatory process as compared with that which may set in when the faculties are sufficiently enlarged to enter into conscious relationship with the super-physical planes or aspects of Nature."

- "It was the Toltec race who developed the highest civilization and organised the most powerful empire of any of the Atlantean peoples, and it was then that the principle of heredity succession was for the first time established."

- "Evolution necessarily means ultimate progress, even though the turning back of its ascending spiral may seem to make the history of politics or of religion a record not merely of development and progress but also of degradation and decay."

## Key Takeaways

- **Ancient Origins**: Human civilization extends millions of years into the past, with highly advanced civilizations preceding our own
- **Cyclical History**: Civilizations rise and fall in cycles based on spiritual development rather than technological advancement alone
- **Psychic Heritage**: Modern humans retain dormant psychic faculties that were once common and can be redeveloped through spiritual training
- **Hidden Records**: Complete historical records exist in the "memory of Nature" and are accessible through higher consciousness development
- **Cultural DNA**: Many modern cultural, religious, and architectural elements derive from Atlantean sources carried by emigrants

## Questions to Consider

- How might our understanding of human potential change if we accepted that psychic abilities were once normal?
- What parallels exist between Atlantean decline and challenges facing modern civilization?
- If accurate historical records exist in higher dimensions, what implications does this have for our approach to knowledge and education?
- How might recognition of cyclical civilization patterns influence our long-term planning and values?
- What responsibility do we have to rediscover and redevelop the latent spiritual faculties of our ancestors?

## Conclusion

This work offers a radical recontextualization of human history that challenges conventional academic paradigms while providing a framework for understanding humanity's spiritual evolution. Whether accepted as literal history or interpreted as allegorical teaching, it presents profound insights into the nature of consciousness, the cyclical patterns of civilization, and the latent potential within human beings.

The book is worth your time if you're drawn to alternative historical perspectives, esoteric teachings, or the possibility that human potential extends far beyond current scientific understanding. Its greatest value lies in its comprehensive vision of human evolution spanning millions of years, suggesting that our current civilization represents not a pinnacle of achievement but one stage in a much larger developmental spiral.

For those willing to consider that written records represent only a fragment of human history, and that consciousness itself might be the key to accessing complete knowledge of our past, this work provides both a detailed historical account and a roadmap for developing the faculties needed to verify its claims for oneself.
