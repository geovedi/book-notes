## Summary

This enchanting collection contains two beloved early 20th-century novels that tell interconnected stories of orphan girls finding their way in the world. "Daddy Long-Legs" follows Jerusha "Judy" Abbott, an orphan who catches the attention of a mysterious trustee who sends her to college, asking only that she write him letters about her education. The sequel "Dear Enemy" shifts focus to Judy's friend Sallie McBride, who reluctantly takes over as superintendent of the reforming John Grier Home orphanage.

Both novels explore themes of education, social reform, independence, and love while maintaining a delightful epistolary format that brings readers intimately close to the characters' thoughts and emotions. These works blend social commentary with romance and humor, creating stories that feel both socially conscious and deeply personal.

Readers who appreciate character-driven historical fiction, feminist literature before its time, and heartwarming transformations will find these novels deeply satisfying. The books offer both nostalgia for a simpler era and surprisingly progressive ideas about women's independence and social responsibility.

## Core Stories

### Daddy Long-Legs: The Orphan's Education

Jerusha Abbott, the oldest orphan at the bleak John Grier Home, lives a life of institutional drudgery until one "Blue Wednesday" when her fate changes dramatically. A wealthy trustee (whom she nicknames "Daddy Long-Legs" after seeing only his tall shadow) is impressed by her essay and offers to send her to college. His conditions are simple: she must become a writer, and she must write him monthly letters about her progress but expect no replies.

Through Judy's letters, we witness her transformation from a sheltered orphan into an educated, confident young woman navigating college life, forming friendships, and discovering her identity. Her vivid personality shines through her correspondence as she experiences everything from having her own clothes to understanding literature for the first time. The letters chronicle her intellectual awakening, social growth, and romantic feelings for Jervis Pendleton, a wealthy young man she meets who seems connected to her mysterious benefactor.

> "Jerusha had an imagination—an imagination, Mrs. Lippett told her, that would get her into trouble if she didn't take care—but keen as it was, it could not carry her beyond the front porch of the houses she would enter."

**Quick Take**: Education transforms not just minds but lives, opening doors to worlds previously unimaginable.

### Dear Enemy: The Superintendent's Awakening

Sallie McBride, Judy's vivacious college friend, finds herself reluctantly accepting the position of superintendent at the John Grier Home when Judy and Jervis Pendleton (now married and wealthy) fund its reform. Sallie, who sees herself as completely unsuited to institutional work, begins writing letters to Judy documenting her struggles and triumphs.

What begins as a temporary duty evolves into a calling as Sallie works to transform the cold, institutional orphanage into a place of warmth and growth. Her letters reveal her growing dedication to the children, her battles with institutional inefficiency, and her contentious relationship with Dr. Robin MacRae, the stern medical advisor she initially calls "Dear Enemy" in frustration. The fire that destroys part of the asylum becomes a catalyst for transformation both for the institution and for Sallie herself.

> "I detest him on sight, and he detests me. Oh, we're going to have a sweet time working together!"

**Quick Take**: Sometimes our greatest growth comes from challenges we never wanted but discover we were meant to face.
