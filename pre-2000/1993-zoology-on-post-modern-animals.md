# Zoology: On (Post) Modern Animals
**Original Title**: Zoology. On (Post) Modern Animals
**Authors**: Bart Verschaffel & Mark Verminck (Editors) | **Year**: 1993

## Summary
This interdisciplinary collection examines humanity's complex and often contradictory relationship with animals in contemporary society. Published for Antwerp 93, Cultural Capital of Europe, the book brings together essays, stories, poetry, and visual commentary from European writers, artists, philosophers, and scientists to explore how modern humans perceive, relate to, and represent animals.

The book positions the zoological garden as the ultimate symbol of our ambivalent attitudes toward animals—places where we cage creatures because we love them, fear them, and wish to distinguish ourselves from them simultaneously. Through a diverse range of contributions, the work investigates how our relationships with animals reflect deeper questions about human identity, modernity, and the boundaries between nature and culture.

This collection will benefit readers interested in cultural studies, philosophy, animal studies, and contemporary European thought. It offers profound insights into how our treatment of animals reveals fundamental truths about human nature, modern society's relationship with the natural world, and the ways animals function as mirrors for our own desires, fears, and projections.

## Core Insights

### The Zoo as Modern Metaphor
The zoological garden represents the paradoxical heart of modern human-animal relationships—a space that is simultaneously Garden of Eden and Noah's ark, circus and amusement park, ghetto and jail. The zoo embodies our desire to control, study, and display nature while maintaining safe boundaries. Animals are caged "because we love them, but also because they frighten us and fascinate us, amuse us and distinguish us from them." This space reveals how modern humans attempt to dominate nature while desperately seeking connection with it.

> "The 'zoo', that nineteenth-century metropolitan area of town for animals, is at the same time Garden of Eden and Noah's ark, circus and amusement park, ghetto and jail"

**Quick Take**: The zoo serves as a powerful metaphor for how modern society simultaneously loves, fears, exploits, and studies the natural world, revealing our fundamental ambivalence about our place within nature.

### Animals as Cultural Projections
Modern humans project their own values, fears, and fantasies onto animals, transforming them into cultural symbols rather than recognizing them as independent beings. The book questions whether traditional animal symbolism—the courageous lion, sly fox, wise owl—still holds meaning in postmodern society, or whether these representations reveal more about human psychology than about animal nature. This projection tendency prevents genuine understanding of animals as individuals with their own existence beyond human interpretation.

> "Are animals individuals or is that one of our inevitable projections?"

**Quick Take**: We often see animals as reflections of ourselves rather than as independent creatures, limiting our ability to form authentic relationships with the natural world.

### Modernity's Impact on Animal Perception
The book explores how modernity, with its scientific rationality and technological progress, has transformed human relationships with animals. From the advent of the railway as the "iron horse" to contemporary media representations, modern rationality has created both distance and new forms of connection. The train symbolizes how modern technology has altered our perception of nature and our place within it, creating both separation and new ways of understanding the world.

> "In the advent of the train, man lived through his mystical rebirth: he became modern"

**Quick Take**: Modern technology and rational thinking have fundamentally reshaped how we perceive and relate to animals, creating both new understandings and deeper separations.

### Cross-Cultural Perspectives on Animals
By bringing together contributions from numerous European countries and disciplines, the book demonstrates how different cultures and intellectual traditions approach human-animal relationships. This diversity reveals that our attitudes toward animals are culturally constructed rather than universally determined. The collection functions as a meeting point for different genres—poetry, literary criticism, essays, visual arts—showing how multiple perspectives can enrich our understanding of complex relationships.

> "Zoology. On (post)modern animals functions as a meeting-point and welcomes authors from numerous countries. Its purpose is to blend and merge into one the many genres which constitute Western written culture"

**Quick Take**: Understanding our relationship with animals requires multiple perspectives from different cultures and disciplines, as no single viewpoint can capture the complexity of these connections.

### The Question of Animal Individuality
The collection challenges readers to consider whether animals can be understood as individuals rather than merely as species representatives or symbols. This question has profound implications for ethics, conservation, and how we structure our relationships with non-human life. Recognizing animal individuality would require fundamental changes in how we treat animals in science, entertainment, agriculture, and daily life.

> "What is the place of the animals in our times? How do we relate to them — in the media, for instance? Has a new imagination with regard to the animals come into existence?"

**Quick Take**: Moving beyond seeing animals as species representatives to recognizing them as individuals could transform our ethical relationships with the natural world.

## Best Quotes

- "Man has an ambiguous relationship with animals. He classifies and studies them, adopts them as pets, or rather, he anxiously keeps them outside, he lets them be of service or manipulates them, cuddles them, eats them"

- "The place where all these ambiguous and contradictory attitudes are found at the same time, is undoubtedly the zoological garden: a place where the animal is caged because we love it, but also because it frightens us and fascinates us, amuses us and distinguishes us from them"

- "Is the lion still 'courageous', the fox still 'sly', and the owl still 'wise' as the mythical animals in olden days?"

- "This book cannot be allocated to one single discipline. Its theme reaches beyond literature, sociology or philosophy. It is thematically open and can be approached in many different ways"

- "Poetry and literary criticism, short story and essay, textual commentary and image, new and classic texts, share a propinquity, and supplement each other"

## Conclusion

**Zoology: On (Post) Modern Animals** is a profound, interdisciplinary exploration of one of humanity's most fundamental relationships—our connection to the animal kingdom. By bringing together diverse perspectives from literature, philosophy, art, and science, the book reveals the complexity, contradiction, and cultural significance of how modern humans relate to non-human animals.

The book's greatest strength lies in its refusal to provide simple answers or advocate for a single perspective. Instead, it embraces the ambiguity and complexity of human-animal relationships, recognizing that these connections reflect deeper questions about human identity, modernity, and our place in the natural world. The diverse contributions create a rich tapestry of ideas that challenges readers to examine their own relationships with animals more critically.

This is essential reading for anyone interested in animal studies, cultural criticism, or understanding the philosophical underpinnings of contemporary environmental and animal rights movements. While its academic approach can be challenging, the book rewards patient readers with insights that resonate far beyond the specific topic of zoology, touching on fundamental questions about how we construct meaning, identity, and ethics in the modern world. The biggest reason to read this book is its ability to transform how you see not only animals, but the entire framework of human relationships with the natural world.
