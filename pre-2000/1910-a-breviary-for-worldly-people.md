# A Breviary for Worldly People
**Original Title**: Brevier für Weltleute: Essays über Gesellschaft, Mode, Frauen, Reisen Lebenskunst, Kunst, Philosophie
**Author**: Oscar A. H. Schmitz | **Year**: 1910

## Summary
This sophisticated collection of essays offers a comprehensive guide to worldly life and social philosophy in early 20th century Europe. Schmitz examines the intricate codes of conduct, social conventions, and aesthetic principles that governed aristocratic and bourgeois society during the fin de siècle era. Written with the wit and psychological insight reminiscent of French moralists, the book serves as both a celebration and critique of European high society's declining traditions.

The essays provide essential reading for anyone interested in understanding the subtle arts of social navigation, the psychology of gender relations, and the philosophy of lifestyle that defined an era. Readers will gain valuable insights into the timeless dynamics of human interaction, cultural sophistication, and the delicate balance between convention and authenticity.

## Core Insights

### The True Value of Social Conventions
Conventions are not mere restrictions but the essential grammar of social interaction. Schmitz argues that true culture lies in mastering these forms rather than being enslaved by them. Conventions serve as protective barriers that preserve personal dignity and prevent the vulgar exposure of private matters to public scrutiny. They are the "game rules of culture" that, when properly understood, provide freedom rather than limitation.

> "The conventions are game rules of culture. Whoever fulfills them without forgetting this will never suffer under them. Nothing is more uncultured than taking them too seriously, whether as their obedient or enraged slave, or as their hostile freedman."
> _Original: "Die Konventionen sind gewissermaßen die Spielregeln der Kultur. Wer bei ihrer Erfüllung dies nicht vergißt, wird niemals unter ihnen leiden. Nichts ist unkultivierter, als sie zu ernst zu nehmen..."_

**Quick Take**: Master social conventions to gain freedom, not to become their servant. True sophistication means knowing when to follow the rules and when to gracefully bend them.

### The Illusion of "Naturalness"
Authenticity has become the new pose in modern society. Schmitz deconstructs the romantic notion of "returning to nature" by showing that genuine naturalness is actually the product of refined culture, not its rejection. The most natural people are those who have so thoroughly mastered social forms that they can move through them with unconscious ease.

> "Naturalness today is here and there the result of fine, experienced culture that has critically passed through all the errors of the time to finally arrive at simple authenticity."
> _Original: "Natürlichkeit ist heute hier und da wieder das Ergebnis feiner, erfahrener Kultur, die kritisch durch alle Irrtümer der Zeit hindurchgegangen ist, um schließlich bei der einfachen Echtheit anzukommen."_

**Quick Take**: True naturalness comes from mastering culture, not rejecting it. The most authentic people are often the most culturally sophisticated.

### The Genius of Femininity
Schmitz presents a nuanced view of female intelligence and creativity, arguing that women's genius manifests differently from men's—not in measurable individual achievements, but in their inspirational and life-giving qualities. Women are the "born guardians of the poetic in life" and possess a natural wisdom that transcends male intellectualism.

> "The value of man lies in what he makes of himself. The value of woman lies in her very being. The twenty-year-old girl is something perfect, she is simply there, has achieved nothing, needs to achieve nothing, and a highly distinguished man considers himself happy if she only consents to be by his side, as lovely and wise as she is."
> _Original: "Der Wert des Mannes liegt in dem, was er aus sich macht. Der Wert der Frau liegt in ihrem Dasein schlechthin. Das zwanzigjährige Mädchen ist etwas Vollkommenes, es ist einfach da, hat nichts geleistet, braucht nichts zu leisten..."_

**Quick Take**: Feminine genius operates through inspiration and being rather than achievement and doing. This complementary wisdom is essential to a balanced society.

### The Decline of Chivalry
The essays mourn the erosion of traditional relations between the sexes, where the concept of the "Lady" provided the foundation for male chivalry. Schmitz suggests that as women seek equality with men, they sacrifice the special reverence that once protected and elevated them. The result is a society where relations between genders become merely competitive rather than complementary.

> "Chivalry is the noblest expression of strength that has become so conscious and self-evident that it can dispense with its emphasis, indeed sometimes assume the mask of service."
> _Original: "Ritterlichkeit ist der edelste Ausdruck der Kraft, die sich so bewußt und selbstverständlich geworden ist, daß sie auf ihre Betonung verzichten, ja bisweilen die Maske des Dienens annehmen kann."_

**Quick Take**: True gender equality doesn't mean women should become like men, but that both sexes should maintain their distinctive virtues while respecting each other's unique contributions.

### The Psychology of Fashion and Taste
Fashion reveals more about social psychology than personal preference. Schmitz analyzes how clothing choices reflect cultural values, class aspirations, and individual character. He distinguishes between true taste (an expression of natural affinity) and fashion slavery (a desperate attempt at social climbing).

> "Under tasteless people one understands not those who place no value on appearance, but precisely those who do, but not for aesthetic reasons, but to attract attention, to distinguish possession differences and the like."
> _Original: "Unter geschmacklosen Menschen versteht man nicht etwa solche, die keinen Wert aufs Äußere legen, sondern gerade solche, die es tun, aber nicht aus ästhetischen Gründen, sondern um aufzufallen, Besitzunterschiede zu bezeichnen und dgl."_

**Quick Take**: Good taste stems from knowing yourself, not from following trends. The most stylish people are those who express their genuine nature through their choices.

## Best Quotes

- "True shame refers not to nakedness but to desires. One is ashamed of nakedness only indirectly, in that it can arouse or show desires."
  _Original: "Das echte Schamgefühl bezieht sich nicht auf die Nacktheit, sondern auf die Begierden. Der Nacktheit schämt man sich nur mittelbar, indem sie Begierden zu entfachen vermag oder zeigt."_

- "Whoever has only one right to appeal against the judgment of facts has lost the measure of facts, the practical possibilities, must inevitably fall into gossip."
  _Original: "Wer nur noch das Urteil der Tatsachen gegen das Urteil der Fakten anrufen kann, hat den Maßstab der Tatsachen, der praktischen Möglichkeiten, notgedrungen verloren und wird dem Geschwätz verfallen."_

- "The artist underlies in Monte Carlo less the temptation of the game than the players. He visits Moulin Rouge less to buy women than to wonder or delight in the life of these women."
  _Original: "Der Künstler unterliegt in Monte Carlo weniger dem Reiz des Spiels, als dem der Spieler. Er besucht Moulin Rouge weniger, um sich Frauen zu kaufen, sondern um sich über das Leben dieser Frauen zu wundern oder zu entzücken."_

- "The most important requirement is that a woman, if she deviates in any way from the path of bourgeois moral prescriptions, knows exactly what she is doing and does not misjudge the scope of her step through false teachings or thoughtlessness."
  _Original: "Die wichtigste Forderung ist, daß eine Frau, wenn sie irgendeinen Schritt von dem Pfade der bürgerlichen Moralvorschriften abweicht, ganz genau weiß, was sie tut, und nicht durch falsche Lehren oder Gedankenlosigkeit die Tragweite ihres Schritts verkennt."_

## Questions to Consider

- How much of our "natural" behavior is actually culturally conditioned?
- What social conventions serve genuine human connection versus merely maintaining social control?
- How can we maintain meaningful gender differences while ensuring equal respect and opportunity?
- What role do social forms play in preserving individual freedom rather than restricting it?

## Conclusion
Schmitz's "Breviary for Worldly People" remains surprisingly relevant despite being written over a century ago. His insights into social psychology, gender dynamics, and cultural sophistication transcend their particular historical moment and speak to timeless human concerns. While some attitudes reflect the patriarchal assumptions of his era, the underlying psychological observations are remarkably penetrating.

The book is absolutely worth your time if you're interested in the subtle arts of social navigation, cultural sophistication, or understanding the psychological foundations of human interaction. Its greatest value lies in teaching readers to see social conventions not as meaningless restrictions but as the visible grammar of invisible human connections. Schmitz masterfully demonstrates that true freedom in society comes not from rejecting all forms, but from mastering them so thoroughly that they become second nature—allowing authentic self-expression within, rather than in opposition to, cultural refinement.
