# Jeeves and the Feudal Spirit
**Authors**: P.G. Wodehouse | **Year**: 1954

## Summary
Bertie Wooster returns home to find his faithful valet Jeeves has returned from holiday, just in time to help navigate another typically complex social predicament. Bertie has grown a moustache during Jeeves's absence, which immediately causes problems by making him unexpectedly attractive to Florence Craye—a woman he's desperately trying to avoid marrying. Meanwhile, Bertie's Aunt Dahlia needs him to entertain the tedious Trotters to secure a business deal, and a young playwright named Percy Gorringe is seeking funding to dramatize Florence's novel.

The plot spirals into classic Wodehouse chaos: Bertie gets arrested for tripping a policeman while helping Florence escape, spends a night in jail, and appears before a magistrate who happens to be his romantic rival's uncle. Through Jeeves's brilliant manipulations and a particularly potent hangover cure, everything resolves itself—Florence ends up with the secretly wealthy Percy (who writes detective stories as Rex West), Aunt Dahlia secures her business deal, and Bertie, recognizing the dangers of being too fascinating, nobly sacrifices his beloved moustache.

**Perfect for**: Fans of classic British humor, literary escapism, and sophisticated comedy of manners. Readers who enjoy clever wordplay, intricate plotting, and the comforting certainty that Jeeves will always sort everything out in the end.

## Fast-Track Story Guide

### The Setup
Bertie Wooster, our genial but dim-witted aristocrat, finds himself in his usual predicament—multiple social obligations that threaten to end in disaster. His beloved valet Jeeves has just returned from holiday, and Bertie has foolishly grown a moustache that makes him unexpectedly irresistible to Florence Craye, a formidable intellectual he's been engaged to before and desperately wants to avoid.

> "As I sat in the bath tub, soaping a meditative foot and singing, if I remember correctly, 'Pale Hands I Loved Beside the Shalimar', it would be deceiving my public to say that I was feeling boomps-a-daisy."

**Quick Take**: Bertie's moustache becomes the catalyst for all his troubles, proving that even small changes can have massive consequences in the rarefied world of Wodehouse's England.

### The Complications
The plot thickens with several intertwined problems: Aunt Dahlia needs Bertie to entertain the boring Trotters for business reasons, Percy Gorringe wants £1000 to produce Florence's play, and Florence herself is causing chaos by being engaged to Stilton Cheesewright while still pursuing Bertie. When Bertie helps Florence escape a policeman, he gets arrested and spends the night in jail.

> "I was scooped in by the constabulary...I spent the night in a prison cell and had rather a testing morning with the magistrate at Vinton Street police court."

**Quick Take**: Classic Wodehouse escalation where minor social inconveniences spiral into major legal complications.

### The Resolution
Through Jeeves's masterful manipulation—including a spectacularly effective hangover cure for Mr. Trotter—everything resolves perfectly. Florence discovers Percy is actually the successful detective writer Rex West and happily redirects her affections to him. Aunt Dahlia gets her business deal, and Bertie, recognizing that his moustache makes him dangerously attractive, nobly sacrifices it.

> "That moustache of mine...I saw clearly that it had made me too fascinating. There peril lurked. When you become too fascinating, all sorts of things are liable to occur which you don't want to occur."

**Quick Take**: Jeeves solves everyone's problems through invisible puppet-mastery, while Bertie's sacrifice shows unexpected self-awareness.
