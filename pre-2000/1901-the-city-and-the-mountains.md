# The City and the Mountains
**Original Title**: A Cidade e as Montanhas
**Author**: José Maria de Eça de Queirós | **Year**: 1901 (written 1895)

## Summary
"The City and the Mountains" is a satirical philosophical novel that chronicles the transformation of Jacinto, a wealthy Portuguese nobleman who lives in Paris and worships urban civilization above all else. His philosophy is simple: "Only in the City, Zé Fernandes, can Man proudly affirm that he has a soul!" Jacinto surrounds himself with every technological marvel and comfort that 19th-century Paris can offer, from electric lights to phonographs, believing these artifacts represent the pinnacle of human achievement and spiritual development.

The narrative, told through the eyes of his friend José Fernandes, follows Jacinto's dramatic journey when inheritance forces him to visit his family estate in the Portuguese mountains. Initially terrified of rural life and convinced that nature reduces humans to mere beasts concerned only with "feeding and breeding," Jacinto gradually discovers that true civilization may lie not in technological gadgets but in genuine human connection, meaningful work, and harmony with nature. His transformation represents a powerful critique of modern materialism and a celebration of traditional rural values.

This novel appeals to readers interested in philosophical questions about modernity, the nature of progress, and the tension between urban sophistication and rural authenticity. It offers timeless insights about what constitutes a meaningful life and challenges our assumptions about civilization and barbarism.

## Core Insights

### The Illusion of Urban Superiority
Jacinto begins as the ultimate advocate for urban civilization, dismissing religion as "merely the over-development of a rudimentary instinct" while worshipping technology like the telephone and phonograph as proof of human superiority. His Paris apartment at No. 202 becomes a temple of modern conveniences—electric lights, temperature controls, even a lift for a two-story building—yet despite all this "civilization," Jacinto grows increasingly thin, weary, and spiritually empty. His elaborate technological cocoon fails to provide genuine happiness or meaning.

> "Only in the City, Zé Fernandes, can Man proudly affirm that he has a soul!"

**Quick Take**: Modern conveniences and technological progress don't automatically equate to spiritual or intellectual advancement; true civilization requires something deeper than gadgets and comfort.

### Nature as Spiritual Teacher
When forced to visit his mountain estate at Tormes, Jacinto initially experiences rural life as humiliating and terrifying. He fears scorpions in every lump of earth, considers wild flowers poisonous, and believes that in nature humans revert to mere "stomach and phallus." Yet gradually, the mountains teach him what Paris couldn't—that meaningful work, authentic relationships, and connection to the natural world provide sustenance that technology cannot match. The physical labor of managing his estate becomes genuinely fulfilling rather than demeaning.

**Quick Take**: Nature offers spiritual and psychological benefits that urban civilization often lacks; physical work and connection to the land can be more ennobling than technological sophistication.

### The Poverty of Modern Intellectualism
During Zé Fernandes's return visit to Paris, he witnesses the degradation of intellectual life at the Sorbonne, where students disrupt serious lectures with "whistles, howls, whinnies and cockadoodle-dos" because "they don't want ideas." This scene reveals Eça de Queirós's critique of modern education and culture, suggesting that civilization without genuine intellectual curiosity and respect for knowledge becomes merely sophisticated barbarism. The students prefer "songs and other such rubbish" to substantial ideas.

> "It's always like this now, in all the classes. They don't want ideas. I think what they want are songs and other such rubbish. They just love making fun."

**Quick Take**: True civilization requires intellectual substance and respect for knowledge, not just the appearance of sophistication; education without genuine learning creates sophisticated ignorance.

### Materialism vs. Meaning
Jacinto's Paris life demonstrates the emptiness of material accumulation without purpose. His 30,000 books remain unread, his technological gadgets serve no real function, and his social obligations feel increasingly meaningless. In contrast, his life at Tormes, while simpler, provides genuine purpose through managing the estate, caring for the local people, and building authentic relationships. The novel suggests that meaning comes not from having more but from doing more that matters.

**Quick Take**: A life of material abundance without meaningful purpose feels more impoverished than a simpler life filled with purposeful activity and genuine relationships.

### The Synthesis of True Civilization
Ultimately, Jacinto doesn't reject all aspects of civilization when he moves to the mountains. Instead, he creates a synthesis—bringing useful knowledge and improvements to rural life while embracing its authentic values. He marries his cousin Joaninha, raises a family, and becomes a benevolent landlord who improves conditions for his tenants. The novel suggests that true civilization combines the best of urban knowledge with rural wisdom and values, creating something richer than either alone.

**Quick Take**: The most fulfilling life may integrate urban knowledge and rural values, creating a synthesis that honors both progress and tradition, technology and nature.

- "Only in the City, Zé Fernandes, can Man proudly affirm that he has a soul!"
- "This is Civilisation!" (Zé Fernandes's ironic response to Jacinto's technological excesses)
- "One of the drawbacks is the terrible squalor in which the local people live. There is genuine poverty here, which is the reverse side of all this beauty. The houses in the village and the tenants' houses are out-and-out hovels, not even fit for cattle – and this is entirely the fault of the landlords."
- "Goodbye, then, because I won't be back! You won't catch me again stuck in the mud of your vice and the dust of your vanity! And whatever good qualities you may have – whatever clear, elegant genius – I will receive in the Mountains by post!"
- "And it did seem to me that, along those paths, through gentle, rural Nature, my Prince, burned brown by the mountain sun and wind, my cousin Joaninha – that tender, smiling mother – the two representatives of their blessed tribe, and I – far now from bitter illusions and false delights – were treading an eternal soil, eternally solid, with a contented heart, and that God was contented with us too, as we serenely, confidently climbed up to the Castle of Great Good Fortune!"

2. How do you balance the benefits of modern convenience with the human need for authentic connection and purpose?
3. In what ways might your own lifestyle prioritize appearances over genuine substance and meaning?
4. Can we create a synthesis of urban and rural values, or must we choose between them?

## Conclusion

"The City and the Mountains" remains remarkably relevant over a century after its creation, speaking directly to contemporary concerns about technological alienation, urban disconnection, and the search for authentic meaning in a materialistic world. Eça de Queirós's critique of hollow civilization feels more urgent than ever in our age of digital distraction and virtual relationships.

This book is absolutely worth your time if you've ever questioned whether modern life is making us happier or merely busier, if you've felt the pull of a simpler, more authentic way of living, or if you're seeking a deeper understanding of what constitutes true progress. The novel's greatest strength lies in its balanced perspective—it doesn't simply romanticize rural life or condemn urban civilization, but thoughtfully explores how we might create lives that combine the best of both worlds.

The journey of Jacinto from urban sophisticate to fulfilled country gentleman offers a powerful template for reimagining our own relationship with technology, nature, and the search for meaning. It suggests that the most "civilized" life may not be the one with the most gadgets or conveniences, but the one that best aligns with our deepest human needs for purpose, connection, and harmony with the natural world.
