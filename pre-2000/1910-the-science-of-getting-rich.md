**Authors**: Wallace D. Wattles | **Year**: 1910
**Category**: Business & Finance

## Summary
 Wallace D. Wattles presents a revolutionary approach to wealth creation that transforms getting rich from a competitive struggle into a creative science. The book argues that there's an exact science to acquiring wealth, governed by specific laws that anyone can learn and apply with mathematical certainty. Wattles introduces the concept of a "Formless Substance" or "Thinking Stuff" from which all things are made, and explains how our thoughts directly influence this substance to create tangible results. The core premise is that getting rich isn't about competing for limited resources, but about creating new wealth through the power of thought, gratitude, and purposeful action.

This book is ideal for entrepreneurs, business professionals, and anyone seeking financial freedom who understands that wealth creation begins with mindset. Readers will learn a systematic approach to prosperity that combines mental discipline with practical action, making it especially valuable for those who feel stuck in traditional competitive thinking or limited by scarcity mindsets.

## Core Insights

### The Creative vs. Competitive Mindset
The fundamental distinction between creative and competitive mindsets forms the foundation of Wattles' philosophy. Most people approach wealth from a competitive perspective—believing there's a limited supply of money and resources that must be fought over. Wattles reveals this as a flawed premise because the universe is made of "Formless Substance" that is inexhaustible and constantly creating more. When you shift from competing for existing resources to creating new wealth, you tap into the unlimited potential of the universe. The creative mindset understands that your success doesn't require others' failure, and that there's abundance enough for everyone who follows the creative principles. This mental shift alone can transform your relationship with money and opportunity.

> _Original: "You must get rid of the thought of competition. You are to create, not to compete for what is already created."_
**Quick Take**: Stop fighting over slices and start baking bigger pies—wealth creation is about expansion, not distribution.

### The Power of Thought in Manifestation
Wattles establishes that thought is the primary force that shapes physical reality. He introduces the concept that there's a "Thinking Stuff" from which all things are made, and when you hold a clear thought of what you want in this substance, it begins the process of creating that thing in physical form. This isn't vague daydreaming—it requires forming a clear, definite mental image of what you desire and holding it consistently with unwavering faith. The more detailed and vivid your mental picture, the faster the creative forces work to bring it into reality. This principle operates regardless of your current circumstances or past experiences—thought is always the cause, and physical manifestation is the effect.

**Quick Take**: Your thoughts are the architects of your reality—build your mental blueprint with precision and consistency.

### Gratitude as the Accelerator
Gratitude isn't merely a polite gesture in Wattles' system—it's the essential element that connects you with the Formless Intelligence and speeds the manifestation process. When you live in a state of genuine gratitude for what you have and what's coming to you, you create a harmonious relationship with the creative forces of the universe. Gratitude keeps your mind fixed on abundance rather than lack, prevents you from slipping into competitive thinking, and strengthens your faith. The Law of Gratitude operates on the principle that action and reaction are always equal—your grateful thanksgiving is a force that goes out and returns as increased blessings.

> "The grateful outreaching of your mind in thankful praise to the Supreme is a liberation or expenditure of force; it cannot fail to reach that to which it is addressed, and the reaction is an instantaneous movement toward you."
> _Original: "The grateful outreaching of your mind in thankful praise to the Supreme is a liberation or expenditure of force; it cannot fail to reach that to which it is addressed, and the reaction is an instantaneous movement toward you."_
**Quick Take**: Gratitude is the emotional frequency that amplifies your creative power—practice it continuously to accelerate your results.

### Purposeful Action in the "Certain Way"
Thinking alone isn't sufficient—Wattles emphasizes that you must act in the "Certain Way" to receive what you've mentally created. This means taking efficient, purposeful action that aligns with your vision while maintaining your creative mindset. The key is to act now, in your present circumstances, with the resources you have, rather than waiting for perfect conditions. Each action should be successful in itself—performed with excellence and integrity. Importantly, you must give more in use value than you receive in cash value, creating a win-win exchange that advances life for everyone involved. Action should be inspired and effective, not rushed or desperate.

> "The men and women who practice the foregoing instructions will certainly get rich; and the riches they receive will be in exact proportion to the definiteness of their vision, the fixity of their purpose, the steadiness of their faith, and the depth of their gratitude."
> _Original: "The men and women who practice the foregoing instructions will certainly get rich; and the riches they receive will be in exact proportion to the definiteness of their vision, the fixity of their purpose, the steadiness of their faith, and the depth of their gratitude."_
**Quick Take**: Bridge the gap between vision and reality through consistent, purposeful action that creates value for others.

### The Impression of Increase
Wattles teaches that success comes from holding and radiating the "Impression of Increase" in all your interactions. This means always looking for ways to add value, improve situations, and create more life for everyone you encounter. Whether you're an employee, business owner, or service provider, your focus should be on creating increase rather than merely maintaining status quo. This mindset makes you valuable to others and naturally attracts opportunities and resources. People will instinctively seek you out because they sense that dealing with you leads to expansion and improvement in their own lives.

> "You must give to every man a use value in excess of the cash value you receives, so that each transaction makes for more life."
> _Original: "You must give to every man a use value in excess of the cash value he receives, so that each transaction makes for more life."_
**Quick Take**: Make every interaction an opportunity for expansion—your commitment to increase creates your magnetic attraction to wealth.
