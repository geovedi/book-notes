# Sketches of Young Gentlemen
**Authors**: Charles Dickens | **Year**: 1838

## Summary
Charles Dickens' "Sketches of Young Gentlemen" is a satirical guide that humorously catalogs twelve distinct types of young men in Victorian society. Written as a companion piece to "Sketches of Young Ladies" (which Dickens criticized), this work serves as both social commentary and entertainment, using wit and sharp observation to expose the absurdities and affectations of masculine behavior. Each sketch presents a detailed psychological portrait that remains surprisingly relevant to modern readers, demonstrating how little some aspects of human nature change across centuries.

This satirical gem offers Victorian literature enthusiasts, social historians, and anyone interested in human behavior a delightful journey through the eccentricities of young masculinity. Readers will gain insight into 19th-century social customs while recognizing timeless character types that still populate our world today, from the painfully awkward to the arrogantly confident.

## Core Insights

### The Bashful Young Gentleman
Dickens masterfully portrays the painfully shy young man whose social anxiety manifests in physical disasters. This character becomes so overwhelmed by embarrassment that he creates more attention through his attempts to remain invisible than would occur through normal interaction. His perpetual blushing, clumsiness, and desperate attempts to escape notice make him simultaneously pitiable and comical.

> "The bashful young gentleman always remains as near the entrance of the room as possible, from which position he smiles at the people he knows as they come in, and sometimes steps forward to shake hands with more intimate friends: a process which on each repetition seems to turn him a deeper scarlet than before."

**Quick Take**: Social anxiety often backfires - the more we try to avoid notice, the more conspicuous we become.

### The Out-and-Out Young Gentleman
This archetype represents the arrogant, swaggering young man who affects a rough, masculine exterior while actually revealing deep insecurity. His deliberately loud behavior, disregard for others' comfort, and need to dominate public spaces expose a fragile ego disguised as confidence. Dickens shows how this type creates chaos not through genuine strength but through calculated attention-seeking.

> "In all places of public resort, the out-and-outers are careful to select each a seat to himself, upon which he lies at full length, and (if the weather be very dirty, but not in any other case) he lies with his knees up, and the soles of his boots planted firmly on the cushion."

**Quick Take**: True confidence doesn't require constant validation from others.

### The Very Friendly Young Gentleman
Dickens exposes the manipulative nature of excessive friendliness, showing how overt displays of warmth often mask self-interest. This character invades personal space, monopolizes conversations, and inserts himself into every situation, all while presenting himself as helpful and caring. His apparent generosity serves his own need for importance and attention.

> "I am delighted," said Mincin, hastily advancing, and pressing our hand warmly between both of his, "I am delighted, I am sure, to make your acquaintance—(here he smiled)—very much delighted indeed—(here he exhibited a little emotion)—I assure you that I have looked forward to it anxiously for a very long time."

**Quick Take**: Genuine friendship respects boundaries; excessive familiarity often signals hidden agendas.

### The Military Young Gentleman
This type satirizes young men obsessed with military glamour and trappings without actual service or experience. Their fascination with uniforms, ranks, and ceremonial aspects of military life reveals a romanticization of power and authority divorced from its realities. Dickens shows how this type's obsession with appearance over substance creates a caricature of true military virtue.

> "The whole heart and soul of the military young gentleman are concentrated in his favourite topic. There is nothing that he is so learned upon as uniforms; he will tell you, without faltering for an instant, what the habiliments of any one regiment are turned up with, what regiment wear stripes down the outside and inside of the leg, and how many buttons the Tenth had on their coats."

**Quick Take**: True expertise requires depth, not just surface knowledge of impressive-looking details.

### The Political Young Gentleman
Dickens critiques the young political enthusiast who treats politics as performance rather than principle. This type adopts political opinions as fashion statements, using them to appear sophisticated and important rather than to effect genuine change. His political consciousness serves social climbing rather than social improvement.

**Quick Take**: Political conviction should be driven by principle, not performance.

## Best Quotes

- "As there are some good points about many of them, which still are not sufficiently numerous to render any one among them eligible, as a whole, our respectful advice to the young ladies is, to seek for a young gentleman who unites in himself the best qualities of all, and the worst weaknesses of none."
- "The grand affair of your life will be, to gain and preserve the esteem of your husband. Neither good-nature nor virtue will suffer him to esteem you against his judgment; and although he is not capable of using you ill, yet you will in time grow a thing indifferent and perhaps contemptible; unless you can supply the loss of youth and beauty with more durable qualities."
- "We look over our list, and can neither recommend the bashful young gentleman, nor the out-and-out young gentleman, nor the very friendly young gentleman, nor the military young gentleman, nor the political young gentleman..."
- "From the anxiety we express for the proper behaviour of the fortunate lady after marriage, it may possibly be inferred that the young gentleman to whom we have so delicately alluded, is no other than ourself."

## Conclusion
"Sketches of Young Gentlemen" remains remarkably relevant nearly two centuries after publication, demonstrating how effectively Dickens captured universal human tendencies. His sharp social observations work because they combine humor with genuine insight, using exaggeration to reveal truths about human behavior that persist across time and culture. The book's enduring value lies not just in its entertainment but in its invitation to self-examination.
