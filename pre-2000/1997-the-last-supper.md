# The Last Supper
**Original Title**: L'ultima cena
**Author**: Massimo Recalcati | **Year**: 1997 (New Edition 2024)

## Summary
Massimo Recalcati's "The Last Supper" is a groundbreaking psychoanalytic exploration of anorexia and bulimia that challenges traditional medical and psychiatric approaches. Drawing on Lacanian theory, Recalcati argues that these conditions should not be understood as mere eating disorders but as complex subjective positions that reveal fundamental truths about desire, lack, and the human relationship with the Other (the symbolic order of language and social structures).

The book presents anorexia-bulimia as two poles of the same underlying structure, where anorexia represents the realization of the subject's Ideal through radical refusal, while bulimia manifests the collapse of this Ideal under the pressure of overwhelming drive-related enjoyment. Recalcati's work offers both clinicians and general readers a profound rethinking of these conditions as existential and symbolic crises rather than simply medical pathologies.

This book will benefit mental health professionals, psychoanalysts, students of psychology, and anyone interested in understanding the deeper psychological dimensions of eating disorders. Readers will gain a sophisticated theoretical framework for conceptualizing treatment beyond behavioral modification, learning to see these conditions as meaningful-if-suffering subjective strategies for negotiating fundamental human dilemmas about love, desire, and identity.

## Core Insights

### The Passion for Nothing
At the heart of anorexia-bulimia lies what Recalcati identifies as a "passion for the void." Unlike medical approaches that view these conditions as pathologies of appetite, the psychoanalytic perspective reveals them as passionate relationships with emptiness itself. The anorexic subject defends this emptiness desperately through identification, dedicating their entire being to becoming pure lack-to-be. The bulimic subject, conversely, discovers this emptiness at the conclusion of each binge episode—through vomiting, they empty their body of substance, demonstrating to the Other that no object-sustenance can ever truly fill them.

> "Anorexia-bulimia is a passion for the void in the sense that, despite orienting the subject toward opposite directions (the anorexic choice is the choice of refusing the food-object, that of bulimia is the push toward its limitless devouring), the subject involved nonetheless aims to reach and preserve the void. Because the abolition of the void would mean the abolition of the subject itself."
> _Original: "L'anoressia-bulimia è allora una passione per il vuoto nel senso che, pur orientando il soggetto verso direzioni opposte (la scelta anoressica è la scelta del rifiuto dell'oggetto-cibo, quella bulimica è la spinta alla sua divorazione illimitata), il soggetto che vi è implicato punta comunque a raggiungere e a conservare il vuoto. Perché l'abolizione del vuoto significherebbe in effetti l'abolizione stessa del soggetto."_

**Quick Take**: The core issue isn't about food but about protecting an essential emptiness that makes subjectivity possible.

### Two Circuits: Drive vs. Desire
Recalcati identifies two fundamental circuits operating in anorexia-bulimia: the circuit of drive (pulsional enjoyment) and the circuit of desire. The drive circuit is closed, repetitive, and autoerotic—marked by the compulsive binge-purge cycles of bulimia that exclude the Other. The desire circuit, by contrast, opens toward the Other, rooted in lack and the need for recognition. Anorexia-bulimia represents a failure to properly articulate these two circuits, leading to either the dominance of Ideal over drive (anorexia) or the overwhelming of desire by drive (bulimia).

> "The drive circuit is marked by a fullness, or rather, by a too-much-fullness. The dimension of enjoyment is in fact a real dimension insofar as it excludes by principle the dimension of lack and that of meaning. Its most evident clinical model is represented by the cyclical crises, in perpetual repetition, of bulimia."
> _Original: "Il circuito del godimento è segnato da un pieno, o meglio, da un troppo-pieno. La dimensione del godimento è infatti una dimensione reale in quanto esclude per principio la dimensione della mancanza e quella del senso. Il suo modello clinico più evidente è rappresentato dalle crisi cicliche, in perpetua ripetizione, della bulimia."_

**Quick Take**: Understanding the tension between these two circuits helps explain why traditional approaches focused only on behavior often fail.

### The Last Supper Paradigm
The biblical Last Supper serves as a powerful metaphor for understanding anorexia-bulimia. Like the Gospel account where Christ's final meal among disciples is shadowed by betrayal, the anorexic-bulimic experiences the communal dining table as the site of broken pacts, abandonment, and impending catastrophe. The anorexic-bulimic occupies the position of Judas at the Other's banquet—accepting the Other's offering only to refuse it, attempting to betray the Other that has "betrayed" them by excluding them from love.

> "The Last Supper is the mother scene of the anorexic dream of an integral sublimation of the drive body. So integral that the very renunciation of drive satisfaction realizes the highest possible form of satisfaction. Dream, therefore, of a mastery: it will be the last time, the Last Supper, the really last one! Then enough. Then only the inedible fragrance of the Ideal."
> _Original: "L'Ultima cena è la scena madre del sogno anoressico di una sublimazione integrale del corpo pulsionale. Integrale al punto che è la rinuncia stessa al soddisfacimento pulsionale che realizza la forma più alta di soddisfacimento possibile. Sogno, dunque, di una padronanza: sarà l'ultima volta, l'Ultima cena, l'ultima veramente! Poi basta. Poi solo la flagranza incommestibile dell'Ideale."_

**Quick Take**: The meal becomes not about nourishment but about a symbolic drama of love, betrayal, and existential positioning.

### Separation from the Other
Drawing on Lacan's insights, Recalcati emphasizes anorexia as a radical procedure of separation from the suffocating presence of the Other (often represented by the maternal figure). The "asphyxiating pap" of the Other—the confusion between care and love, between need and desire—threatens to annihilate the subject's singularity. By refusing food, the anorexic carves out a space of difference, saying "no!" to establish that the mother (and by extension, the symbolic Other) must have a desire outside of the subject.

> "It is the child nourished with more love who refuses the nourishment and orchestrates their refusal as a desire (mental anorexia)... Ultimately, by refusing to satisfy the mother's demand, does the child not demand that the mother have a desire outside of them, because this is the path that is missing for them toward desire?"
> _Original: "È il bambino nutrito con più amore a rifiutare il nutrimento e orchestrare il suo rifiuto come un desiderio (anoressia mentale)... In fin dei conti il bambino, rifiutando di soddisfare la domanda della madre, non esige forse che la madre abbia un desiderio fuori di lui, perché è questa la via che gli manca verso il desiderio?"_

**Quick Take**: The refusal to eat is fundamentally a demand for recognition of the subject as a desiring being rather than merely a needy one.

### Eating Nothing: The Paradox of Anorexic Desire
One of Lacan's crucial insights that Recalcati develops is that the anorexic doesn't simply "not eat" but rather "eats nothing." This subtle distinction reveals that the anorexic is still engaged in a relationship with food—one that demonstrates the difference between need and desire. By "eating nothing," the anorexic forces the Other to confront the enigma of desire, refusing to reduce the subject's demand for love to mere nutritional need.

> "It is not not eating, but... eating nothing. The child eats nothing. Eating nothing means imposing on the Other the difference between need and desire. To the subject's question, which is fundamentally a demand for love... one cannot respond with the commercialized logic of consumption."
> _Original: "Non è non mangiare, ma [...] mangiare niente. Il bambino mangia niente. Mangiare niente significa imporre all'Altro la differenza tra il bisogno e il desiderio. Alla domanda del soggetto, che è al suo fondo una domanda d'amore... non si può rispondere con la logica mercificata del consumo."_

**Quick Take**: The anorexic's "eating nothing" is a profound philosophical statement about the irreducibility of human desire to biological need.

## Best Quotes

- "Love demands love. It never ceases to demand it. It demands it... still. Still is the proper name of the fault from which in the Other the demand for love departs."
  _Original: "L'amore domanda l'amore. Non cessa di domandarlo. Lo domanda… ancora. Ancora è il nome proprio della faglia da cui nell'Altro parte la domanda d'amore."_

- "Still, still, still... It is the demand that resonates without words and in a desperate form in the bulimic attack. The 'bad infinity' of the bulimic demand—there is never an Other sufficient to fill it—shows, at its most extreme, the intersection with the demand for love as such."
  _Original: "Ancora, ancora, ancora… È la domanda che risuona senza parole e in una forma disperata nell'attacco bulimico. Il «cattivo infinito» della domanda bulimica – non c'è mai Altro sufficiente a poterla colmare – mostra, nel suo punto più estremo, l'intersezione con la domanda d'amore in quanto tale."_

- "When I eat I try to eat something good, something very good. I always look for this good, very good thing, without ever finding it... Because in effect the very good Thing has been lost forever. It is the Thing that Freud and Lacan speak of. It is the Thing that suffers from the signifier."
  _Original: "Quando mangio cerco di mangiare una cosa buona, una cosa buonissima. Cerco sempre questa cosa buona, buonissima, senza trovarla mai... Perché in effetti la Cosa buonissima è perduta da sempre. È la Cosa di cui parlano Freud e Lacan. È la Cosa che patisce del significante."_

- "The body is the place of the Other. Where the place of the Other is exactly that from which the signifying treatment of the body is carried out."
  _Original: "Il corpo è il luogo dell'Altro. Dove il luogo dell'Altro è esattamente quello da dove si effettua il trattamento significante del corpo."_

- "I eat in the same way I read books. I devour them. I want to get to the end immediately to feel what there is, to see what there is at the end, at the bottom."
  _Original: "Mangio allo stesso modo con il quale leggo i libri. Li divoro. Voglio arrivare subito in fondo per sentire che cosa c'è, per vedere che cosa c'è in fondo, alla fine."_

## Clinical Applications

- **Differential Diagnosis**: Recalcati emphasizes the importance of distinguishing between different structural positions (neurotic, psychotic, perverse) within anorexia-bulimia, as treatment approaches must vary accordingly.

- **Beyond Behavioral Focus**: Rather than focusing on normalizing eating behavior, clinicians should attend to the underlying subjective position and what the symptoms reveal about the subject's relationship to desire, lack, and the Other.

- **The Role of Vomiting**: Vomiting functions not merely as purging but as a real, pre-symbolic anticipation of the paternal function—establishing limits and boundaries where the symbolic function may be deficient.

- **Treatment Setting**: The therapeutic setting must be adapted for anorexic-bulimic patients, emphasizing the therapeutic relationship over symbolic interpretation, particularly in initial stages.

- **Transference Challenges**: The closed, autistic nature of the drive circuit can impede the development of transference in treatment, requiring specific clinical strategies to overcome this obstacle.

## Questions to Consider

1. How might our understanding of eating disorders change if we viewed them not as pathologies of appetite but as meaningful-if-suffering responses to fundamental dilemmas about love, desire, and recognition?

2. What does the "passion for nothing" reveal about contemporary cultural attitudes toward consumption, fulfillment, and the pursuit of satisfaction?

3. How does the concept of "eating nothing" challenge us to think differently about the relationship between physical needs and psychological desires?

4. In what ways might the "Last Supper" paradigm illuminate the broader cultural and religious significance of food and eating in human societies?

5. How does Recalcati's distinction between the circuit of drive and the circuit of desire help explain why purely behavioral approaches to eating disorders often have limited success?

## Conclusion
"The Last Supper" is a profound and challenging work that fundamentally reconceptualizes anorexia and bulimia as complex subjective positions rather than mere medical pathologies. Recalcati's Lacanian framework offers clinicians and readers a sophisticated way to understand these conditions as meaningful-if-tragic responses to fundamental human dilemmas about desire, recognition, and the relationship to the Other.

The book's greatest strength lies in its ability to reveal what eating disorders reveal about the human condition itself—our eternal struggle between need and desire, our fraught relationship with consumption and satisfaction, and our desperate attempts to protect the essential emptiness that makes us who we are. While theoretically dense and sometimes challenging in its Lacanian terminology, the work rewards persistent readers with insights that transcend clinical application and speak to broader questions about contemporary subjectivity.

This book is essential reading for mental health professionals seeking to move beyond purely behavioral or medical models of eating disorders, as well as for anyone interested in psychoanalytic approaches to contemporary suffering. It represents a significant contribution to both clinical theory and our understanding of the complex psychological dimensions of these increasingly prevalent conditions.
