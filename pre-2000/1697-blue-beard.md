## The Story in Minutes

### The Setup
A wealthy nobleman with a striking blue beard seeks marriage among his neighbors, but women are terrified by both his appearance and the mysterious disappearance of his previous wives. Through lavish hospitality and persistence, he wins the hand of the youngest daughter of a local lady.

### The Forbidden Room
Shortly after their marriage, Blue Beard announces a business trip and gives his new wife keys to all the rooms in their castle—with one exception. He strictly forbids her from opening a small closet at the end of the gallery, warning of terrible consequences if she disobeys.

### The Discovery
Despite her initial resolve, curiosity overwhelms the young wife. She opens the forbidden door to find the murdered bodies of Blue Beard's previous wives—all killed for the same transgression. The magical key becomes permanently stained with blood, impossible to clean, sealing her fate when her husband returns.

### The Climax
Blue Beard discovers the blood-stained key and immediately sentences his wife to death. In a desperate race against time, she repeatedly calls to her sister Anne from the tower, watching for her brothers who promised to visit. The famous exchange "Anne, sister Anne, do you see anyone coming?" creates nail-biting tension as Blue Beard grows increasingly impatient.

### The Rescue
At the last moment, the brothers arrive just as Blue Beard is about to execute his wife. They kill him, freeing her from his tyranny. She inherits his wealth and uses it wisely—marrying her sister, securing positions for her brothers, and finding happiness with a new, worthy husband.
