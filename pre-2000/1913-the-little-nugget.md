# The Little Nugget
**Authors**: P. G. Wodehouse | **Year**: 1913
**Category**: Fiction & Literature

## Summary
"The Little Nugget" is a comic novel about the chaotic world surrounding Ogden Ford, a wealthy and thoroughly unpleasant American boy nicknamed "the Little Nugget" by various criminal elements who see him as a valuable prize. After Ogden's parents divorce, his mother Nesta Ford is desperate to regain custody from her wealthy ex-husband Elmer Ford, leading to multiple kidnapping attempts by both amateurs and professionals.

The story shifts perspective between several characters, primarily Peter Burns, an English schoolmaster who becomes reluctantly involved in the schemes, and various professional kidnappers including Smooth Sam Fisher and Buck MacGinnis. The narrative follows the hilarious consequences when multiple parties attempt to kidnap the same child simultaneously.

This early Wodehouse work showcases his developing comic style and talent for farcical situations, featuring mistaken identities, romantic complications, and the author's signature wit. While perhaps not as polished as his later Jeeves and Wooster novels, it demonstrates the elements that would make Wodehouse one of England's most beloved humorists.

## Core Insights

### The Comedy of Failed Schemes
The novel's humor stems from the spectacular failure of every kidnapping attempt, whether by amateurs like Cynthia Drassilis or professionals like Smooth Sam Fisher. Each plot becomes increasingly elaborate and doomed to fail, often because Ogden himself is so thoroughly unlikable that his captors can't wait to be rid of him.

> "He may want intelligent handling, but he's a mighty fine boy."
> _Original: "He may want intelligent handling, but he's a mighty fine boy."_

**Quick Take**: The greater the planning and criminal expertise, the more likely the scheme will fail through absurd coincidences and the target's own unpleasantness.

### Character Transformation Through Crisis
Peter Burns begins as a comfortably wealthy man transformed by heartbreak into someone who finds himself working as a schoolmaster. His involvement with the kidnapping plots ultimately leads to personal growth and romantic resolution, showing how Wodehouse characters often develop through comic misadventures rather than serious drama.

> "I had taken Audrey's unalterable affection for granted. She was the natural complement to my scheme of comfort."

**Quick Take**: Sometimes losing everything is the only way to discover what truly matters.

### Professionalism vs. Amateur enthusiasm
The novel contrasts professional criminals like Smooth Sam Fisher, who approach kidnapping as a business, with wealthy amateurs who treat it as a game. This creates comic tension as the professionals' systematic methods clash with the wealthy characters' naive expectations.

> "I'm one of the Get-Rich-Quick-Wallingfords, and I'm looking out for myself all the time."

**Quick Take**: Professional expertise often fails when faced with the unpredictable chaos of human nature.

## Questions to Consider

- Why do all the characters, including criminals, ultimately find Ogden too unpleasant to keep?
- How does Peter Burns's background as a wealthy man who lost everything inform his actions throughout the story?

## Conclusion

"The Little Nugget" is worth reading as an early example of Wodehouse's developing comic genius, though it lacks the polished perfection of his later masterpieces. The biggest reason to read it is to see how Wodehouse was already perfecting the elements that would make him famous: elaborate farcical plots, romantic complications, and the ability to find humor in the most absurd situations.

While the novel's pacing sometimes drags compared to his later works, and the romantic subplot feels somewhat conventional, the central kidnapping comedy delivers genuine laughs. The book represents an important stepping stone in Wodehouse's career and showcases his unique ability to transform potentially dark subject matter (child kidnapping) into light-hearted comedy through his mastery of farce and witty dialogue.
