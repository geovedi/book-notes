# Romola
**Authors**: George Eliot | **Year**: 1862

## Summary
"Romola" is George Eliot's sweeping historical novel set in Renaissance Florence during the turbulent 1490s. The story follows Romola de' Bardi, the intelligent and virtuous daughter of a blind classical scholar, as she navigates political upheaval, religious revolution, and personal betrayal against the backdrop of Florence's transformation from Medici-controlled republic to theocratic state under Savonarola.

When the charming but opportunistic Greek scholar Tito Melema arrives in Florence, Romola's father adopts him, and Romola falls in love and marries him. However, Tito proves to be morally bankrupt, abandoning his benefactors and betraying everyone who trusts him while maintaining his charming exterior. As political turmoil erupts with the expulsion of the Medici and the rise of the Dominican friar Girolamo Savonarola, Romola finds herself increasingly isolated between her disillusionment with her husband and her growing admiration for Savonarola's moral vision, despite concerns about his methods and claims.

The novel masterfully weaves personal drama with historical events, culminating in Savonarola's tragic execution and Romola's eventual triumph as she finds purpose in raising her husband's illegitimate children and living according to principles of duty and moral integrity.

This deeply philosophical exploration of moral choices, personal responsibility, and the tension between individual conscience and societal change will appeal to readers who appreciate character-driven historical fiction with profound psychological depth and ethical complexity.

## The Essential Plot

**Romola de' Bardi** is the educated, principled daughter of Bardo, a blind scholar obsessed with classical learning. When **Tito Melema**, a handsome Greek fugitive, arrives in Florence claiming to be a scholar, Bardo adopts him. Romola falls in love and marries Tito, unaware he has abandoned his own father in Greece and is fundamentally deceitful.

As Florence undergoes political upheaval with **Girolamo Savonarola** rising to power, Tito betrays multiple benefactors while maintaining his charming facade. He abandons his adoptive father, takes up with Tessa (a simple peasant girl), and engages in political intrigue.

Romola discovers Tito's treachery and attempts to leave him, but returns after a profound spiritual crisis, choosing duty over personal freedom. The novel reaches its climax with Savonarola's arrest, torture, and execution in 1498, which Romola witnesses. Tito meets his own violent end at the hands of his victims.

**The ending reveals Romola years later, having raised Tito's children by Tessa, finding meaning through maternal devotion and unwavering moral integrity rather than personal happiness or recognition.**
