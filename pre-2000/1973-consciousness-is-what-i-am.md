**Author**: Joel S. Goldsmith | **Year**: 1973
**Category**: Spirituality & Religion

## Summary

Joel S. Goldsmith's "Consciousness Is What I Am" presents a profound spiritual teaching that reveals consciousness itself as our true identity. Goldsmith teaches that we are not human beings seeking spiritual experiences, but rather divine consciousness expressing itself through human form. The book guides readers through the process of transcending the false sense of personal self ("eu") to realize their true nature as the infinite "I" — the Divine Consciousness that is God.

This transformative work shows how dedicated spiritual practice, particularly meditation and conscious surrender, can awaken us to our true identity as instruments through which God manifests on Earth. Goldsmith explains that all problems stem from maintaining a false sense of personal identity, and their solution lies in "dying daily" to the human ego and being reborn in spiritual awareness.

Perfect for spiritual seekers, meditation practitioners, and anyone feeling called to move beyond conventional religious practice into direct experience of divine consciousness. Readers will learn practical methods for transcending personal limitation, experiencing divine guidance, and becoming channels for spiritual healing and transformation in the world.

## Core Insights

### The False Sense of Self vs. True Identity

Goldsmith reveals that the root of all human problems lies in maintaining a false sense of personal identity. When we believe ourselves to be separate, limited individuals struggling through life, we create the conditions for suffering, lack, and discord. The solution is to realize our true identity as Divine Consciousness — not as humans expressing God, but as God expressing as humans. This shift from "I am a person seeking God" to "I am God Consciousness appearing as person" transforms every aspect of life.

> "Consciousness is what I Am and, through Consciousness, I have access to the Kingdom of God, to the Infinite."
> _Original: "Consciência é o que Eu Sou e, por intermédio da Consciência, tenho acesso ao Reino de Deus, ao Infinito."_

**Quick Take**: Stop trying to improve yourself as a person and instead realize your true nature as infinite Divine Consciousness.

### The Practice of "Dying Daily"

The author teaches the profound discipline of "dying daily" — consciously letting go of the personal ego sense multiple times throughout each day. This isn't death of the body, but death of the false self that claims personal power, wisdom, and identity. Through regular meditation periods where we surrender our minds and bodies to Divine Consciousness, we gradually transcend the limitations of humanhood and become instruments through which divine intelligence, love, and power flow naturally.

> "Father, I know that You knock at the door of my consciousness, so I am opening my consciousness. Take control of my mind and body. May You be my Soul, be my life."
> _Original: "Senhor, sei que bates à porta da minha consciência, então estou abrindo minha consciência. Assume o controle da minha mente e corpo. Que Tu sejas minha Alma, sejas minha vida."_

**Quick Take**: Regular periods of conscious surrender transform you from a limited person into an instrument of infinite divine intelligence.

### Fourth Dimensional Consciousness

Goldsmith introduces the concept of "Fourth Dimensional Consciousness" — a state of awareness beyond physical, mental, and emotional realms where divine reality becomes directly experienced. In this elevated state, we no longer react to appearances or fear worldly conditions because we recognize that only Spirit is real and only Spiritual Power exists. This consciousness perceives the Kingdom of God as present reality rather than future hope, and demonstrates divine harmony as the natural state of being.

> "When we recognize the Fourth Dimension, that which the Master called the Kingdom of God, we open ourselves to its influence and then we are ready to receive instructions."
> _Original: "Quando, no entanto, reconhecemos a Quarta Dimensão, isso que o Mestre chamou de Reino de Deus, nos abrimos à Sua influência e então estamos prontos para receber instruções."_

**Quick Take**: Spiritual awakening elevates consciousness beyond the three-dimensional world into direct experience of divine reality.

### Divine Consciousness as the Healer

The book teaches that true healing occurs not through technique or personal ability, but through the realization that only Divine Consciousness exists and only Spiritual Power is real. When we stop trying to heal, fix, or improve ourselves or others, and instead realize that God is the only being, presence, and power, healing manifests naturally as the expression of our true nature. The practitioner's role is not to demonstrate personal power but to become so transparent that Divine Consciousness shines through unobstructed.

> "Miracles happen when the 'I' does not enter. When someone asks us for help and we can realize that there is no such person, that there is no such 'I', healing has already begun."
> _Original: "Milagres acontecem quando o 'eu' não entra. Quando alguém nos pede ajuda e podemos perceber que não existe tal pessoa, que não existe esse 'eu', a cura já começou."_

**Quick Take**: True healing happens when we get out of the way and let Divine Consciousness be what It is — the only reality and power.
