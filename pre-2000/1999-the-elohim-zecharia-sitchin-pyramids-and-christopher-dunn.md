# The Elohim, Zecharia Sitchin, Pyramids and Christopher Dunn
**Authors**: Edmund Meadows | **Year**: 1999
**Category**: Spirituality & Religion

## Summary
This provocative work combines ancient astronaut theory with remote viewing to explore claims about the Elohim (biblical gods) as extraterrestrial beings who genetically engineered humanity. Drawing from Zecharia Sitchin's translations of Sumerian texts and Christopher Dunn's engineering analysis of the Great Pyramid, the author presents a controversial alternative history of human civilization and technological development.

The book challenges conventional historical dating, religious interpretations, and technological evolution by proposing that advanced extraterrestrial visitors shaped human development, built ancient monuments, and influenced the formation of major religions. The author incorporates personal remote viewing experiences to validate and expand upon these theories.

This guide appeals to readers interested in alternative archaeology, ancient mysteries, and speculative theories about human origins. It offers a comprehensive synthesis of various fringe theories while challenging readers to question established historical and religious narratives.

## Core Insights

### The Elohim as Ancient Astronauts
The Elohim (also called Nefilim or Anunnaki) are presented as long-lived extraterrestrial beings with lifespans of approximately 500,000 years who visited Earth from the "Twelfth Planet" (Nibiru) every 3,600 years. According to the author's remote viewing research, these beings genetically engineered modern humans from primitive ancestors approximately 2 million years ago.

> "They are also reported to be inter-fertile with Man, and to have created or genetically engineered Man in their image."

**Quick Take**: If ancient humans encountered advanced beings, their technological abilities would have appeared god-like, and their genetic experiments could explain the sudden leap in human evolution.

### The Twelfth Planet Theory
Based on Sitchin's work, the book describes a rogue planet following an elliptical orbit in the opposite direction to other planets. This celestial body visits the inner solar system every 3,600 years, with its last approach occurring around 160 BC. The author suggests the planet appears to be "dead" and radioactive, glows in the dark, and may have once supported the Elohim civilization.

> "It normally receives very little Sun, but its rogue action every 3,600 years would cause a tidal effect that would heat it up."

**Quick Take**: Orbital mechanics and ancient astronomical records could preserve evidence of celestial visitors that mainstream science has overlooked.

### Pyramid Technology and Lost Knowledge
Christopher Dunn's engineering analysis reveals that the Great Pyramid of Giza represents construction precision far beyond modern capabilities. The book suggests this monument served as a technological device rather than merely a tomb, built with tolerances 25 times finer than contemporary construction standards.

> "It appears to be the oldest building still in existence, and the most accurately constructed building ever made. All the tolerances are about 25 times finer than any used in modern building."

**Quick Take**: Ancient structures may encode technological principles that we've yet to rediscover, suggesting cycles of technological advancement and loss.

### The Nordics as Original Engineers
Through remote viewing, the author claims to have discovered that the Elohim were themselves genetically engineered by an older race known as "the Nordics." These telepathic, human-like beings modified ancient apes into proto-humans, inadvertently giving the Elohim speech capabilities that allowed them to escape Nordic control.

> "The Nordics decided to genetically engineer the human ape some 2,000,000 years ago into something in their own image that could survive easily on this planet."

**Quick Take**: Multiple layers of extraterrestrial intervention could explain the complexity of human development and the persistence of genetic manipulation themes in mythology.

### Religious Origins and Control Systems
The book argues that modern Western religion inherited its authoritarian structure, fear of death, and misogynistic elements from the Elohim's attempt to control human populations. This contrasts with Eastern traditions that preserved concepts like reincarnation and polytheism.

> "MODERN WESTERN RELIGION has been moulded by the Elohim. Thus it is misogynist, fearful of death, tyrannical and totalitarian."

**Quick Take**: Religious systems may preserve historical memories of extraterrestrial contact and subsequent power structures, influencing contemporary spiritual beliefs.

## Best Quotes
- "HISTORY is bunk written as propaganda by winners. Probably most dates within the last 2,000 years are as accurate as one can expect."
- "Technology only becomes one's own when one can advance it."
- "Be highly suspicious of all dates BC."
- "We do not have the technology to build it today. On one point however it lacks elegance, and that is its sheer size. It is hi-tech Fred Flintstone style."
- "The greatest responsibility taker around is usually assigned the title of God on the Telepathic Net."

## Critical Questions
- What if ancient religious texts describe actual extraterrestrial events rather than purely spiritual experiences?
- Could ancient monuments represent lost technology rather than primitive construction?
- How might cyclical catastrophic events explain the gaps in the archaeological record?
- What evidence might exist for multiple waves of extraterrestrial intervention in human development?
- If these theories are partially correct, what implications would this have for our understanding of human potential and origins?

## Action Items
- Examine ancient texts through the lens of technological descriptions rather than purely symbolic interpretations
- Study astronomical cycles that might correspond to historical disruptions or advancements
- Explore the engineering capabilities demonstrated by ancient structures with fresh perspective
- Consider how historical narratives might preserve memories of actual events despite cultural distortion
- Approach anomalous archaeological findings with openness to unconventional explanations

## Conclusion
This controversial synthesis of ancient astronaut theory, remote viewing research, and alternative archaeology presents a challenging perspective on human origins and technological history. While highly speculative and lacking conventional academic validation, the book raises important questions about the assumptions underlying mainstream historical and religious narratives.

The value lies not necessarily in its specific claims but in its encouragement to question established paradigms and consider alternative explanations for anomalies in the archaeological and historical record. Readers willing to entertain unconventional possibilities may find fresh perspectives on ancient mysteries, though skeptics will find much to dispute in both methodology and conclusions.

For those interested in alternative theories of human origins, ancient technology, or the intersection of consciousness studies with historical research, this book offers a comprehensive if controversial framework worth exploring with an open but critical mind.
