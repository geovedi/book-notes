Gethryn's life as a responsible prefect is upended when his disreputable Uncle Farnie arrives at Beckford College disguised as a student.

This conflict forms the heart of the story, exploring themes of loyalty, honor, and the challenges of maintaining integrity under pressure.

Leicester's House represents the broader social ecosystem of a British public school, with its strict hierarchies, unwritten codes, and constant negotiations of power.

### The Power of Sportsmanship and Team Unity
