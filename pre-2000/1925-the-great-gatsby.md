# The Great Gatsby
**Authors**: Francis Scott Fitzgerald | **Year**: 1925

## Summary
"The Great Gatsby" is a tragic tale set in the Roaring Twenties, narrated by Nick Carraway, a young Midwesterner who moves to Long Island and becomes neighbors with the mysterious, wealthy Jay Gatsby. The story centers on Gatsby's obsessive quest to recapture his past love with Daisy Buchanan, Nick's married cousin, through elaborate parties and extravagant displays of wealth.

This masterful critique of the American Dream explores themes of wealth, class, love, and the illusion of social mobility. As Gatsby's romantic vision collides with the harsh realities of his society, the novel reveals the moral decay beneath the glamorous surface of Jazz Age excess. Perfect for readers interested in character-driven literary fiction that examines the dark side of ambition and the enduring power of memory.

## The Essential Plot

### The Setup
Nick Carraway arrives in West Egg, a wealthy Long Island enclave, and discovers he lives next door to the enigmatic Jay Gatsby, who throws extravagant parties every weekend. Nick reconnects with his cousin Daisy Buchanan and her brutally wealthy husband Tom, who live in the fashionable East Egg across the bay.

### The Rising Action
Gatsby befriends Nick and eventually reveals his life's obsession: he loves Daisy, whom he knew before World War I, and has accumulated his fortune solely to win her back. Through Nick, Gatsby rekindles his affair with Daisy, culminating in a tense confrontation where Gatsby demands Daisy leave Tom and admit she never loved him.

### The Tragic Turning Point
Daisy, unable to renounce her marriage and comfortable life, accidentally kills Myrtle Wilson (Tom's mistress) while driving Gatsby's car. Gatsby takes the blame to protect Daisy, while George Wilson (Myrtle's husband), believing Gatsby was both his wife's lover and killer, murders Gatsby in his pool before taking his own life.

### The Aftermath
In the novel's devastating conclusion, nearly everyone abandons Gatsby in death—Daisy and Tom flee without attending his funeral, his party guests disappear, and only Nick and Gatsby's elderly father mourn him. Nick becomes disgusted with the moral emptiness of the wealthy elite and returns to the Midwest.

## Key Characters

**Jay Gatsby**: A self-made millionaire with an obsessive romantic vision. Born James Gatz, he reinvented himself to pursue the American Dream and win back Daisy.

**Nick Carraway**: The moral compass of the story, a bonds salesman from Minnesota who becomes both observer and participant in the tragedy.

**Daisy Buchanan**: Gatsby's former lover and Nick's cousin, representing the careless, moneyed class whose beauty masks moral weakness.

**Tom Buchanan**: Daisy's brutish husband, old-money aristocrat who embodies the entitled cruelty of the established elite.

**Jordan Baker**: A professional golfer and friend of Daisy's, representing the cynical, dishonest nature of the upper class.

## Core Themes

### The Corruption of the American Dream
Gatsby's tragic flaw is his belief that wealth can recreate the past and purchase love. His magnificent parties and displays of opulence are ultimately meaningless props in a romantic fantasy that ignores human limitations.

### The Illusion of Class Mobility
The novel sharply contrasts "old money" (the Buchanans) with "new money" (Gatsby). Despite his immense wealth, Gatsby remains an outsider, denied entry into the exclusive social circle he desperately seeks to join.

### Moral Decay Beneath Glamour
Beneath the glittering surface of Jazz Age prosperity lies profound moral emptiness. The wealthy characters move through life with casual cruelty, abandoning responsibilities and relationships when inconvenient.

### The Power and Danger of Memory
Gatsby's inability to accept that the past is irreversible drives his destruction. His idealized memory of Daisy becomes more real to him than the actual person, leading to inevitable tragedy.

- Does Daisy deserve sympathy as a product of her time, or is she simply selfish and weak?

## Conclusion

"The Great Gatsby" remains essential reading because it captures the eternal tension between idealism and reality, ambition and limitation. Fitzgerald's prose is both beautiful and brutal, exposing the glittering lie that money and social status guarantee happiness or moral worth.

The novel is absolutely worth your time—not just for its elegant writing and memorable characters, but for its profound insights into human nature and the American psyche. The biggest reason to read it is to understand how the pursuit of dreams can become both noble and destructive, and how the past continues to shape our present in ways we can't always control. It's a timeless reminder that the most glittering opportunities often hide the darkest truths about human nature.
