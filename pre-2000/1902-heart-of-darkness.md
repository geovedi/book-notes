## Core Insights

### The Illusion vs. Reality of Colonialism
Marlow discovers that the European "civilizing mission" in Africa is actually a brutal enterprise driven by greed and cruelty. The Company's outpost is characterized by decay, inefficiency, and meaningless destruction, revealing colonialism as a hollow justification for exploitation and violence. The grand rhetoric of enlightenment masks the reality of human suffering and environmental destruction.

**Quick Take**: Noble intentions often conceal selfish motives, especially in systems of power and control.

### The Darkness Within Human Nature
The African wilderness acts as a mirror reflecting the inner darkness of European characters. Kurtz's transformation from idealist to tyrant demonstrates how the removal of societal constraints reveals humanity's capacity for evil. The "heart of darkness" is not Africa itself, but the capacity for moral corruption within every human being.

**Quick Take**: Civilization is a thin veneer; under the right conditions, anyone can become capable of terrible things.

### The River as Psychological Journey
Marlow's journey up the Congo River represents a progression deeper into the human psyche. The physical distance from European civilization corresponds to increasing psychological and moral isolation. The river becomes a metaphor for the unconscious mind, with its currents, depths, and dangers representing hidden aspects of human nature.

**Quick Take**: Physical journeys often parallel inner psychological exploration and self-discovery.

### Moral Relativism and Truth
Marlow discovers that truth is relative and context-dependent. He finds himself lying to Kurtz's "Intended" to preserve her idealized memory, questioning whether absolute truth is always valuable or even possible in a morally complex world.
