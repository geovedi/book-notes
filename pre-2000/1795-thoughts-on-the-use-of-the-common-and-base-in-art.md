# Thoughts on the Use of the Common and Base in Art
**Original Title**: Gedanken über den Gebrauch des Gemeinen und Niedrigen in der Kunst
**Author**: Friedrich Schiller | **Year**: 1795

## Summary
Friedrich Schiller's philosophical essay explores how artists can transform ordinary and even base subjects into elevated art through noble treatment and spiritual insight. He distinguishes between what is merely "common" (lacking spiritual depth) and what is "base" (actively coarse and vulgar), arguing that true artistic genius can elevate even the lowest subjects when approached with noble vision.

This work will benefit artists, writers, critics, and anyone interested in aesthetic philosophy, providing timeless insights into how artistic treatment matters more than subject matter, and how true nobility in art comes from the artist's spirit rather than their choice of subjects.

## Core Insights

### The Transformative Power of Noble Treatment
Schiller argues that what matters in art is not the subject itself but how it's treated. A "common" subject is one that appeals only to sensual pleasure without speaking to the spirit. However, even the most common subjects can be elevated through noble treatment that connects them to something spiritual and reveals their greater significance. A superior mind can ennoble the common by discovering its profounder aspects.

> "A superior mind and noble spirit will know how to ennoble even the common, namely by connecting it to something spiritual and discovering a great side to it."
> _Original: "Ein großer Kopf und ein edler Geist hingegen wird selbst das Gemeine zu adeln wissen, und zwar dadurch, daß er es an etwas Geistiges anknüpft und eine große Seite daran entdeckt."_

**Quick Take**: Your artistic perspective elevates or diminishes your subject matter, regardless of what you choose to depict.

### The Critical Distinction: Common vs. Base
Schiller makes a crucial philosophical distinction between the "common" and the "base." The common merely lacks spiritual elevation—negative in its deficiency of noble qualities. The base, however, is positively vulgar, representing coarse feelings, bad morals, and contemptible attitudes. This distinction matters because while the common can be elevated, the base requires careful artistic handling to avoid aesthetic offense.

> "The common merely shows the lack of an advantage that might be desired; the base shows the lack of a quality that can be demanded of everyone."
> _Original: "Das Gemeine zeugt bloß von einem fehlenden Vorzug, der sich wünschen läßt, das Niedrige von dem Mangel einer Eigenschaft, die von jedem gefordert werden kann."_

**Why This Matters**: Understanding this distinction helps artists navigate subject matter choices and treatment with aesthetic confidence.

### When Base Elements Become Artistically Permissible
Schiller identifies specific contexts where base elements can be artistically valuable: comedy and tragedy. In comedy, the base can provoke laughter when there's a clear contrast between refined and vulgar behavior. In tragedy, base actions become acceptable when they transition into the terrifying and the aesthetic offense is overwhelmed by powerful emotional engagement.

> "Whenever the base can be applied in serious and tragic works, it must pass into the terrifying, and the momentary offense to taste must be extinguished by a strong occupation of the emotions."
> _Original: "Alsdann muß es aber ins Furchtbare übergehen, und die augenblickliche Beleidigung des Geschmacks muß durch eine starke Beschäftigung des Affekts ausgelöscht und also von einer höhern tragischen Wirkung gleichsam verschlungen werden."_

**Quick Take**: Base elements work artistically when they serve either comedic contrast or tragic intensity that overwhelms their offensive nature.

### The Paradox of Moral vs. Aesthetic Judgment
One of Schiller's most profound insights is that moral and aesthetic judgments can diverge significantly. A character who commits a seemingly minor crime like theft may be more aesthetically offensive than one who commits murder, because theft suggests cowardice and weakness of character, while murder at least displays the appearance of strength and power.

> "A base action shows a crawling, cowardly disposition; a murderous deed has at least the appearance of strength, at least the degree of our aesthetic interest corresponds to the degree of strength expressed in it."
> _Original: "Ein Diebstahl aber zeigt eine kriechende, feige Gesinnung an; eine Mordthat hat wenigstens den Schein von Kraft, wenigstens richtet sich der Grad unsers Interesse, das wir ästhetisch daran nehmen, nach dem Grad der Kraft, der dabei geäußert worden ist."_

**Why This Matters**: This explains why audiences can be captivated by powerful villains despite their moral depravity—aesthetic power often trumps moral goodness in artistic impact.

### The Limits of Visual vs. Literary Arts
Schiller argues that writers have more freedom than visual artists in depicting base subjects because literature appeals to imagination while visual arts confront the senses directly. Readers can control their mental imagery, but viewers cannot choose what they see in a painting or performance. This makes base elements more tolerable in literature than in visual representation.

> "The poet brings his objects only before the imagination; the painter, however, brings them immediately before the senses. When Homer presents his Ulysses in beggar's rags, it depends on us how far we paint this picture for ourselves. But if the painter wanted to faithfully copy Homer's Ulysses, we would turn away with disgust."
> _Original: "Jener bringt seine Objekte bloß vor die Phantasie, dieser hingegen unmittelbar vor die Sinne. Also ist nicht nur der Eindruck des Gemäldes lebhafter als der des Gedichtes... Wenn uns Homer seinen Ulyß in Bettlerlumpen aufführt, so kömmt es auf uns an, wie weit wir uns dieses Bild ausmalen und wie lang wir dabei verweilen wollen."_

**Quick Take**: Consider your medium carefully—what works in literature may fail in visual art due to immediate sensory impact.

## Best Quotes
- "A common mind will dishonor the noblest material through common treatment; a great mind and noble spirit, however, will know how to ennoble even the common itself."
  _Original: "Ein gemeiner Kopf wird den edelsten Stoff durch eine gemeine Behandlung verunehren; ein großer Kopf und ein edler Geist hingegen wird selbst das Gemeine zu adeln wissen."_

- "The common is opposed to the noble, the base to the noble and the respectable simultaneously."
  _Original: "Das Gemeine ist also dem Edlen, das Niedrige dem Edeln und Anständigen zugleich entgegengesetzt."_

- "True greatness shines all the more gloriously from a lowly fate, and the artist need not fear to present his hero even in a contemptible shell, provided he is certain that the expression of inner worth is at his disposal."
  _Original: "Wahre Größe schimmert aus einem niedrigen Schicksal nur desto herrlicher hervor, und der Künstler darf sich nicht fürchten, seinen Helden auch in einer verächtlichen Hülle aufzuführen, sobald er nur versichert ist, daß ihm der Ausdruck des innern Werths zu Gebote steht."_

- "Yielding to every passion without any resistance, satisfying every impulse without allowing oneself to be restrained even by the rules of decency, let alone those of morality, is base and betrays a base soul."
  _Original: "Jeder Leidenschaft ohne allen Widerstand nachgeben, jeden Trieb befriedigen, ohne sich auch nur von den Regeln des Wohlstands, viel weniger von denen der Sittlichkeit zügeln zu lassen, ist niedrig und verräth eine niedrige Seele."_

## Action Items
- **Elevate your subjects**: Look for the spiritual dimension in ordinary subjects and reveal their deeper significance through your artistic treatment
- **Know your boundaries**: Understand the difference between common (lacking nobility) and base (actively vulgar) subject matter
- **Use contrast strategically**: If incorporating base elements, ensure they serve either comedic effect or tragic intensity that overwhelms their offensiveness
- **Consider your medium**: Remember that visual arts have stricter limitations than literature regarding base subject matter
- **Focus on inner nobility**: When depicting characters in lowly circumstances, emphasize their inner spiritual worth rather than their external condition

## Questions to Consider
- How does your artistic perspective either elevate or diminish the subjects you choose to portray?
- Where is the line between challenging your audience and offending their aesthetic sensibilities?
- Can you identify moments where base elements in art have served a higher artistic purpose in your experience?
- How might Schiller's distinction between moral and aesthetic judgment change your approach to creating compelling characters?
- What "common" subjects in your field might be elevated through nobler treatment?

## Conclusion
Schiller's essay remains remarkably relevant for contemporary artists and creators. His central insight—that artistic nobility comes from treatment rather than subject matter—offers a liberating perspective for creators working across all mediums. The distinction between "common" and "base" provides a sophisticated framework for making artistic choices, while his analysis of moral versus aesthetic judgment explains why we can be captivated by powerful antiheroes despite their moral failings.

This work is absolutely worth your time if you're serious about understanding the philosophy of art. Its greatest value lies in showing how artistic vision can transform any subject matter, suggesting that the limitations in art are not in what we choose to depict but in how we choose to depict it. For any artist feeling constrained by subject matter, Schiller offers the profound insight that true artistic freedom comes from nobility of vision, not nobility of subject.
