# The Undesirable Truths: How History Is Falsified - The Pasteur Case
**Original Title**: Les Vérités indésirables - Comment on falsifie l'Histoire - Le cas Pasteur
**Author**: Philippe Decourt | **Year**: 1989

## Summary
This explosive historical investigation challenges one of science's most sacred legends: Louis Pasteur's supposed discoveries. Dr. Philippe Decourt, a member of the International Academy of History and Medicine, spent decades examining original scientific documents from the 19th century and discovered that much of what we believe about Pasteur is deliberately falsified history.

Through meticulous examination of original publications, academic records, and contemporary accounts, Decourt reveals that Pasteur systematically appropriated the discoveries of other scientists, particularly his rival Antoine Béchamp. The book exposes how scientific history was rewritten to create a national hero, elevating one man while burying the contributions of others who actually made the breakthroughs attributed to Pasteur.

This book serves as both a historical correction and a cautionary tale about how scientific myths are created and perpetuated, revealing uncomfortable truths about the intersection of science, nationalism, and institutional power.

## Core Insights

### The Myth of the Lone Genius
The book dismantles the popular narrative of Pasteur as a solitary genius who revolutionized microbiology single-handedly. Decourt demonstrates through extensive documentation that most of Pasteur's supposed discoveries were either extensions of existing work or direct appropriations from other researchers. Pasteur benefited from unprecedented state funding, a full team of paid collaborators, and institutional support that his contemporaries lacked, yet he systematically claimed sole credit for collective achievements.

> "The history of Pasteur poses the problem of truth. It can be undesirable. But should it be concealed then? The nobility of History is in not admitting it."
> _Original: « L'histoire de Pasteur pose le problème de la vérité. Elle peut être indésirable. Faut-il alors la dissimuler ? La noblesse de l'Histoire est de ne pas l'admettre. »_

**Quick Take**: Scientific progress is rarely the work of individuals but rather cumulative efforts that are often retrospectively simplified into heroic narratives.

### The Rabies Vaccine Deception
Perhaps the most shocking revelation concerns Pasteur's famous rabies vaccine. Decourt presents evidence that the celebrated cases of Joseph Meister and Jean-Baptiste Jupille—presented as definitive proofs of the vaccine's efficacy—were fundamentally misleading. Jupille's dog wasn't rabid, and Meister's case was scientifically inconclusive. More damningly, superior vaccination methods already existed but were suppressed in favor of Pasteur's less effective approach.

> "The dog that had bitten Jupille was not rabid, and that of Meister probably was not."
> _Original: « Le chien qui avait mordu Jupille n'était pas enragé, et celui de Meister probablement pas. »_

**Quick Take**: Medical breakthroughs should be evaluated on scientific merit rather than institutional authority or national prestige.

### The Erasure of Antoine Béchamp
The book reveals how Antoine Béchamp, Pasteur's contemporary and rival, made fundamental discoveries about microorganisms and disease that were later attributed to Pasteur. Béchamp's theory of "microzymas" (microorganisms as fundamental units of life) and his work on fermentation were systematically downplayed or ignored. This wasn't merely academic rivalry—it was a deliberate rewriting of scientific history to create a French national hero.

> "The discovery of 'living being' ferments that are the basis of his advice? It wasn't him."
> _Original: « La découverte des ferments 'êtres vivants' qui sont à la base de ses conseils ? Ce n'est pas lui. »_

**Quick Take**: Scientific credit often follows institutional power rather than actual discovery, creating distorted historical narratives.

### The Machinery of Historical Falsification
Decourt exposes the systematic methods used to create the Pasteur legend: selective publication of favorable results, suppression of contradictory evidence, posthumous editing of documents, and the creation of an institutional myth-making apparatus that continued long after Pasteur's death. The French scientific establishment actively participated in maintaining this narrative because it served national and institutional interests.

> "We have been the victims of an immense deception. As undesirable as it may be, the truth deserves to be known."
> _Original: « Nous étions victimes d'une immense duperie. Aussi indésirable qu'elle soit, la vérité mérite d'être connue. »_

**Quick Take**: Historical narratives serve present-day interests, and uncomfortable truths are often sacrificed for convenient myths.

### The Scientific Method versus Institutional Authority
The book demonstrates how Pasteur frequently abandoned rigorous scientific methodology in favor of dramatic announcements and institutional backing. His approach prioritized public acclaim and institutional support over careful, reproducible research. This contrasted sharply with more meticulous scientists who followed proper protocols but lacked Pasteur's political savvy.

> "Pasteur always gives himself reason, even when he most manifestly is wrong. Through the certainties he affirms, he impresses."
> _Original: « Pasteur se donne toujours raison, même quand il a le plus manifestement tort. Par les certitudes qu'il affirme, il impressionne. »_

**Quick Take**: Scientific authority and institutional power can outweigh methodological rigor in determining which discoveries achieve recognition.

## Best Quotes

- "The history of medicine was henceforth divided into two great eras: before and after Pasteur. The other scientists passed into the background. Most often, they were ignored."
  _Original: « L'histoire de la médecine fut divisée dorénavant en deux grandes époques : avant et après Pasteur. Les autres savants passaient au second plan. Le plus souvent, d'ailleurs, on les ignorait. »_

- "What I observed from reading the documents stunned me. My astonishment increased further as I gradually studied the other discoveries attributed to Pasteur. The reality was completely different from the legend."
  _Original: « Ce que je constatai à la lecture des documents me stupéfia. Ma stupéfaction augmenta encore quand j'étudiai peu à peu les autres découvertes que l'on attribue à Pasteur. La réalité était tout à fait différente de la légende. »_

- "One cannot discuss their value: they were officially published by the protagonists of the controversies, signed by them. They are found in the great libraries. It suffices to ask for them."
  _Original: « On remarquera que la question de l'authenticité des documents ne se pose pas ici. On ne peut pas en discuter la valeur : ils ont été publiés officiellement par les protagonistes des controverses, signés par eux. On les trouve dans les grandes bibliothèques. Il suffit de les demander. »_

- "Never have scientists of the 19th century, even the greatest, had as many means as him in France. He knew how to obtain them by attributing the merits of others to himself."
  _Original: « Jamais savants du XIXe siècle, même les plus grands, n'ont eu autant de moyens que lui en France. Il savait les obtenir en s'attribuant les mérites des autres. »_

- "I do not believe it is bad or useless to seek the truth and to speak it, even if it would destroy an enormous legend. But we can admit neither the conformism that perpetuates injustice nor the indifference that tolerates it."
  _Original: « Je ne crois pas qu'il soit mauvais ou inutile de chercher la vérité et de la dire, quand même elle détruirait une énorme légende. Mais nous ne pouvons admettre ni le conformisme qui perpétue l'injustice, ni l'indifférence qui la tolère. »_

## Action Items

- **Question Historical Narratives**: Don't accept scientific legends at face value; examine primary sources and context
- **Recognize Scientific Collaboration**: Understand that most breakthroughs result from cumulative efforts rather than individual genius
- **Institutional Awareness**: Be aware of how institutional and national interests can shape scientific narratives
- **Source Verification**: Always consult original documents rather than secondary accounts when investigating scientific history
- **Critical Thinking**: Maintain healthy skepticism about received scientific wisdom, particularly when it serves institutional purposes

## Questions to Consider

- Why do societies need scientific heroes, and what costs come with creating them?
- How does institutional funding and support influence which scientific discoveries receive recognition?
- What responsibility do scientists have to acknowledge their predecessors and collaborators?
- How can we distinguish between legitimate scientific authority and institutional mythology?
- What happens to scientific progress when inconvenient truths are suppressed for national prestige?

## Conclusion

This book is essential reading for anyone interested in how scientific knowledge is constructed and disseminated. Decourt's meticulous research reveals uncomfortable truths about the relationship between science, nationalism, and institutional power. While the book may seem iconoclastic, it ultimately serves a deeper purpose: restoring scientific integrity and historical accuracy.

The biggest reason to read this book is its demonstration that scientific progress depends on truth rather than mythology. By exposing the falsification of Pasteur's legacy, Decourt reminds us that real scientific advancement requires honesty about who actually made discoveries and how they were achieved. This isn't just about correcting historical records—it's about creating a more honest foundation for future scientific inquiry.

The book is worth your time if you're interested in the sociology of science, historical accuracy, or understanding how institutional power shapes knowledge. Its message extends beyond Pasteur to challenge how we think about scientific authority and the creation of cultural myths. In an era of scientific misinformation and institutional distrust, understanding how historical narratives are constructed has never been more relevant.
