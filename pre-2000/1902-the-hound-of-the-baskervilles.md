You'll gain appreciation for how Holmes's methodical mind unravels a complex web of greed, deception, and psychological manipulation disguised as ancient curses.

## Core Insights

### The Supernatural Illusion
What appears to be a family curse proves to be a carefully orchestrated murder plot using phosphorus-painted hounds to create the illusion of supernatural beasts. Stapleton, a distant Baskerville relative with a claim to the estate, exploits the local legend and Sir Charles's weak heart to engineer his death.

> "The more outré and grotesque an incident is the more carefully it deserves to be examined, and the very point which appears to complicate a case is, when duly considered and scientifically handled, the one which is most likely to elucidate it."

**Quick Take**: Extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence - what seems supernatural often has a perfectly rational explanation when examined closely.

### Deception as Investigation Tool
Holmes masterfully conceals his presence on the moor, allowing everyone (including Watson) to believe he's in London. This deception lets him observe suspects naturally and gather unfiltered intelligence about Stapleton's true identity and methods.

> "I deceived everybody, therefore, yourself included, and I came down secretly when I was supposed to be in London."

**Quick Take**: Sometimes the best way to uncover truth is to make others believe you're not looking.

### The Power of Family Secrets
The mystery's core lies in hidden family relationships - Stapleton is actually Rodger Baskerville Jr., using an assumed identity to get close to his relatives while plotting their deaths for inheritance. His wife Beryl is forced to pose as his sister in the elaborate scheme.

**Quick Take**: Family ties can create both the strongest loyalties and the most dangerous betrayals.

### Methodical Observation vs. Superstition
Holmes systematically dismantles the supernatural legend through careful examination of footprints, timelines, and human behavior. He proves that what terrified superstitious locals was simply criminal ingenuity combined with psychological manipulation.

> "I never guess. It is a shocking habit—destructive to the logical faculty."

**Quick Take**: Logical analysis reveals truth where emotion and superstition see only mystery.
