# The Canterville Ghost
**Authors**: Oscar Wilde | **Year**: 1887
**Category**: Fiction & Literature

## Summary

When American diplomat Hiram B. Otis purchases Canterville Chase despite warnings about its famous ghost, he sets in motion a clash between Old World supernatural traditions and New World practical skepticism. The Otis family—comprising the sensible Minister, his health-conscious wife, their son Washington, fifteen-year-old Virginia, and mischievous twin boys—refuses to be intimidated by Sir Simon de Canterville, the 300-year-old specter who has successfully haunted the mansion for centuries. Through a series of hilarious failed attempts at terrorizing, the ghost is systematically defeated by American practicality (chain lubricant, stain remover, and well-aimed pillows), until only young Virginia shows him the kindness and compassion he needs to find peace.

Readers who enjoy clever satire, gentle humor, and stories that turn supernatural tropes upside down will delight in Wilde's subversion of ghost story conventions. The story offers both entertainment and surprising emotional depth through its exploration of redemption, forgiveness, and the universal need for peace.

## Fast-Track Story Guide

### The Essential Plot

The Otis family arrives at Canterville Chase fully aware of its famous ghost but completely unafraid. When Sir Simon makes his dramatic first appearance, complete with clanking chains and terrifying aspect, Mr. Otis calmly offers him lubricant for the noisy chains. This begins a series of failed haunting attempts where each traditional ghostly manifestation is met with practical American solutions: the mysterious bloodstain is cleaned with detergent, phantom attacks are countered with pea-shooters, and terrifying apparitions are dismissed as tricks. The ghost's dignity is systematically destroyed until he becomes a pitiable figure.

The turning point comes when Virginia encounters the ghost in a state of deep depression. Despite knowing he murdered his wife, she shows him compassion, and he explains his three-century torment and inability to sleep or weep for his sins. He reveals that only a "golden girl" who prays for him and weeps for his sins can bring him peace, referencing an ancient prophecy. Virginia courageously accompanies him through a supernatural portal to the Garden of Death, where she intercedes for his soul. She returns with a jewel box and news of his peaceful death, while the almond tree outside miraculously blossoms—fulfilling the prophecy.
