### The Rise and Fall
Pip's mysterious fortune arrives through lawyer Jaggers, who announces he has "great expectations" and must be brought up as a gentleman. Moving to London, Pip becomes snobbish and ashamed of his working-class roots, particularly his beloved Joe. He accumulates massive debts pursuing a luxurious lifestyle while believing Miss Havisham is his benefactor and grooming him to marry Estella. His world shatters when he discovers his fortune comes from Magwitch, the very convict he helped as a child.

**Quick Take**: Social advancement without moral grounding leads to character corruption rather than genuine improvement.

### Redemption Through Humility
The revelation about his benefactor forces Pip to confront his prejudices and moral failures. He risks everything to help Magwitch escape England, learning that true nobility comes from character rather than circumstance. Through illness, financial ruin, and humbling experiences, Pip rediscovers the value of loyalty, gratitude, and authentic relationships. His final reconciliation with Joe represents his complete moral transformation and acceptance of his true identity.

**Quick Take**: True growth requires abandoning our pretensions and embracing our authentic selves.
