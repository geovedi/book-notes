**Quick Take**: True compassion extends beyond humans to all living beings.

### The Devastating Impact of Cruelty
The book unflinchingly depicts how ignorance, selfishness, and cruelty damage animals. From brutal breaking methods to overworking cab horses in harsh conditions, Sewell shows how each act of cruelty creates suffering that scars both body and spirit.
