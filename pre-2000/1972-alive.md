# Alive
**Authors**: Piers Paul Read | **Year**: 1972

## Summary

On October 12, 1972, a Uruguayan Air Force plane carrying 45 passengers—including a rugby team, their friends, and family—crashed high in the Andes Mountains. The Fairchild F-227 slammed into a remote mountain peak at 11,500 feet, leaving survivors trapped in one of Earth's most hostile environments. What followed was an extraordinary 72-day ordeal that tested the absolute limits of human endurance, faith, and moral resolve.

This is not just a survival story—it's a profound exploration of what happens when civilized people are stripped of all modern comforts and forced to confront fundamental questions about life, death, and what it truly means to be human. The sixteen men who endured this ordeal would face avalanches, starvation, frostbite, and ultimately, the most unthinkable moral choice imaginable.

For readers interested in human psychology, extreme survival, and the strength of the human spirit, this book offers unparalleled insight into how ordinary people can achieve the extraordinary when pushed beyond all conceivable limits.

## Core Insights

### The Crash and Immediate Aftermath

The journey began with excitement—a rugby team's chartered flight to Santiago, Chile. But poor weather and pilot error led to disaster when the plane flew directly into an Andean mountain peak. The impact tore off wings and tail, sending the fuselage sliding down a snow-covered valley like a toboggan. Of the 45 passengers, 33 survived the initial crash, but many were severely injured. The medical students among them—Roberto Canessa and Gustavo Zerbino—became instant doctors, performing crude surgery with whatever tools they could find. They set broken legs, treated head wounds, and made impossible decisions about who might live and who was beyond help.

> "There were sixteen survivors. This is the story of what they suffered and of how they remained alive."

**Quick Take**: In moments of crisis, ordinary people can discover extraordinary capabilities they never knew they possessed.

### The Brutal Reality Sets In

Hope turned to despair as days passed with no rescue. The survivors discovered the plane's radio was useless without batteries from the missing tail section. Their meager food supplies—chocolate, wine, and small amounts of jam—ran out quickly. They organized themselves under Marcelo Pérez, the rugby team captain, establishing routines for collecting snow for water, improving their shelter inside the fuselage, and keeping watch for rescue planes. But as days turned into weeks, the reality of their situation became devastatingly clear: they were completely alone, and starving to death was inevitable.

> "For God's sake," said Marcelo, pleading rhetorically with the unknown thief. "Don't you realize that you're playing with our lives?"

**Quick Take**: Survival depends not just on physical resources, but on maintaining hope and social structure even in the face of overwhelming odds.

### The Unthinkable Choice

After weeks of starvation, with rescue efforts having been called off, the survivors faced an agonizing decision. The bodies of their dead friends were preserved in the snow. Could they bring themselves to consume human flesh to survive? This wasn't a sudden decision but a gradual, painful discussion grounded in their Catholic faith and deep respect for the deceased. They drew parallels to Catholic communion and reasoned that their friends would have wanted them to live. The first acts were horrific, but necessity made it bearable. This choice, though morally devastating, ultimately provided the protein and energy needed for the final push toward survival.

**Quick Take**: When pushed to absolute extremes, moral choices become context-dependent—survival sometimes requires actions that would be unthinkable in normal life.

### The Final Expedition

Two months after the crash, with eight more deaths having reduced their numbers to 16, Nando Parrado and Roberto Canessa decided they couldn't wait any longer. Parrado, whose mother and sister had died in the crash, was determined to escape. They prepared for a grueling journey, fashioning a sleeping bag from plane insulation and taking what little food remained. For ten days, they climbed higher peaks than ever before, suffering from altitude sickness and exhaustion. Finally, on day 70, they saw civilization—a group of cattle on a distant Chilean valley floor. Three days later, Parrado and two other survivors encountered a Chilean peasant, who summoned help.

**Quick Take**: The most extraordinary achievements often come when we accept that success requires us to leave our comfort zones and face seemingly impossible challenges.

## Questions to Consider

1. What would you do if faced with the same moral choice as the survivors?
2. How much of our "civilized" behavior depends on comfortable circumstances rather than inherent morality?
3. What role did faith—both religious and in each other—play in their survival?
4. How do societies decide which moral rules are absolute and which can be broken in extreme circumstances?

## Conclusion

This is absolutely worth your time—not as a sensational tale of cannibalism, but as a profound meditation on human nature under extreme pressure. The biggest reason to read "Alive" is to understand that the capacity for heroism, sacrifice, and moral complexity exists within ordinary people. It challenges us to consider what we're truly made of when everything is stripped away.

More than just a survival story, this book reveals how friendship, faith, and the human will to live can triumph even in the most devastating circumstances. It's a testament to the idea that civilization isn't about external conditions, but about how we treat each other even when all pretenses are gone. The survivors emerged not as broken victims, but as young men who had looked into the abyss and found strength they never knew they possessed.
