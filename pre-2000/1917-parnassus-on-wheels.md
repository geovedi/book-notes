## Fast-Track Story Guide

### The Setup
Helen McGill is tired of being the invisible domestic engine behind her brother Andrew's literary success. While he writes flowery prose about farm life, she's the one actually cooking three meals a day, darning socks, and keeping the farm running. When a traveling bookseller arrives in a horse-drawn wagon full of books, Helen sees both a threat and an opportunity.

### The Turning Point
"I'll buy it myself," Helen declares, impulsively spending her Ford savings on Roger Mifflin's traveling bookshop. She leaves a note for her brother announcing her own "revolt of womanhood" and drives off into the October countryside in a blue wagon painted with the words "R. Mifflin's Travelling Parnassus."

### The Journey
Helen's adventure includes learning to drive a horse-drawn van, selling books to skeptical farmers, and encountering colorful characters. More importantly, she discovers Roger Mifflin's passion for literature and his belief that "books are the truest friends of man." When Andrew mistakenly has Roger arrested for fraud, Helen must rescue him, leading to a romantic revelation.

### The Resolution
After freeing Roger from jail, Helen realizes she's found not just independence but love. They marry and continue traveling together in Parnassus, spreading the joy of reading across the countryside. The story ends with them surprising Andrew at the farm, now a happily married couple ready for their next chapter together.
