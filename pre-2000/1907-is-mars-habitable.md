# Is Mars Habitable?
**Authors**: Alfred Russel Wallace | **Year**: 1907

## Summary
This landmark scientific critique dismantles Percival Lowell's controversial theory that Mars is inhabited by intelligent beings who constructed a planet-wide system of irrigation canals. Wallace, co-discoverer of evolution by natural selection, systematically examines the physical conditions on Mars and demonstrates through multiple independent lines of evidence that the planet is absolutely uninhabitable. Written as a response to Lowell's popular works claiming Martian civilization, this book represents one of the earliest examples of scientific skepticism applied to extraterrestrial life claims, using rigorous physics, chemistry, and planetary science to refute what had become public fascination with Martian "canals."

This book will appeal to science enthusiasts, skeptics, and anyone interested in the history of astronomy and the scientific method. Readers will gain insight into how scientific controversy is resolved through evidence-based reasoning, and learn fundamental principles about planetary habitability that remain relevant to modern astrobiology.

## Core Insights

### The Water Problem: Mars Has No Liquid Water
Wallace demonstrates through molecular physics that Mars cannot retain water vapor in its atmosphere. Dr. Johnstone Stoney's calculations show that a planet needs at least one-quarter Earth's mass to permanently retain water vapor, but Mars has only one-ninth Earth's mass. This means any water would escape into space. Wallace also points out the lack of spectroscopic evidence for water vapor despite attempts by multiple observatories, including Lowell's own. The famous "blue color" around melting polar caps that Lowell claims proves water presence is scientifically meaningless—shallow water doesn't appear blue by reflected light, and the effect could easily be caused by dust-laden carbon dioxide gas.

> "This absence of water is of itself conclusive against the existence of animal life, unless we enter the regions of pure conjecture as to the possibility of some other liquid being able to take its place."
**Quick Take**: Without water, complex life is impossible, and physics shows Mars cannot keep water.

### The Temperature Crisis: Mars Is Too Cold for Life
Wallace presents three independent proofs that Mars is far too cold for life. First, Mars's greater distance from the sun would give it a mean temperature of about -35°F even with an Earth-like atmosphere. Second, Mars's atmosphere is only 1/12th as dense as Earth's—equivalent to our atmosphere at about 40,000 feet altitude. Even at Earth's equator, this altitude produces permanent snow cover. Third, the Moon's surface temperature (determined by Langley) drops to -200°F at night, showing what happens with a thin atmosphere. Wallace calculates that Mars must be at least 70-80°F below freezing point—far too cold for liquid water or metabolic processes.

> "What this lowering is can be seen in the universal fact, that even within the tropics perpetual snow covers the higher mountain summits, while on the high plains of the Andes, at 15,000 or 16,000 feet altitude, where there is very little or no snow, travellers are often frozen to death when delayed by storms; yet at this elevation the atmosphere has much more than double the density of that of Mars!"
**Quick Take**: Mars is permanently frozen due to thin atmosphere and distance from the sun.

### The Canal Conundrum: Natural Geological Formation
Wallace offers a compelling natural explanation for the "canals" using the meteoritic hypothesis of planetary formation and known geological processes. He proposes that Mars formed through slow aggregation of meteorites, creating a cold interior with a thin heated outer crust that contracted upon cooling, producing vast straight-line fissures. These cracks would naturally form great circles and radiate from points of weakness (the "oases"). Wallace compares these to terrestrial features like the Cleveland Dyke in England (60 miles of nearly perfect straight line) and Jordan Valley fault (400 miles straight), showing Earth also produces straight geological features despite its complex geology.

> "The hardened and contracting surface being free to move laterally on account of there being a more heated and plastic layer below it, the cracks once initiated above would continually widen at the surface as they penetrated deeper and deeper into the slightly heated substratum."
**Quick Take**: The "canals" are natural cracks from planetary cooling, not artificial construction.

### The Irrigation Impossibility: Physics Defies Martian Engineering
Wallace destroys Lowell's irrigation theory by showing it violates basic physics and engineering principles. He calculates that Mars's polar caps contain at most enough water for one inch over the supposed cultivated areas. The "canals" would waste this precious water through evaporation in the thin, dry atmosphere. More fundamentally, Wallace points out that if Mars's surface were perfectly level (as Lowell claims), water would naturally flow everywhere without artificial channels. If the surface weren't level, straight canals would be useless. Either way, the system makes no sense as irrigation.

> "The mere attempt to use open canals for such a purpose shows complete ignorance and stupidity in these alleged very superior beings; while it is certain that, long before half of them were completed their failure to be of any use would have led any rational beings to cease constructing them."
**Quick Take**: The canal system would be engineering madness even if water existed.

### The Atmospheric Insufficiency: Too Thin for Life
Wallace explains that Mars's extremely thin atmosphere (only 4 inches of mercury pressure compared to Earth's 30 inches) creates multiple barriers to life. This density corresponds to Earth's atmosphere at 40,000 feet—far above the limit of human survival and beyond where complex life exists. The thin air cannot retain heat, cannot provide sufficient oxygen pressure for respiration, cannot support liquid water due to rapid evaporation, and cannot protect against solar radiation. Wallace demonstrates this through terrestrial mountain physiology—every 400 feet of altitude lowers temperature by about 1°F due to atmospheric thinning alone.

> "It is this great principle of the prepotency of radiation over absorption with a diminishing atmosphere that explains the excessively low temperature of the moon's surface, a fact which also serves to indicate a very low temperature for Mars."
**Quick Take**: Mars's atmosphere is too thin to regulate temperature, retain water, or support complex life.

## Best Quotes
- "Mars, therefore, is not only uninhabited by intelligent beings such as Mr. Lowell postulates, but is absolutely UNINHABITABLE."
- "All physicists are agreed that, owing to the distance of Mars from the sun, it would have a mean temperature of about-35° F. even if it had an atmosphere as dense as ours."
- "The very phenomena, which to him seem to demonstrate the intervention of intelligent beings working for the improvement of their own environment, are those which seem to me to bear the unmistakable impress of being due to natural forces."
- "The combination of these two results must bring down the temperature of Mars to a degree wholly incompatible with the existence of animal life."
- "No one can read this book without admiration for the extreme perseverance in long continued and successful observation, the results of which are here recorded; and I myself accept unreservedly the substantial accuracy of the whole series."

## Action Items
- **Apply scientific skepticism**: When encountering extraordinary claims (especially about extraterrestrial life), examine the physical evidence and fundamental constraints first
- **Consider multiple independent lines of evidence**: Wallace builds his case from atmospheric physics, molecular dynamics, temperature calculations, water chemistry, and geology
- **Look for natural explanations**: Before accepting artificial causes for phenomena, examine what natural processes might produce similar effects
- **Question popular narratives**: Lowell's theory captured public imagination despite scientific flaws—remain skeptical of media-friendly scientific claims

## Questions to Consider
- How does Wallace's method of using multiple independent proofs strengthen his argument beyond simple disagreement?
- What role does the history of Martian canal observations play in understanding how scientific errors can propagate?
- How might modern knowledge of planetary formation and atmospheric science refine or confirm Wallace's conclusions?
- What parallels exist between the Mars canal controversy and modern debates about extraterrestrial life evidence?
- Why does Wallace accept Lowell's observational data while rejecting his interpretation, and what does this reveal about the scientific method?

## Conclusion
Wallace's "Is Mars Habitable?" stands as a masterclass in scientific reasoning and a landmark in astrobiology literature. While ultimately proven correct by modern space exploration, the book's value extends beyond its conclusions—it demonstrates how rigorous application of basic physical principles can resolve seemingly complex astronomical questions. Wallace systematically dismantles Lowell's romantic vision of Martian civilization not by attacking observations, but by showing how fundamental physics makes life impossible. The book remains essential reading for understanding both the history of planetary science and the proper application of scientific skepticism to extraordinary claims. It reminds us that the universe operates on knowable principles, and that sometimes the most profound discoveries come not from finding what we hoped for, but from understanding why it cannot be.
