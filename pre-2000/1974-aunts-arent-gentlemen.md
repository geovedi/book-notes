# Aunts Aren't Gentlemen
**Authors**: P.G. Wodehouse | **Year**: 1974
**Category**: Fiction & Literature

## Summary
Bertie Wooster finds himself in typically fine form with pink spots on his chest, leading him to consult the quirky Dr. E. Jimpson Murgatroyd. After being caught in a protest march where his former flame Vanessa Cook is arrested for socking a policeman, Bertie becomes entangled in romantic complications when he learns Vanessa is now involved with his insurance salesman acquaintance Orlo Porter. The plot thickens as Bertie is dispatched to the peaceful village of Maiden Eggesford at Aunt Dahlia's request, where he discovers she has wagered heavily on a horse race and needs his help to sabotage a rival horse.

The story unfolds with classic Wodehouse mayhem involving mistaken identities, the unexpected appearance of Major Plank (who has reasons to dislike Bertie), and various schemes to ensure Aunt Dahlia's horse wins the race. The novel culminates in a dramatic race finish disrupted by a strategically placed cat, after which Bertie and Jeeves wisely retreat to New York to escape the fallout.

**Perfect for**: Wodehouse enthusiasts and readers who appreciate masterful British humor, intricate farcical plots, and the timeless dynamic between the brilliant Jeeves and his well-meaning but bumbling employer Bertie Wooster.

## Core Insights

### The Perils of Aunts with Gambling Habits
Aunt Dahlia's betting addiction becomes the central engine driving Bertie's misadventures. Her willingness to scheme and cheat to win her horse race bets shows how family obligations can lead to moral compromises. Wodehouse uses this to explore the theme that even the most respectable relations can have questionable ethics when money is involved.

> "Do you know what is the trouble with aunts as a class? They are not gentlemen," I said gravely.

**Quick Take**: Family loyalty often conflicts with personal integrity, and sometimes the wisest course is strategic withdrawal.

### Political Protest Meets Romantic Comedy
The novel's opening protest march scene brilliantly combines political satire with romantic entanglement. Vanessa Cook's revolutionary fervor and her propensity for violence (socking policemen) serve as both comic relief and commentary on 1970s political activism, all while complicating Bertie's relationships.

> "She was heading the procession with me and shouting a good deal as always happens on these occasions when the emotions of a generous girl are stirred."

**Quick Take**: Political passion and romantic attachment make for explosive combinations, especially when Bertie Wooster is nearby.

### Rural Peace as an Illusion
Maiden Eggesford appears to be a tranquil village, but Wodehouse masterfully deconstructs this pastoral fantasy, revealing it as hotbed of intrigue, gambling, and sabotage. The contrast between surface serenity and underlying chaos reflects his cynical view of human nature.

> "At first sight Maiden Eggesford had all the indications of being a haven of peace. Then it tore off its whiskers and revealed itself as an inferno."

**Quick Take**: Appearances of tranquility often mask deeper turmoil, especially when aunts and horse racing are involved.

## Conclusion

Is "Aunts Aren't Gentlemen" worth your time? Absolutely. This final completed Jeeves and Wooster novel, published when Wodehouse was 93, demonstrates that the master had lost none of his comedic genius. While perhaps not reaching the absolute heights of earlier classics like "Right Ho, Jeeves" or "The Code of the Woosters," it remains a thoroughly entertaining romp that delivers exactly what fans expect: intricate farce, brilliant dialogue, and the comforting certainty that Jeeves will eventually sort everything out.

The biggest reason to read it is to experience Wodehouse's unparalleled ability to create humor from the most mundane situations, his mastery of language, and the enduring appeal of the Jeeves-Wooster dynamic. In a world that often takes itself too seriously, Wodehouse's light-hearted escape serves as both entertainment and comfort food for the soul. The novel's conclusion—that true peace comes from being three thousand miles away from aunts—might just be the most practical advice ever offered in literature.
