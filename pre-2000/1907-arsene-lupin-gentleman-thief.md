## Core Insights

### The Master of Disguise and Social Engineering
Lupin's greatest weapon isn't lockpicks or explosives, but his complete mastery of identity. He transforms himself seamlessly—chauffeur, opera singer, doctor, Spanish bullfighter—using his deep understanding of human psychology and social dynamics to move undetected through the highest levels of society.

> "Arsène Lupin, the man with a thousand disguises, by turns chauffeur, opera-singer, book-maker, gilded youth, young man, old man, Marseillese bagman, Russian doctor, Spanish bullfighter!"
> _Original: "Arsène Lupin, l'homme aux mille déguisements, tour à tour chauffeur, chanteur d'opéra, bookmaker, jeune homme doré, vieil homme, colporteur marseillais, médecin russe, toréro espagnol!"_

**Quick Take**: True power comes from understanding how people think and exploiting their expectations rather than relying on technical skills alone.

### The Gentleman's Code
Unlike common criminals, Lupin operates by a personal honor code. He targets the wealthy (who he feels can afford it), avoids violence, and sometimes returns stolen items or uses his skills for greater justice. He's more interested in the intellectual challenge than mere material gain.

> "Will return when your things are genuine."
> _Original: "Reviendrai quand tes affaires seront authentiques."_

**Quick Take**: Your principles define you more than your actions—having a code, even when breaking society's rules, creates a distinctive identity.

### The Game of Intellectual Superiority
Lupin's greatest pleasure comes from outwitting his opponents, particularly the brilliant detective Ganimard and even Sherlock Holmes himself. He treats each heist as a sophisticated chess match, often leaving clues and calling cards to taunt those pursuing him.

**Quick Take**: The most satisfying victories come from defeating worthy opponents, not from easy wins.

### Public Perception and Romantic Criminality
Despite being a wanted criminal, Lupin captures the public's imagination with his daring, charm, and flair. People almost root for his success, demonstrating how society sometimes romanticizes those who challenge the system with style and intelligence.

**Quick Take**: How you're perceived matters as much as what you actually do—style and charisma can transform villainy into legend.
