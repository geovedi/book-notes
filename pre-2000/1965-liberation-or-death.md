## Summary

"Liberation or Death" is a collection of revolutionary writings by Camilo Torres Restrepo, a Colombian Catholic priest who became a guerrilla fighter and one of the most influential figures in Latin American liberation theology. The book documents Torres' transformation from academic sociologist to armed revolutionary, presenting his revolutionary platform and strategic messages addressed to various sectors of Colombian society. Written during the height of Colombia's political violence and social inequality, Torres argues that armed revolution is not only justified but obligatory for Christians who seek to effectively love their neighbors and create a just society. The work serves as both a practical guide for revolutionary organizing and a theological justification for liberation struggle, blending Marxist analysis with Christian ethics to create a unique ideology that would influence liberation theology throughout Latin America.

This book is essential for anyone interested in liberation theology, revolutionary movements, or the intersection of faith and social justice. It offers profound insights into how religious conviction can fuel revolutionary action and provides a historical window into the social struggles that shaped modern Latin America.

## Core Insights

### Revolutionary Christianity: Faith as Liberation

Torres presents a revolutionary interpretation of Christianity that argues armed struggle is not only permitted but obligatory for Christians. He grounds this in the fundamental Christian principle of love for neighbor, arguing that when traditional charity fails to address systemic injustice, revolution becomes the only effective way to express Christian love. Torres famously states that when the government is tyrannical and serves only privileged minorities, Christians not only can but must resist it. He abandoned his priestly duties not to reject Christianity, but to embody it more completely by fighting for the material liberation of the oppressed.

> "The Revolution is not only permitted but even obligatory for Christians who see in it the only effective way to realize love for all."
> _Original: "La Rivoluzione non soltanto è consentita ma addirittura obbligatoria per i cristiani che vedono in essa l'unica maniera efficace di realizzare l'amore per tutti."_

**Quick Take**: Torres reframes Christianity from a religion of personal salvation to a force for social transformation, making revolution an expression of faith.

### Class Analysis and Oligarchy's Power

Through his sociological training, Torres provides a sharp analysis of how Colombia's economic elite maintains power through political manipulation, violence, and foreign (particularly American) intervention. He documents how 3.6% of landowners controlled 64% of agricultural land, while 13 million Colombians had only 59% of national income compared to 600,000 wealthy individuals. Torres argues that this structural inequality cannot be reformed through existing political channels because the oligarchy controls all institutions and will never voluntarily cede power.

> "This minority will never make decisions that harm their own interests or foreign interests to which they are tied."
> _Original: "Questa minoranza non prenderà mai decisioni che ledano i suoi propri interessi né gli interessi stranieri ai quali essa è legata."_

**Quick Take**: Systemic inequality requires systemic change - minor reforms within an unjust structure cannot achieve meaningful justice.

### United Front Strategy: Beyond Party Divisions

Torres' most innovative contribution is his strategy for building a "United Front of the People" that transcends traditional political, religious, and ideological divisions. He calls for uniting all those opposed to the oligarchy - Christians and communists, liberals and conservatives, workers and peasants - around a common platform for taking power. This unity is essential because the oligarchy maintains power precisely by keeping the majority divided and fighting among themselves.

> "We must highlight everything that unites us and reject everything that separates us. Let's not waste time discussing whether the soul is immortal when we know that hunger, yes, that is mortal."
> _Original: "Dobbiamo richiamare tutto ciò che ci unisce e respingere tutto ciò che ci separa. Non perdiamo il tempo a discutere se l'anima è immortale quando sappiamo che la fame, questa sì che è mortale."_

**Quick Take**: Revolutionary success requires broad unity across traditional divisions - the enemy is not competing ideologies but the oppressive system.

### The Transition to Armed Struggle

Torres documents his own political evolution from believing in peaceful reform to embracing armed revolution, arguing that this transition was forced by state repression and the failure of legal channels. He explains how the oligarchy's use of violence against peaceful demonstrations proves that power cannot be taken through elections or legal means. Torres emphasizes that armed struggle must be strategically planned, moving from urban organizing to rural guerrilla warfare where the revolutionary forces have advantages.

> "When they make life difficult for us in cities, we must go to the countryside. And from there they cannot throw us into the sea. Then we must resist."
> _Original: "Quando ci rende la vita difficile in città, dobbiamo andare in campagna. E da lì non potremo buttarci a mare. Allora dovremo resistere."_

**Quick Take**: When peaceful protest is met with state violence, armed self-defense and guerrilla warfare become necessary for revolutionary success.

### The Revolutionary Platform: Concrete Alternatives

The book includes Torres' detailed revolutionary platform with specific proposals for land reform (land to those who work it), urban reform (home ownership for tenants), progressive taxation, nationalization of key industries, and free education. These aren't abstract ideals but concrete policies that would redistribute wealth and power to the majority. Torres emphasizes that planning and organization are essential - revolution requires both moral conviction and practical preparation.

> "The property of the land will be of those who work it."
> _Original: "La proprietà della terra sarà di chi la lavora."_

**Quick Take**: Revolution must be accompanied by concrete plans for restructuring society - vague promises are insufficient for transformation.

## Key Actions

- **Build broad coalitions**: Organize across traditional political, religious, and social divisions around concrete shared interests
- **Develop concrete alternatives**: Create detailed plans for restructuring society, not just abstract criticisms
- **Prepare strategically**: Understand that repression will follow peaceful organizing and plan transitions to other forms of struggle
- **Base organizing**: Focus on building grassroots committees and organizations rather than personality-based movements
- **International solidarity**: Recognize that local struggles are connected to global systems of oppression

## Questions to Consider

- When do religious obligations require political action that challenges established authority?
- How can movements maintain unity across ideological differences while pursuing common goals?
- What role does armed struggle play in achieving social justice when peaceful channels fail?
- How can spiritual conviction and revolutionary politics be integrated without compromising either?
- What structural changes are necessary to create genuinely democratic and egalitarian societies?

## Conclusion

"Liberation or Death" is a powerful testament to the fusion of faith and revolutionary politics, demonstrating how Christian theology can provide moral justification for armed struggle against injustice. Torres' writings offer both practical organizing wisdom and profound philosophical insights about the relationship between personal conviction and political action. His analysis of how economic power translates into political control remains relevant today, as does his strategy for building broad-based movements that transcend traditional divisions.

The book is worth reading for its unique synthesis of Christian ethics and Marxist analysis, its practical insights into revolutionary organizing, and its historical importance as a foundational text of liberation theology. Torres' willingness to sacrifice privilege and position for the cause of justice, ultimately dying in combat at age 37, gives his words an authenticity and urgency that transcends their specific historical context. Whether one agrees with his call for armed revolution or not, Torres raises essential questions about the relationship between faith and politics, love and justice, that continue to resonate in struggles for social change today.

His legacy extends far beyond Colombia, influencing liberation theology throughout Latin America and inspiring generations of activists who believe that true religion must be expressed in concrete action for the poor and oppressed. In an era of growing inequality and political disillusionment, Torres' vision of a Christianity that takes the side of the oppressed remains both challenging and inspiring.
