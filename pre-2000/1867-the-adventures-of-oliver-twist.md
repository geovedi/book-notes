## Core Insights

### The Injustice of Social Systems
The Victorian Poor Laws and workhouse system are depicted as fundamentally cruel, designed to punish rather than help the poor. Oliver's famous request "Please, sir, I want some more" is treated as a shocking offense, revealing how institutions dehumanize the needy while maintaining the illusion of moral superiority.

> "Please, sir, I want some more."
> _Original: "Please, sir, I want some more."_

**Quick Take**: Systems meant to help often become vehicles for maintaining power structures and punishing the vulnerable.

### The Power of Innate Goodness
Despite growing up surrounded by cruelty and criminality, Oliver maintains his innate moral character. Dickens suggests that goodness is inherent rather than learned, contrasting Oliver with the criminals who try to corrupt him. Oliver's persistence in virtue ultimately leads to his salvation, while those who embrace cruelty face destruction.

**Quick Take**: Moral character can survive even the most corrupting environments when one maintains personal integrity.

### The Complexity of Criminal Psychology
Fagin and his gang are not simply evil but products of their circumstances. Dickens reveals the social conditions that create crime—poverty, lack of education, and exclusion from mainstream society—while still holding individuals accountable for their choices. Nancy's conflicted nature shows how people can retain humanity even within criminal life.

**Quick Take**: Crime often reflects systemic failures rather than individual depravity, though moral responsibility remains essential.

### The Search for Identity and Belonging
Oliver's quest is not just for survival but for family and identity. His journey from anonymous workhouse orphan to discovering his true heritage reflects the universal human need for connection and purpose. The novel explores how family, both biological and chosen, shapes identity and provides moral foundation.

**Quick Take**: True belonging comes from authentic relationships and understanding one's heritage, not just physical survival.
