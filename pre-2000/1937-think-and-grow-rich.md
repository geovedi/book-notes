# Think and Grow Rich
**Authors**: Napoleon Hill | **Year**: 1937

## Summary
Think and Grow Rich is Napoleon Hill's masterpiece on personal achievement and wealth creation, based on his 20-year study of over 500 successful individuals including Andrew Carnegie, Henry Ford, and Thomas Edison. The book reveals 13 principles that form a "philosophy of achievement" that can be applied by anyone to accumulate riches and achieve success in any endeavor.

The book's central premise is that thoughts become things when mixed with definite purpose, persistence, and burning desire. Hill discovered a "money-making secret" that Carnegie shared with him, which has been used by the wealthiest people in history. This secret isn't directly named but is woven throughout every chapter for readers to discover.

Perfect for entrepreneurs, business professionals, and anyone seeking to overcome limiting beliefs and achieve financial independence, this book provides both the mindset and practical framework for turning ideas into wealth.

## Core Insights

### Definite Desire & Purpose
The foundation of all achievement is a burning desire for something definite. Hill emphasizes that wishing is not enough—you must have an intense, pulsating desire that transcends everything else. Edwin C. Barnes exemplified this when he arrived at Edison's office announcing he had come "to go into business with Edison," not to work for him. This definite purpose, backed by unwavering commitment, ultimately led to him becoming Edison's business partner.

The book outlines six practical steps to transform desire into its financial equivalent: 1) Fix in your mind the exact amount of money desired, 2) Determine what you'll give in return, 3) Establish a definite deadline, 4) Create a plan and begin immediately, 5) Write a clear statement of your goal, and 6) Read it aloud twice daily with feeling and faith.

> "Truly, thoughts are things, and powerful things at that, when they are mixed with definiteness of purpose, persistence, and a burning desire for their translation into riches or other material objects."

**Quick Take**: Success begins with knowing exactly what you want and wanting it intensely enough to take immediate, persistent action.

### Faith & Belief
Faith is the head chemist of the mind that transforms thought impulses into their physical equivalent. Hill explains that faith is a state of mind you can develop through repeated instructions to your subconscious mind through autosuggestion. The story of his deaf son demonstrates how faith combined with desire can overcome seemingly impossible physical limitations.

When you believe you can achieve something, your mind finds ways to make it happen. This principle explains why some people accumulate enormous wealth while others with similar opportunities struggle—wealth begins with a state of mind that expects and believes in abundance.

> "Whatever the mind of man can conceive and believe, it can achieve."

**Quick Take**: Develop unshakeable faith in your ability to achieve your goals by repeatedly feeding your subconscious mind positive affirmations and visualizations.

### Autosuggestion & Self-Programming
Autosuggestion is the medium for influencing the subconscious mind—the bridge between your conscious thoughts and their physical manifestation. Hill teaches that all sense impressions and thoughts reaching the subconscious mind are filed there and become the basis for future thoughts, actions, and circumstances.

By deliberately programming your subconscious with positive, definite thoughts about wealth and success, you create automatic patterns that guide you toward your goals. This is why Hill recommends reading your written statement aloud twice daily with emotion—it's not just repetition, but emotionalized programming that makes the principle work.

**Quick Take**: Program your subconscious mind for success by consistently feeding it positive, emotionally-charged affirmations about your goals and desires.

### Specialized Knowledge vs. General Knowledge
Hill distinguishes between general knowledge (which has little value for wealth accumulation) and specialized knowledge (which can be organized and applied for practical purposes). The key is not knowing everything, but knowing how to organize and apply specific knowledge that serves your definite purpose.

Henry Ford exemplified this principle when he was ridiculed for not knowing specific historical facts. Ford's response was that he could summon experts who knew any information he needed, demonstrating that success comes from knowing how to access and organize knowledge, not from personally possessing it.

**Quick Take**: Focus on acquiring specialized knowledge relevant to your goals and develop the ability to organize and apply it effectively.

### Imagination: The Workshop of the Mind
Imagination is where all plans are created and shaped. Hill categorizes it into two types: synthetic imagination (rearranging existing concepts into new combinations) and creative imagination (receiving hunches and inspiration from infinite intelligence).

The Wright brothers transformed their dream of flight into reality through creative imagination. Edison used both synthetic and creative imagination to invent after thousands of failed attempts. Your imagination is the tool that converts your desires into practical plans and ultimately into physical reality.

> "Man's only limitation, within reason, lies in his development and use of imagination."

**Quick Take**: Cultivate both synthetic and creative imagination to generate new ideas and innovative solutions that others haven't considered.

### Organized Planning & Decision Making
Successful people make decisions quickly and change them slowly, if at all. Unsuccessful people make decisions slowly and change them quickly. This chapter emphasizes the importance of having definite plans backed by practical action steps.

The mastermind principle—coordination of knowledge and effort between two or more people to achieve a specific goal—is introduced as essential for organized planning. No individual has sufficient experience, education, native ability, and knowledge to accumulate great fortunes without the cooperation of others.

**Quick Take**: Create detailed, organized plans and make decisions confidently. Surround yourself with capable people who can help you achieve your objectives.

### Persistence: The Sustained Effort Necessary
Persistence is the sustained effort necessary to induce faith and overcome obstacles. Hill identifies four major causes of failure: lack of definite purpose, insufficient education, lack of self-discipline, and lack of persistence. The story of "Three Feet from Gold" illustrates how most people quit just before success.

Persistence is based on definite causes, including definiteness of purpose, desire, self-reliance, definite plans, accurate knowledge, cooperation, willpower, and habit. Develop persistence by associating with people who encourage you, mastering your thoughts, and never quitting in the face of temporary defeat.

> "Before success comes in any man's life, he is sure to meet with much temporary defeat and, perhaps, some failure."

**Quick Take**: Develop unwavering persistence by cultivating a burning desire for your goal and the habit of continuing despite setbacks and temporary failures.

### The Power of the Mastermind
The Mastermind principle is the coordination of knowledge and effort between two or more people to achieve a specific goal in a spirit of harmony. When two or more minds come together, they create a third mind that provides access to knowledge, experience, and spiritual forces not available to individuals.

Hill describes different types of mastermind groups: those for economic advantage, those for creative problem-solving, and those for mutual education and growth. The mastermind principle amplifies your mental power and provides accountability, diverse perspectives, and collective intelligence.

**Quick Take**: Form alliances with like-minded, ambitious individuals who support your goals and contribute complementary skills and knowledge.

### The Subconscious Mind: Connecting Link
The subconscious mind is the connecting link between the finite mind of humans and Infinite Intelligence. It's the broadcasting and receiving station for thoughts, operating 24/7 to manifest your dominant thoughts and beliefs.

Your subconscious cannot distinguish between constructive and destructive thoughts—it simply works to translate whatever is impressed upon it into physical reality. This is why monitoring and controlling your thoughts is crucial for success. Positive emotions fuel the subconscious effectively, while negative emotions can disrupt its creative power.

**Quick Take**: Carefully guard your dominant thoughts, as your subconscious mind works continuously to manifest them into reality regardless of whether they're positive or negative.

### The Brain & The Sixth Sense
Hill presents the brain as a "vibratory" instrument capable of picking up thought vibrations from other brains. The Sixth Sense represents the creative imagination where hunches, inspiration, and infinite intelligence communicate with you.

This sixth sense develops gradually through application of the other principles. It's what separates ordinary success from extraordinary achievement—accessing knowledge and insight beyond the five senses. When fully developed, the sixth sense provides warning signals, creative ideas, and guidance that seems to come from a higher source.

**Quick Take**: Develop your intuitive abilities by consistently applying all the principles and staying attuned to hunches and inspiration that guide you toward your goals.

### Overcoming the Six Ghosts of Fear
The final chapter identifies six basic fears that prevent people from achieving wealth and success: poverty, criticism, ill health, loss of love, old age, and death. These fears, along with the "seven basic fears" that affect your relationships, can paralyze your progress if not consciously identified and overcome.

Hill provides practical methods for destroying fear through organized thought, faith, and action. Understanding that fears are merely states of mind that you have the power to control is the first step toward mastering them.

> "Indecision is the seedling of fear. Indecision crystallizes into doubt, the two blend and become fear."

**Quick Take**: Identify and consciously work to eliminate fears that hold you back, recognizing that fear is merely a mental state you can control and overcome.
