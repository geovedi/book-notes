# On Killing
**Author**: Dave Grossman | **Year**: 1995

## Summary
"On Killing" is a groundbreaking psychological study that reveals a profound truth about human nature: despite centuries of warfare and violence, humans have an innate resistance to killing their fellow humans. Lieutenant Colonel Dave Grossman demonstrates that throughout history, the vast majority of soldiers (75-85% in WWII) refused to fire their weapons in combat situations, even when their own lives were at risk. This book explores the psychological cost of overcoming this resistance through modern conditioning techniques and examines the resulting trauma that affects soldiers and society.

This essential read provides crucial insights for military professionals, law enforcement officers, psychologists, and anyone seeking to understand the psychological impact of violence in modern society. It offers a unique perspective on combat trauma, the effects of media violence, and the true nature of human aggression.

## Core Insights

### The Universal Resistance to Killing
Research across centuries and cultures reveals that humans have a powerful, innate resistance to killing members of their own species. Studies from WWII showed only 15-25% of soldiers actually fired their weapons at the enemy, a pattern consistent throughout history from ancient battles to modern warfare. This resistance exists even in life-threatening situations where soldiers could justify killing as self-defense.

> "The average human being has a deep, powerful revulsion to killing their fellow human beings."

**Quick Take**: Most people would rather die than kill, making humans fundamentally non-violent by nature.

### Modern Conditioning Techniques
The military developed sophisticated conditioning methods to overcome soldiers' natural resistance to killing. These techniques use repetitive drills, realistic training scenarios, and stimulus-response conditioning to make killing an automatic response. Vietnam-era soldiers showed firing rates of 95% compared to WWII's 25%, demonstrating the effectiveness of this psychological training.

> "Through the media we are also conditioning children to kill; and when they are frightened or angry, the conditioning kicks in."

**Quick Take**: Modern military training can bypass natural resistance to killing, but this creates new psychological problems.

### The Psychological Cost of Killing
When soldiers do kill, they often suffer severe psychological trauma including PTSD, guilt, anxiety, and various psychiatric disorders. The closer the killing method (hand-to-hand vs. long-range), the greater the psychological trauma. This trauma represents the cost of violating a fundamental aspect of human nature.

> "Looking another human being in the eye, making an independent decision to kill him, and watching as he dies due to your action combine to form the single most basic, important, primal, and potentially traumatic occurrence of war."

**Quick Take**: Killing violates our deepest instincts, and the psychological price is paid regardless of justification.

### Distance and Killing
The psychological impact of killing varies dramatically based on distance. Killing at long range (artillery, bombing) has minimal psychological impact, while close-range killing (hand-to-hand combat) causes the most severe trauma. This explains why societies have historically developed increasingly long-range weapons - they reduce the psychological burden on soldiers.

> "The further away you are from your victim, the less trauma you experience."

**Quick Take**: Technology enables killing by creating emotional and physical distance from the act.

### Media Violence and Society
The same conditioning techniques used to train soldiers are present in violent media and video games, creating what Grossman calls an "acquired violence immune deficiency." This exposure weakens society's natural resistance to violence without providing the discipline, context, and support structures that military training includes.

> "We are conditioning children to kill... but without the safeguards."

**Quick Take**: Violent entertainment is accidentally conditioning society for violence while removing natural psychological barriers.

## Best Quotes
- "Despite an unbroken tradition of violence and war, man is not by nature a killer."
- "The link between killing and war is like the link between sex and relationships."
- "When people become angry, or frightened, they stop thinking with their forebrain (the mind of a human being) and start thinking with their midbrain (which is indistinguishable from the mind of an animal)."
- "Every society has a blind spot, an area into which it has great difficulty looking. Today that blind spot is killing."
- "The magnitude of the horror of killing in combat... is the single most basic, important, primal, and potentially traumatic occurrence of war."

## Action Items
- **For Parents**: Monitor and limit children's exposure to violent media and video games
- **For Veterans**: Understand that psychological reactions to killing are normal and seek support
- **For Society**: Recognize that violence in media has real psychological impacts on behavior
- **For Military/Law Enforcement**: Provide proper psychological support for those who have taken life in the line of duty
- **For Everyone**: Understand that the capacity for violence exists in everyone, but so does the resistance to it

## Questions to Consider
1. If humans aren't natural killers, how has war persisted throughout history?
2. What responsibility does society have for veterans who carry the psychological burden of killing?
3. How does modern entertainment's conditioning for violence compare to military training?
4. If killing violates human nature, what does this mean for how we should treat those who kill?
5. How can we maintain the natural resistance to killing while still allowing for legitimate self-defense?

## Conclusion
"On Killing" is essential reading for anyone seeking to understand the true nature of violence and its psychological costs. Grossman's research provides hope - humans are fundamentally peaceful beings who must be psychologically conditioned to overcome their natural resistance to killing. This understanding reframes our approach to military training, law enforcement, media violence, and veteran care. The book's greatest strength is its message that violence is not inevitable or natural, but rather a tragic violation of our basic human nature. This insight offers both a warning about the dangers of conditioning people to kill and hope that peace is our natural state. For military professionals, mental health workers, or concerned citizens, this book provides the foundation for understanding one of the most important but least discussed aspects of human psychology.
