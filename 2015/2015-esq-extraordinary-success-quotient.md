**Authors**: Robin Sacredfire | **Year**: 2015

## Summary
ESQ introduces a revolutionary framework for understanding and predicting success that goes beyond traditional intelligence (IQ) and emotional intelligence (EQ) measurements. The book presents the Extraordinary Success Quotient as a measurable, developable capability that allows individuals to adapt, transfer patterns, and ultimately predict their own future success. Through practical principles and real-world case studies, it demonstrates how ESQ has helped transform struggling students into academic achievers, guide companies to profitability, and provide accurate predictions of life outcomes.

This book is essential for entrepreneurs, business leaders, educators, and anyone seeking to understand the fundamental mechanics of success. Readers will learn how to measure their own success potential, develop the core competencies that predict achievement, and apply practical exercises to increase their ESQ in daily life.

## Core Insights

### Beyond Traditional Intelligence Metrics
The book challenges conventional wisdom about intelligence by drawing a crucial distinction between being "smart" versus being "intelligent." Smart people demonstrate trained reactions within predictable systems—like qualified workers following established protocols—while intelligent people possess the flexible thinking needed to change those systems entirely. This explains why many college graduates find themselves working for less "intelligent" but more successful business owners who can adapt to unpredictable circumstances.

> "A smart person has basically an extensive training on how to do something specific and that's all he ever gained in all his academic years. Very smart people will never understand intelligent people, because they assume that being clever is enough to obtain things."

**Quick Take**: Academic credentials measure obedience to systems, not the ability to transform them. True success requires thinking beyond established frameworks rather than mastering them.

### The Three Core ESQ Principles
Success stems from three measurable competencies that form the foundation of the Extraordinary Success Quotient: the ability to compare and differentiate (analytical thinking), the ability to adapt to different situations with flexible thinking, and the ability to transfer patterns and paradigms to new contexts. Unlike IQ tests that measure cleverness within known domains, ESQ measures adaptability to unknown situations—the key to real-world success.

> "The principles behind the ESQ are responsible for the profit of 70% of the biggest companies in Spain. And, on top of what was already mentioned, this test has successfully reported the success rate of all that have done it, while predicting the future success in life of these same individuals."

**Quick Take**: Success isn't about having the right answers—it's about having the right thinking processes to generate answers in unfamiliar situations.

### Success is Predictable and Measurable
Through analyzing speech patterns, attitudes, and decision-making frameworks, the author demonstrates how success can be predicted with remarkable accuracy. Successful individuals consistently show the same behavioral tendencies—confidence, positive reframing abilities, and faith in the unseen. These attributes, combined with the three ESQ competencies, create a reliable framework for forecasting life outcomes.

> "One of the questions that was often made to me and is related to this issue, regards why I never fail in selecting candidates during a job interview, and can even predict their performance without having to make any interview whatsoever."

**Quick Take**: Your current thinking patterns and behavioral tendencies already contain the blueprint of your future success—making success less about luck and more about self-awareness.

### The Attitude-Intelligence Formula
Success requires a specific combination of psychological attitudes and developmental intelligence. The essential attitudes include confidence and self-esteem, the ability to transform negative perspectives into positive ones, and faith in unseen possibilities. When combined with the three ESQ competencies, these attitudes create an unstoppable momentum toward achievement regardless of starting circumstances.

> "A human being is as dumb as he is frustrated and as intelligent as he is happy. A frustrated doctor is definitely much dumber than a happy rapper."

**Quick Take**: Your emotional state directly impacts your intelligence quotient. Success requires managing your emotional baseline as much as developing your cognitive capabilities.

### Practical ESQ Development Strategies
The book provides concrete exercises for increasing ESQ across different age groups. For adults, recommended activities include traveling alone, learning musical instruments requiring both hands, practicing sports that demand full-body coordination (martial arts, dancing, climbing), and engaging in analytical-emotional combination exercises. For children, simpler activities like organizing music collections, multitasking household chores, and learning to skate develop the same fundamental neural pathways.

> "The secret to Intelligence would make intellectuals feel very small among any other person, as it would give the key for anyone to unlock his own potential and clearly realize the mistakes others do when thinking."

**Quick Take**: Intelligence and success are not fixed traits but developable capacities that grow through intentional cross-hemispheric activities combining logic, emotion, and physical coordination.

## Best Quotes

- "You are smart if you prove to have a quick reaction to certain situations related to governmental needs but you are intelligent if you have the power to change them."

- "Schools are doing the same to children as a dog trainer does to his dogs. Children are being trained to be smart, not intelligent."

## Action Items

- **Take the ESQ Test**: Complete the 30-question assessment in the book to establish your baseline success potential and identify specific areas for development.

- **Practice Cross-Hemispheric Activities**: Engage regularly in activities that require both logical and emotional processing simultaneously—such as learning an instrument, practicing martial arts, or creative problem-solving.

- **Develop Positive Reframing**: Practice transforming negative situations into learning opportunities by asking "What can I learn from this?" rather than focusing on problems.

- **Seek Novel Experiences**: Break routine patterns by traveling to unfamiliar places, trying new activities, and intentionally exposing yourself to situations outside your comfort zone.

- **Combine Analysis with Emotion**: When solving problems, intentionally consider both the logical implications and your emotional responses to generate more comprehensive solutions.

## Questions to Consider

- Are you training to be smart within existing systems, or developing the intelligence to transform those systems?

- How do you currently respond to unexpected challenges—do you adapt, resist, or shut down?

- Which of your daily activities develop flexibility versus reinforcing rigid thinking patterns?

- Are you surrounding yourself with people who criticize you or those who support your growth?

- What would you attempt if you truly believed impossible things were possible?

## Conclusion
This book is worth your time if you're frustrated by traditional intelligence metrics or wondering why some people succeed despite fewer qualifications. The ESQ framework provides a fresh paradigm for understanding success as developable rather than predetermined, with practical applications for career advancement, business growth, and personal transformation. While some concepts may challenge conventional wisdom, the real-world case studies and practical exercises offer immediately applicable strategies for increasing your success potential.

The biggest reason to read this book is its promise that success isn't genetically predetermined or reserved for the traditionally "intelligent"—it's a learnable capacity that anyone can develop through specific practices and mindset shifts. Whether you're seeking career advancement, business growth, or personal transformation, the ESQ framework offers both understanding and actionable pathways to achievement.
