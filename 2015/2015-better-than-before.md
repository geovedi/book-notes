# Better Than Before
**Authors**: Gretchen Rubin | **Year**: 2015

## Summary
"Better Than Before" is a practical guide to understanding and changing our habits—the invisible architecture of daily life. Rubin reveals that we repeat about 45% of our behavior almost daily, making habits the foundation of our existence and future. The book doesn't tell you which habits to form, but rather provides a comprehensive framework for how to change habits based on your unique personality and circumstances.

This book is perfect for anyone who has struggled to form good habits or break bad ones, especially those who feel frustrated by failed attempts at self-improvement. Readers will gain a personalized toolkit of strategies and a deeper understanding of why certain approaches work for them while others don't.

## Core Insights

### The Four Tendencies Framework
Understanding your personality type is crucial for successful habit change. Rubin identifies four distinct tendencies based on how people respond to expectations:

- **Upholders** respond readily to both outer and inner expectations. They wake up thinking "What's on the schedule?" and want to meet all expectations, including their own.
- **Questioners** question all expectations and will meet them only if they believe they're justified. They're motivated by sound reasoning and can resist expert opinion.
- **Obligers** respond readily to outer expectations but struggle with inner expectations. They need external accountability to follow through on personal goals.
- **Rebels** resist all expectations, outer and inner alike. They want to do what they choose to do, often in direct opposition to what others want.

> "Our Tendency colors the way we see the world and therefore has enormous consequences for our habits."

**Quick Take**: Knowing your tendency helps you choose the right strategies. Obligers need accountability partners, Questioners need logical reasons, Upholders need clear rules, and Rebels need to feel they're choosing freely.

### The Foundation Habits
Some habits are more important than others because they strengthen self-control and make all other habits easier to form. The "Big Four" foundation habits are:

1. **Sleep**: Getting adequate rest improves decision-making, mood, and willpower
2. **Exercise**: Regular physical activity boosts energy and reduces stress
3. **Eating and drinking right**: Proper nutrition fuels brain function and impulse control
4. **Uncluttering**: Outer order contributes to inner calm and control

> "Foundation habits tend to reinforce each other—for instance, exercise helps people sleep, and sleep helps people do everything better."

**Quick Take**: Start with foundation habits first. When these are strong, you'll have the energy and self-control to tackle more challenging habits.

### The Strategy of Monitoring
We manage what we monitor. Simply tracking a behavior—whether it's steps walked, books read, or money spent—tends to improve it automatically. Monitoring removes denial and provides immediate feedback.

> "That's why the Strategy of Monitoring works so well: no more fooling ourselves."

**Quick Take**: Track what matters to you. Even simple monitoring (like marking a calendar for daily exercise) creates awareness that naturally leads to improvement.

### The Strategy of Scheduling
If something is on the calendar, it happens. Scheduling transforms abstract intentions into concrete time blocks, protecting important activities from the tyranny of the urgent.

> "If it's on the calendar, it happens."

**Quick Take**: Put your habits on your schedule like appointments. Morning routines are especially powerful because they start the day with accomplishment and momentum.

### The Strategy of Clean Slate
New beginnings provide special power for habit creation. Major life changes—new job, new relationship, new home—create opportunities to establish fresh patterns and routines.

> "Any beginning is a time of special power for habit creation."

**Quick Take**: Use natural clean slates (New Year, new job, new season) or create your own by changing your environment or routine to signal a fresh start.

### The Strategy of Lightning Bolt
Sometimes habits form suddenly through a powerful emotional experience or insight. A single moment of clarity, a shocking diagnosis, or an inspiring encounter can create immediate, lasting change.

> "All I did was read a book, and that action unleashed an enormous force: the Strategy of the Lightning Bolt."

**Quick Take**: Be open to transformational moments, but don't wait for them. Most reliable habit change comes from gradual, consistent application of multiple strategies.

### Identity and Habits
Our habits reflect and reinforce our identity. Changing a habit is much harder if it means losing an aspect of how we see ourselves. The most effective habit change aligns with who we want to become.

> "Our habits reflect our identity."

**Quick Take**: Frame habits as expressions of your desired identity. Instead of "I need to exercise," try "I'm becoming someone who enjoys movement."

## Questions to Consider
- What expectations do you meet easily, and which ones do you resist? What does this reveal about your tendency?
- Which foundation habit would give you the biggest boost in self-control right now?
- What would you monitor if you knew it would automatically improve?
- How could you reframe your desired habits to align with your identity?
- What clean slate opportunities are available to you now?

## Conclusion
"Better Than Before" is worth your time if you've ever been frustrated by failed attempts at habit change. Rubin's framework explains why one-size-fits-all approaches don't work and provides a personalized toolkit for successful change. The book's biggest strength is its emphasis on self-knowledge—understanding your personality and tendencies is the key to choosing the right strategies.

The most valuable insight is that habit formation isn't about willpower or motivation, but about understanding yourself and using the right strategies for your nature. By applying these principles, you can build the invisible architecture of a better daily life—one small habit at a time.
