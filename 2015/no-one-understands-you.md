### How They See You, How They Don’t

Communication is a notoriously challenging endeavour, often leading to misunderstandings. However, gaining a better understanding of how others perceive our words and actions empowers us to shape their perception and control our messages.

While it may seem superficial, how we come across to others is fundamentally significant. In a world where relationships hold great importance and collaboration is critical, little surpasses the importance of effectively conveying our intentions.

The uncomfortable truth is that most of us fail to come across as we intend. We struggle to see ourselves objectively; others are prone to distorting feedback to align with their biases. This can have significant consequences in our personal and professional lives, leading to mistrust, dislike, or even being overlooked entirely. Many have experienced being underestimated or misjudged, causing frustration and injustice.

However, it is crucial to recognise that our perceptions of others are often unfair, biased, incomplete, and inflexible. How we perceive one another is far from rational, influenced by automatic processes prone to error.

Fortunately, social psychologists have dedicated considerable effort to understanding how we see each other. Their research reveals that perceivers are prone to predictable errors governed by identifiable rules and biases. While our intuitions about how others perceive us may be flawed, this collective knowledge provides valuable insights and the opportunity to navigate communication challenges more effectively.

## Why It’s So Hard to Understand Each Other

Regarding communication, it's essential to recognise that we often need to convey more information than we believe we do. We may confidently assert, "He knows what I meant" or "I made myself clear," but the reality is that the intended message is often not fully understood. Despite our assumptions, our facial expressions are not as expressive as we perceive them to be. Even subtle emotions like mild boredom can easily be misconstrued as mild interest or concern, adding to the complexities of effective communication.

We often fall into the trap of two misguided assumptions. Firstly, we assume that others perceive us objectively, seeing us as we are. However, the truth is that each person's perception of us varies and may have different interpretations of our words and actions. Secondly, we tend to believe that others see us the same way we see ourselves, but this is far from the case. Each individual's perspective is influenced by their unique biases, experiences, and interpretations, leading to a divergence of perceptions.

There are two primary reasons why we prove to be challenging to understand. Firstly, nobody is truly an open book. While we may think we are transparent, layers of complexity and hidden depths always make us more enigmatic than we realise. Our true intentions, thoughts, and emotions are not always readily apparent, making it difficult for others to understand who we are.

Secondly, our actions are always open to interpretation. What we say and do can be subject to multiple meanings and nuances. Individuals may derive different variations from the same act or statement, influenced by their perspectives and biases. This inherent subjectivity in interpreting our actions adds another layer of complexity to understanding one another.

In summary, effective communication could be more straightforward. Our messages often fall short of their intended impact, our perceptions of ourselves don't align with how others see us, and our actions are open to diverse interpretations. Recognising these factors allows us to approach communication with humility, openness, and a willingness to bridge the gaps in understanding.

### You Are Surprisingly Hard to Understand

In our daily interactions, we often operate as cognitive misers, conserving mental energy by employing minimal effort to make sense of other people and their actions. To accomplish this, we rely heavily on shortcuts and assumptions that help us navigate the complexities of social interactions more efficiently.

One of the most effective shortcuts we employ is the confirmation bias. This bias leads us to see what we expect to see, filtering information in a way that aligns with our preexisting beliefs and expectations. As a result, we may overlook or discount information that contradicts our established notions, further reinforcing our existing ideas.

The primacy effect adds another layer of complexity to the equation. This psychological phenomenon suggests that our first impression of someone tends to be enduring and significantly impacts how we interpret the following information about that person. The initial encounter sets the tone and shapes our perception, creating a lasting impression that colours our judgments and influences our understanding of their subsequent behaviour. This realisation can bring about a sense of pressure as we become aware of the lasting impact our first impressions can have on others.

It is important to note that individuals do not necessarily employ stereotypes out of malice or bigotry. Stereotypes often emerge because the human brain is wired to use categorisation and generalisations as cognitive shortcuts to understand the world around us, including individuals belonging to specific categories. These stereotypes operate primarily at an unconscious level, exerting their influence without conscious awareness. Consequently, a person may adamantly claim not to stereotype while unknowingly engaging in stereotypical thinking and behaviours.

These cognitive shortcuts and biases shape our perceptions of others and affect how we interpret their words and actions. Understanding these mechanisms can help us approach interactions with greater empathy, awareness, and a willingness to challenge our biases. By recognising the limitations of our cognitive processes, we can strive for more accurate and nuanced understandings of others, fostering deeper connections and more meaningful relationships.

### Your Observers Are Cognitive Misers (and So Are You)

In our day-to-day cognitive functioning, we often adopt a mindset of cognitive efficiency, seeking to conserve mental energy by employing shortcuts and assumptions when making sense of other people and their behaviours.

One of the most influential cognitive shortcuts is confirmation bias. This bias leads individuals to see what they expect to see, filtering information in a way that aligns with their preconceived beliefs and notions. This tendency can limit objectivity and open-mindedness, as people unintentionally seek evidence that confirms their existing viewpoints, disregarding or downplaying contradictory information.

The primacy effect further compounds the challenge of perception. When someone forms their initial impression of you, it tends to be long-lasting and significantly shapes how they interpret everything else about you. The pressure is inadvertently placed upon individuals to make a solid and favourable first impression, knowing that it can have enduring effects on subsequent interactions and judgments.

It is important to note that the use of stereotypes by perceivers does not necessarily stem from malicious intent or bigotry. Instead, it often arises from the innate human tendency to employ categorical information to understand and categorise individuals, including ourselves. Stereotypes operate at an unconscious level and can shape perceptions without perceivers being fully aware of their influence. This means someone may adamantly deny stereotyping while unconsciously engaging in stereotypical thinking and behaviours.

Generally, people tend to assume that others share their opinions and attitudes but not their abilities or moral character. Perceivers often believe themselves to be more talented and less susceptible to corruption than others, inadvertently exhibiting a bias in their perception. It is essential not to take these assumptions personally, as they reflect broader cognitive biases rather than personal judgments.

Understanding these dynamics of perception can help navigate social interactions with a greater sense of empathy and objectivity. By recognising the cognitive shortcuts, biases, and unconscious processes at play, we can strive to cultivate more accurate and nuanced understandings of others while also being mindful of our assumptions and biases.

### The Two Phases of Perceiving People

#### Phase 1 of Perception

Perceivers are naturally inclined to attribute your behaviour to something inherent within you—your personality, abilities, moral character, or individual traits—rather than considering the broader context that may be influencing your actions. This cognitive tendency, known as correspondence bias, plays a significant role in shaping how others perceive and interpret your behaviour.

Individuals often rely on automatic and effortless assumptions when perceiving and evaluating their actions. These mental shortcuts, or heuristics, allow them to quickly make sense of your behaviour without expending excessive cognitive effort. These heuristics can include relying on stereotypes or generalisations based on limited information. Although these shortcuts aid comprehension and decision-making, they can introduce biases into the perception process.

This phenomenon is particularly intriguing because perceivers are typically unaware of the mental shortcuts they employ and the biases they may introduce. From their perspective, they genuinely believe that their perceptions of you are objective and accurate. Their unconscious cognitive processes give them the illusion of perceiving you precisely as you are without recognising the influence of their own biases and assumptions.

This unconscious nature of perception adds a layer of complexity to interpersonal dynamics. Perceivers may firmly believe that their judgments and assessments are based solely on objective observations when in reality, their perceptions are filtered through a lens of unconscious biases and preconceived notions.

The combination of correspondence bias, automatic assumptions, and the unconscious nature of perception can lead to misunderstandings, misinterpretations, and distorted views of individuals. Recognising that others' perceptions of you are not always an accurate reflection of who you are is crucial. Their assessments are influenced by their own biases, limited information, and the cognitive shortcuts they employ.

By understanding these dynamics, you can approach interactions with empathy, recognising that others' perceptions may be flawed or incomplete. Cultivating open-mindedness, engaging in effective communication, and challenging assumptions can help bridge the gap between how you intend to be perceived and how others perceive you.

#### Phase 2 of Perception

Perceivers can adjust their initial impressions of you based on the situational context and other relevant factors. This ongoing evaluation and revision process allows them to refine their understanding of you, resulting in a more accurate overall perception.

When perceivers encounter new information or experiences that challenge their initial impressions, they can incorporate these cues and adjust their perception accordingly. This flexibility allows for a more nuanced understanding of your character, abilities, and intentions. By considering the influence of the situation and external factors, perceivers can refine their judgments and form a more complete picture of who they are.

However, it is essential to recognise that this revision process requires certain conditions to be met. Perceivers must be able to pay attention to the relevant information and be motivated to invest the necessary effort in updating their perceptions. Unfortunately, real-life situations often present challenges to both engagement and motivation.

In our fast-paced and demanding world, individuals are frequently preoccupied with various tasks, responsibilities, and distractions. As a result, they may only sometimes have the mental bandwidth or focus required to evaluate and revise their initial impressions thoroughly. Furthermore, the motivation to invest time and effort in updating perceptions can vary depending on the significance of the relationship or the situation at hand.

Consequently, perception relies heavily on the initial impressions formed during Phase 1 in many everyday scenarios. Due to limited attention and motivation, people often default to their initial conclusions and fail to engage in the deeper analysis needed for accurate perception. This reliance on Phase 1 processes can lead to biases, misjudgments, and incomplete understandings of others.

Understanding these limitations of perception highlights the importance of creating an environment that encourages attentive and motivated perception. Cultivating genuine curiosity, active listening, and open-mindedness can facilitate a more thorough evaluation of others, promoting accurate and nuanced understanding. By actively engaging in the revision process and challenging initial assumptions, perceivers can overcome the pitfalls of relying solely on Phase 1 impressions and foster more accurate perceptions in their interactions with others.

## The Lenses That Shape Perception

### The Trust Lens

When meeting someone for the first time, one of the primary concerns they will instinctively evaluate is whether they can trust you. This initial assessment centres around the fundamental question of whether you are a friend or a foe, someone who can be relied upon or someone to be cautious of.

The decision to trust is primarily made at an unconscious level, based on the signals you project regarding warmth and competence. Warmth is a crucial signal indicating that you possess positive intentions toward the perceiver, while competence signals that you can act upon those intentions effectively.

To convey warmth, it is essential to demonstrate genuine attentiveness. Make intentional eye contact and maintain it, as it communicates engagement and sincerity. A warm smile instantly creates a sense of connection, while nodding to indicate understanding conveys empathy and active listening. When appropriate, displaying genuine concern and compassion further reinforces the perception of warmth. Above all, exhibiting fairness and consistently honouring your word fosters an atmosphere of trust. Additionally, when necessary, being willing to extend trust to others helps put them at ease and encourages reciprocal trust.

Conveying competence is equally essential in establishing trust. Projecting confidence through eye contact and sitting up straight gives a sense of professionalism and capability. It is necessary not to showcase personal vulnerabilities or dwell excessively on shortcomings, as this can undermine the perception of competence. Strive to strike a balance between expressing confidence without veering into arrogance. A touch of modesty can go a long way in impressing others, showcasing humility and authenticity. In moments when you may not feel exceptionally competent, adopting a power pose can help boost your self-assurance and project an image of capability.

Leaders, in particular, must prioritise warmth over competence to inspire trust and loyalty. While competence is undoubtedly important, it is the warmth and genuine care that leaders demonstrate that truly resonate with their followers. Prioritising heat creates an environment where trust can flourish, fostering a sense of belonging, respect, and camaraderie.

By being mindful of the signals you project and intentionally cultivating warmth and competence, you can establish the foundations of trust in your interactions. Whether as a leader or in personal relationships, understanding the power of faith and consciously nurturing it enables deeper connections and enhances the quality of your interactions.

### The Power Lens 

When interacting with individuals who hold relatively more power, it is essential to recognise that their position of authority can influence their perception of you. This shift in perception primarily stems from their heightened focus on achieving their own goals and a reduced interest in understanding the concerns and perspectives of others. Consequently, they tend to rely on cognitive shortcuts and hold less complex, nuanced views of individuals.

It is crucial to understand that power is contextual and dynamic. The power dynamics between individuals can vary depending on the specific situation or point in time. Someone who holds more power than you in one context may have less power in another. This dynamic nature of power means we must adapt our perspective and approach, recognising when power differentials come into play and adjusting our interactions accordingly.

The presence of power often leads perceivers to rely more heavily on stereotypes and preconceived expectations. These cognitive shortcuts enable them to quickly categorise and make sense of others based on limited information. As a result, it can be challenging for you to distinguish yourself as a unique individual in the eyes of high-power perceivers. They may view you through the lens of generalisations and prior assumptions, limiting their ability to perceive your true individuality.

However, it is essential to note that high-power perceivers can exhibit accuracy when necessary to achieve their goals. This highlights the concept of instrumentality—the idea that being someone who can assist influential individuals in accomplishing their objectives can lead them to invest the time and mental energy to see you for who you indeed are. Demonstrating your value and aligning your actions with their goals can increase the likelihood that high-power perceivers will recognise your unique qualities and capabilities.

Navigating power dynamics requires understanding the situational context and awareness of how power differentials can influence perceptions. By recognising the role of power and employing strategies that align with the goals and priorities of high-power individuals, you can enhance their perception of you and foster more meaningful and mutually beneficial relationships.

### The Ego Lens

The ego lens serves a singular purpose—safeguarding and enhancing the perceiver's self-esteem. Thanks to its full functioning, most individuals view themselves as more intelligent, more attractive, and morally superior to the average person. They readily attribute their successes to their capabilities while assigning blame for failures to external circumstances, other individuals, or mere chance. While this self-enhancement bias may not be entirely commendable, it serves its purpose in bolstering their self-perception.

The degree to which your accomplishments and abilities can threaten a perceiver's self-esteem depends on relevance and closeness. Relevance refers to whether the perceiver desires the same achievements and capabilities that you possess. When relevance is low, the perceived threat diminishes, and the perceiver is more likely to see you in a more accurate light. Closeness, on the other hand, pertains to your proximity and involvement in the perceiver's life. When both relevance and similarity are high, you may encounter trouble as the perceiver faces the challenge of mentally diminishing your accomplishments or maintaining greater emotional distance to protect their self-esteem.

These ego lens processes extend beyond individuals to the groups we belong to. A success achieved by someone within our group is perceived as a collective victory, reinforcing our self-esteem. However, success attained by someone from a different group can be seen as a threat to our sense of self-worth.

This underscores the importance of establishing a sense of "us" with the perceiver. When you are part of the same group to which the perceiver belongs, your achievements and abilities can be a source of shared self-esteem for both of you. By fostering a sense of group identity, you can align your accomplishments with the perceiver's sense of pride and create a mutually beneficial dynamic.

Two techniques that can be employed to mitigate potential ego threats are modesty and affirmation. Demonstrating humility in your achievements and abilities can help alleviate any perceived threat to the perceiver's self-esteem. By downplaying your successes and acknowledging the contributions of others, you can maintain a sense of humility and reduce the likelihood of triggering defensiveness or comparison. Additionally, offering affirmations and positive feedback to the perceiver can help reinforce their self-esteem, fostering a supportive and constructive environment that nurtures mutual growth.

Understanding the dynamics of the ego lens and implementing strategies such as modesty and affirmation can help preempt and address potential ego threats in interpersonal interactions. By navigating these dynamics with empathy and sensitivity, you can foster positive relationships and create an environment that encourages mutual respect and growth.

## Lenses for Particular Personalities
### Eager Reward-Seekers and Vigilant Risk-Mitigators

People's motivational orientation can be categorised into two main focuses: promotion-focused and prevention-focused. When individuals adopt a promotion-focused mindset, they aim to achieve a better outcome than their current state. They are willing to take risks, act swiftly, seize opportunities, and generate innovative and creative ideas. However, they may also be more prone to making mistakes, overlooking potential problems, and displaying excessive optimism.

On the other hand, individuals with a prevention-focused mindset seek to maintain their current position and ensure that things run smoothly. They approach tasks cautiously, deliberately, and analytically. They excel in effective planning and being prepared for potential challenges. However, their risk aversion can sometimes hinder their ability to adapt to change, leading to inflexibility and a solid attachment to the status quo.

It is important to note that individuals employ promotion- and prevention-focused strategies depending on the specific context. However, people typically have a dominant focus—a lens through which they view the world and approach their goals.

When communicating with a perceiver, speaking their motivational language effectively is crucial. For a promotion-focused perceiver, frame your ideas regarding potential gains, highlighting how they can end up in a better position than they are currently—appeal to their emotions and optimism, emphasising the positive outcomes and opportunities for growth. Creating a sense of enthusiasm and optimism can be particularly effective in capturing their attention and support.

Conversely, when interacting with a prevention-focused perceiver, avoid losses or mistakes. Present your ideas as ways to stay safe and secure, emphasising the importance of risk mitigation and maintaining stability. Providing concrete, factual evidence and realistic assessments can resonate well with their preference for a cautious and analytical approach.

Understanding and adapting your communication style to align with the motivational focus of the perceiver allows for more effective engagement and persuasion. By tailoring your messages to appeal to their primary lens, you can increase their receptiveness and create a stronger connection that leads to shared understanding and mutual success.

### The Clingy, Anxious Perceiver and the Aloof, Avoidant Perceiver

From early childhood, we form mental models of relationships and develop expectations regarding whether others can be relied upon when we need them. Approximately half of the adults have securely attached models, which are adaptive and allow them to trust easily and form and maintain relationships without difficulty. However, for the other half, navigating relationships can be more challenging.

Anxiously attached adults, as the name suggests, experience high levels of anxiety in their relationships. They strongly desire intimacy while constantly fearing rejection from their partners. This anxiety can manifest in needy, clingy behaviour and emotional volatility. When communicating with an anxiously attached perceiver, it is crucial to be mindful of ambiguity and avoid sending signals that could be interpreted as rejection. Consistency, reliability, and patience are key. It is essential not to take their exaggerated reactions personally, as their insecurities do not reflect you but are a product of their attachment style.

On the other hand, adults with avoidant attachment styles have developed a deep-seated mistrust of others' ability to be there for them. To protect themselves from potential rejection, they intentionally avoid intimacy and connection. They may come across as cold, aloof, and unfriendly. When communicating with someone with an avoidant attachment style, it is essential to remember that their lack of warmth does not necessarily indicate hostility but rather caution. Attempting to warm things up overly may make them uncomfortable. Building relationships with avoidant individuals takes time, as they require a gradual and patient approach. It is essential to adopt a long-term perspective and allow them to develop trust at their own pace.

Understanding the attachment styles of individuals and adapting our communication accordingly can significantly enhance the quality of our interactions. We can foster healthier and more fulfilling connections by providing reassurance, consistency, and understanding to anxiously attached individuals and demonstrating patience and respecting boundaries with avoidant individuals.

## Being Seen, and Seeing Others, More Accurately
### Correcting Bad Impressions and Overcoming Misunderstandings

Human beings have the remarkable capacity to revise their opinions and impressions of others over time. While first impressions carry weight and can shape initial perceptions, it is essential to recognise that there is always time to alter a negative first impression. The crucial factor lies in understanding the underlying processes that drive the perceiver's mind to reassess and reconsider the image initially formed.

To comprehend the mechanisms at play "beneath the hood" of perception, we must acknowledge that first impressions are often influenced by cognitive biases and heuristics—mental shortcuts that help us make rapid judgments. These initial impressions are shaped by limited information, preconceived notions, and personal preferences that can lead to misinterpretations or incomplete understanding of others.

However, these initial impressions can be challenged and revised as individuals engage in deeper interactions and gain more comprehensive insights into someone's character, personality, and actions. This revision is facilitated by various psychological processes, such as cognitive dissonance, where inconsistencies between the initial appearance and subsequent observations motivate individuals to reevaluate their judgments.

Factors that can influence the perceiver's willingness to revise their opinion include the consistency of your behaviour over time, the presence of new information that contradicts their initial impression, and the level of personal relevance and investment in maintaining an accurate understanding of you. Additionally, the perceiver's openness to new perspectives, capacity for empathy, and ability to recognise their own biases and limitations play significant roles in the revision of their opinions.

To effectively address and rectify a negative first impression, it is crucial to approach subsequent interactions with authenticity, consistency, and a genuine willingness to demonstrate your true character. Consistently displaying positive qualities and behaviours contradicting the initial perception can gradually reshape the perceiver's understanding of who you are. Additionally, providing new information or sharing personal experiences that challenge their preconceived notions can aid in shifting their perspective.

It is worth noting that revising opinions takes time and effort. It requires patience, perseverance, and genuine investment to build a more accurate understanding between individuals. While first impressions may have an impact, they are not definitive or irreversible judgments.

By actively engaging in meaningful interactions, displaying positive qualities, and fostering open and honest communication, you can create opportunities for others to reassess their initial impressions and develop a more comprehensive and accurate picture of who you are. Understanding the underlying processes that influence perception allows for greater control over how others perceive and evaluate you, offering the potential to forge more genuine connections and relationships.

### Becoming a Better Judge of Others—and of Yourself

Let's face reality: it wouldn't be fair to complain about others not truly understanding us when we struggle to understand them. There are significant advantages to accurately perceiving others—comprehending their intentions, emotions, and character. However, as perceivers, we are just as susceptible to faulty assumptions, biases, and lenses as everyone else. We share the same cognitive limitations, constrained by limited time and energy, leading us to rely on mental shortcuts unknowingly.

Accurate perception of people, including oneself, is one of our most challenging tasks. People are inherently complex, and their words and actions are often filled with ambiguity and subject to interpretation. We overlook this fact because our brains are wired to make perception effortless and obvious. However, perceiving others accurately is far from effortless, so we frequently need to correct mistakes.

If our goal is to be seen by others as we intend—to have them recognise us for who we are or as we aspire to be—it becomes necessary to lend a helping hand. Blaming the perceiver for misunderstanding us won't be productive. Instead, we can take responsibility for facilitating a clearer understanding of ourselves. This makes it easier for others to perceive us accurately by providing them with the necessary information, context, and cues.

One way to achieve this is through clear and effective communication. Articulating our thoughts, feelings, and intentions explicitly can help bridge the gap between our inner world and how we are perceived externally. Additionally, actively listening to others and seeking to understand their perspectives fosters a mutual exchange of accurate perception. Taking the time to empathise and consider the viewpoints of others can enhance our ability to interpret their words and actions more accurately.

Furthermore, it is essential to cultivate self-awareness. Recognising our biases, assumptions, and limitations allows us to approach perception more objectively. Engaging in self-reflection, seeking feedback from trusted individuals, and being open to self-improvement enable us to align our self-perception with how we want to be perceived by others.

Achieving accurate perception is an ongoing process that requires effort, self-awareness, and open-mindedness. By proactively assisting others in understanding us and continually refining our perception skills, we can foster meaningful connections, reduce misunderstandings, and cultivate genuine understanding between individuals.
