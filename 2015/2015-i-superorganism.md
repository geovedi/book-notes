# I, Superorganism
**Authors**: Jon Turney | **Year**: 2015

## Summary
This groundbreaking book reveals that humans are not solitary organisms but complex superorganisms composed of trillions of microbial cells that work in symbiosis with our own bodies. Turney explains how modern DNA sequencing has unveiled a hidden world of bacteria, viruses, and other microbes that vastly outnumber our human cells—carrying 100 times more genetic material than we possess ourselves. These microbial companions aren't mere hitchhikers; they're essential partners that help digest our food, produce vitamins, regulate our immune systems, and may even influence our brain development and behavior.

The book serves as a fascinating journey into our inner ecosystem, showing how we've evolved alongside our microbial inhabitants and how modern life—with antibiotics, processed foods, and medical interventions—may be disrupting these ancient relationships. For health-conscious readers, science enthusiasts, or anyone curious about what it truly means to be human, this book offers a revolutionary perspective that will change how you see yourself forever.

## Core Insights

### You Are Not Alone: The Superorganism Revolution
The most startling revelation of modern microbiome science is that most of your genes don't belong to you. While human cells contain about 24,000 genes, the microbes living in and on your body contribute around 2 million genes—100 times more genetic material than your own cells. Published estimates suggest we carry between 30 to 400 trillion microbial cells, meaning if cells voted on what happens in your life, the bacteria would probably win. These microbes aren't just passive passengers; they're active participants in nearly every aspect of your biology.

> "Most of your genes do not really belong to you at all."
>
**Quick Take**: Your body is actually a complex ecosystem where human and microbial cells work together as a single superorganism.

### The Gut: Heart of the Superorganism
While microbes inhabit every surface of your body—from skin to mouth to lungs—the gut contains by far the largest and most diverse microbial community. This intestinal microbiome acts as a virtual organ that performs essential functions we can't manage alone: breaking down complex carbohydrates, producing vital vitamins like B and K, regulating metabolism, processing drugs, and even training your immune system. The book reveals how gut bacteria produce compounds like butyrate that nourish colon cells and have anti-inflammatory effects throughout the body.

> "This, if anywhere, is the heart of the superorganism."
>
**Quick Take**: Your gut microbiome functions as an essential organ that influences everything from digestion to immunity to mental health.

### The Immune System: Microbial Manager, Not Warrior
The book challenges the traditional view of immunity as a military defense system constantly waging war on foreign invaders. Instead, Turney presents a revolutionary understanding: our immune system evolved primarily to manage and negotiate with our microbial inhabitants. Rather than seeking to destroy all microbes, a healthy immune system carefully maintains balance with beneficial bacteria while selectively targeting harmful ones. This explains why immune disorders like allergies, autoimmune diseases, and inflammatory conditions have increased as modern lifestyles have disrupted our microbial relationships.

> "Managing this new, carefully maintained consortium that makes up a superorganism turns out to be the reason our immune system evolved in the first place."
>
**Quick Take**: Your immune system's real job is microbial diplomacy, maintaining peace and balance with your internal ecosystem.

### Modern Life: Disrupting Ancient Partnerships
Turney explores how contemporary practices—antibiotics, processed foods, C-section births, reduced breastfeeding, and overly sterile environments—may be damaging our ancestral microbial relationships. Scientists worry we're discovering the importance of our microbiome just as we're systematically dismantling it. This disruption may contribute to rising rates of obesity, autoimmune disorders, allergies, depression, and other modern diseases that were rare in our evolutionary past.

> "Is it possible that we are discovering the really important features of our microbiome at the same time as we are messing it up?"
>
**Quick Take**: Many modern health problems may stem from disrupting our ancient partnerships with microbes.

### The Gut-Brain Connection: Microbes Meet Mind
Perhaps the most mind-bending revelation is how our gut microbes might influence our brain and behavior. The book explores emerging research showing the microbiome can affect mood, stress response, and even conditions like depression and anxiety. Through the vagus nerve, immune signaling, and microbial metabolites that cross the blood-brain barrier, your gut bacteria may be subtly shaping your thoughts, emotions, and mental health.

> "Can these tiniest components of our superorganism influence the seat of reason, the brain?"
>
**Quick Take**: Your mental health may be significantly influenced by the health and composition of your gut microbiome.

## Best Quotes

- "We are covered in life, awash in it, saturated with it, in such variety that it is hard to take in."
- "What's true for E. coli is true for an elephant" — A 1960s molecular genetics slogan that foreshadowed our microbial understanding
- "We are walking, talking bioreactors, wearing thousands of other species, and incubating thousands more in our guts."
- "For once, science really has revealed a new world. This one is in inner space. It is part of us."
- "The flow of new scientific publications about our innumerable microscopic companions is a steady stream now growing towards a flood."

## Action Items

- **Feed Your Microbes**: Eat diverse, fiber-rich plant foods to nourish beneficial gut bacteria that produce anti-inflammatory compounds
- **Limit Antibiotics**: Use antibiotics only when medically necessary, as they can permanently alter your microbial ecosystem
- **Include Fermented Foods**: Regularly consume yogurt, kefir, sauerkraut, kimchi, and other fermented foods to introduce beneficial microbes
- **Avoid Excessive Sterility**: Don't over-sanitize your environment; exposure to diverse microbes helps train your immune system
- **Consider Your Birth Method**: If planning pregnancy, research vaginal seeding and microbiome restoration for C-section births
- **Eat Like Your Ancestors**: Focus on whole, unprocessed foods that supported human-microbe coevolution

## Questions to Consider

- How has learning that you're more microbial than human changed your understanding of yourself?
- What aspects of modern life might be disrupting your relationship with your microbial partners?
- If you could influence your microbiome for better health and wellbeing, what changes would you make?
- How might we balance necessary hygiene with maintaining beneficial microbial exposure?
- What does the superorganism concept mean for concepts of individual identity and autonomy?

## Conclusion
"I, Superorganism" is essential reading for anyone seeking to understand the cutting edge of human biology. Turney masterfully weaves together fascinating science with personal insight, revealing that the most important biological discovery of our time may be that we're not individuals at all, but rather complex ecosystems. The book's greatest strength lies in making complex microbiome science accessible while preserving its revolutionary implications for health, medicine, and our very concept of self.
