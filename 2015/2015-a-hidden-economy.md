# A Hidden Economy
**Authors**: Maria Bargh | **Year**: 2015

## Summary
"A Hidden Economy" reveals the previously undocumented world of Māori participation in the global privatized military industry. Through extensive interviews and research, Bargh uncovers how many Māori, often trained in the New Zealand Defence Force (the country's largest single employer of Māori at 22% of personnel), transition to lucrative careers in private military and security companies (PMSCs). The book challenges conventional definitions of the Māori economy by documenting this significant but invisible economic activity that operates largely outside traditional economic measurements and discussions.

This groundbreaking research provides essential insights for policymakers, academics, and anyone interested in Māori economic development, indigenous studies, or the modern military industry. Readers will gain understanding of how globalization has created new economic opportunities for Māori that exist outside conventional frameworks, and why these "hidden" economies matter for broader discussions about Māori self-determination and economic prosperity.

## Core Insights

### The Hidden Māori Economy
The book's central thesis reveals that significant portions of Māori economic activity remain invisible to traditional economic analysis. While government and academic discussions typically focus on fisheries, agriculture, tourism, and small business, many Māori are earning substantial incomes in the global privatized military sector. With private sector salaries averaging NZ$112,655 compared to a New Zealand Army corporal's $55,023-$63,110, the financial incentives are clear. This hidden economy represents a major gap in our understanding of contemporary Māori economic experiences.

> "The year 2000 was a time when internationally private military and security companies (PMSCs) were flourishing but there was little coverage of them in New Zealand. It was a rapidly expanding industry and Ken Whatuira and his colleagues were entering it, as were many other Māori."
**Quick Take**: Traditional economic indicators completely miss these high-earning Māori professionals, skewing our understanding of Māori economic wellbeing.

### Military Training as Economic Foundation
The New Zealand Defence Force serves as the primary training pipeline for Māori entering the private military industry. With approximately 22% of NZDF personnel being Māori, the military has inadvertently become one of the most significant gateways to high-paying international careers for Māori. This creates a complex dynamic where taxpayer-funded military training ultimately benefits private corporations and individual Māori contractors rather than directly serving New Zealand's defense needs.

**Quick Take**: Military investment in Māori training generates returns that flow to private companies rather than public benefit.

### Global Networks and Māori Identity
The book documents how Māori contractors maintain strong cultural connections while working internationally, often forming informal networks that help others enter the industry. These global Māori networks operate alongside traditional whānau (family) and iwi (tribe) structures, creating new forms of transnational Māori identity. The research shows how Māori cultural values and practices adapt to the unique demands of private military work while maintaining core identity elements.

**Quick Take**: Māori culture proves remarkably adaptable to global contexts, creating new forms of identity that transcend national boundaries.

### Legal and Ethical Complexities
The book explores New Zealand's 2004 Mercenaries Act, which attempts to regulate citizen participation in foreign conflicts while acknowledging the reality of the private military industry. However, as of 2014, no prosecutions had occurred under the act, suggesting it serves more as symbolic legislation than effective regulation. This creates legal ambiguity for Māori contractors operating in this space.

**Quick Take**: Regulation has lagged behind the reality of globalized military service, leaving participants in legally uncertain territory.

### Redefining Māori Economic Success
The book challenges readers to reconsider what constitutes "Māori economic development." Rather than focusing solely on traditional business sectors or collective tribal enterprises, it argues for a more expansive understanding that includes individual success in global industries. This perspective suggests that policy frameworks need to account for diverse Māori economic experiences that don't fit conventional models.

**Quick Take**: Economic success looks different for different Māori, and policy needs to reflect this diversity rather than imposing one-size-fits-all solutions.

## Best Quotes

- "How many of these people go to work for PMSCs? And if we compare the pay, private work clearly has its attractions. In the private sector average annual pay can be around NZ$112,655. A New Zealand Army corporal's annual salary is $55,023 to $63,110."

- "Consider that Māori in this industry are trained originally in the New Zealand military or police force and the New Zealand Army is New Zealand's largest single employer of Māori, with approximately 22 percent of all personnel being Māori."

- "Even if there are few prosecutions the existence of these crimes will act as a deterrent to those New Zealanders who might contemplate becoming a mercenary and also will ensure that mercenaries from other countries do not regard New Zealand as a safe haven."

## Action Items

- **For Researchers**: Look beyond traditional economic sectors when studying Māori economic experiences and consider globalized industries.
- **For Policymakers**: Develop more sophisticated regulatory frameworks that address the reality of private military work rather than ignoring it.
- **For Māori Leaders**: Recognize and support diverse forms of Māori economic success, including individual achievements in global industries.
- **For Military Leaders**: Understand that investment in Māori personnel training creates long-term economic benefits that may flow to private sector.

## Questions to Consider

- How do we measure economic success in indigenous communities when traditional metrics miss major income sources?
- What responsibilities does the New Zealand government have toward Māori who use military training for private gain?
- Should Māori success in global military industries be celebrated as economic achievement or questioned as exploitation?
- How do collective Māori values align with individual profit-seeking in the private military sector?
- What does the existence of this hidden economy reveal about gaps in our understanding of contemporary Māori experiences?

## Conclusion

"A Hidden Economy" is essential reading for anyone interested in contemporary Māori experiences, indigenous economic development, or the globalization of military services. Bargh's groundbreaking research reveals a significant but previously unstudied aspect of Māori economic life that challenges conventional thinking about indigenous prosperity and success. The book's greatest strength lies in its ability to document a hidden world while maintaining sensitivity to the complex ethical and cultural questions it raises.

While the subject matter may seem specialized, the book's implications are broad-ranging, touching on questions of economic measurement, cultural identity, globalization, and the changing nature of military service. It deserves to be read by policymakers, academics, and anyone interested in understanding the full complexity of Māori economic experiences in the 21st century. The book's most valuable contribution is its challenge to think beyond traditional frameworks when considering indigenous success and economic wellbeing.
