**Category**: Business & Finance

## Summary
The Surviving Actor's Manual is a comprehensive business guide for actors that reframes acting not just as an art form but as a serious entrepreneurial venture. Created by actors for actors through the Surviving Actors organization, this practical handbook moves beyond teaching acting craft to focus on the essential business skills needed to create, develop, and sustain a successful acting career in today's competitive industry.

The book's central premise is revolutionary: it's not necessarily the most talented actors who succeed, but those who understand that "show business" is exactly that—a business that requires strategic planning, personal branding, marketing savvy, and financial management. The authors argue that having a business plan prevents acting from becoming "a very expensive hobby" and provides the roadmap needed to navigate the challenging terrain of professional acting.

This guide is essential for actors at all career stages who want to take control of their professional destiny, from drama school graduates wondering how to break into the industry to established performers seeking to build more sustainable, strategically-managed careers.

## Core Insights

### Think Like a Business Owner
The foundational shift that transforms careers: treating your acting as a business rather than just a passion. You have a product (your talent), customers (audiences, casting directors, producers), and you file tax returns as self-employed. This mindset change is crucial because success today goes to the actor with a business plan who understands the industry and knows how to be seen and cast.

> "I can say the biggest mistake is that you have to know first of all it's called show business. It's not called show up, it's not called show off, it's called show business."
> _- Bernard Hiller, LA acting coach_

**Quick Take**: Stop waiting for opportunities to happen to you—start creating them strategically. Your acting career needs the same business planning as any startup.

### Develop Your Personal Brand as Your Greatest Asset
Your personal brand is what sets you apart from seven billion other people on earth. It's not about copying successful actors but discovering your unique combination of skills, appearance, background, and experience that creates your marketable identity. The four-step process is Discover (your story, values, uniqueness), Create (consistent manifestation), Communicate (let people know you exist), and Maintain (update and monitor).

**Quick Take**: Identify what makes you uniquely castable, then ensure all your marketing materials (headshots, website, social media) consistently communicate this brand identity.

### Create a Living Business Plan with SMART Goals
Your business plan is your roadmap from where you are to where you want to be. Start with your "Big Hairy Audacious Goal"—your Mount Everest that drives you when you're doing another shift at your day job. Then break this into SMART goals: Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Realistic, and Time-framed. Your plan is a living document that adjusts to obstacles and opportunities along the way.

**Quick Take**: Instead of vague dreams like "I want to be successful," create concrete goals like "I will film my showreel by September 1st by saving £50 weekly for four weeks and researching three filming companies."

### Build Your Professional Toolbox Strategically
Six essential tools in order of importance: headshots, showreel, business cards, voicereel, website with blog, and contacts database. Quality over quantity—invest in professional materials that accurately represent your brand. Self-taped submissions are becoming increasingly important, with major roles being landed through self-submissions (like Bérénice Marlohe in Skyfall after six years without work).

**Quick Take**: Ensure you can self-tape auditions professionally at home, as this has become a crucial industry skill that creates opportunities regardless of your location or agent representation.

### Network with Purpose and Professionalism
Building relationships is strategic, not just social. When working in theatre, invite industry contacts to shows and follow up with brief "nice to meet you" emails. Connect with theatre departments beyond your own production—press, marketing, literary, development—to maximize opportunities. Focus on building genuine relationships over time rather than mass mail-outs you can't properly follow up.

**Quick Take**: Create a system for tracking contacts and following up meaningfully, focusing on quality relationships over quantity of connections.

### Create Your Own Work to Drive Your Career Forward
Don't wait for casting—create opportunities through fringe productions, short films, web series, or other self-generated projects. With today's accessible technology and resources, actors can produce their own content, build their credits, and create the roles they want to play. This proactive approach demonstrates initiative and builds your professional reputation.

**Quick Take**: Start small with a short film or fringe production, using it to build both creative skills and business relationships that can lead to larger opportunities.
