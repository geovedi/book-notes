# Give Me Money: How I Got Rich and You Can Be Too by Following the Knights Templar Legacy

**Author**: Robin Sacredfire | **Year**: 2015 | **Category**: Spirituality & Religion

## Summary
This controversial book reveals spiritual secrets about wealth accumulation, claiming that organizations like the Illuminati, Freemasons, and Knights Templar possess ancient knowledge about karmic structures and energetic frequencies that control abundance. The author argues that your relationship with money is determined by your emotional baggage from past lives and your current vibrational frequency. The book presents a radical perspective that wealth isn't created through hard work alone but through spiritual alignment, emotional healing, and understanding the hidden metaphysical laws governing prosperity.

This book is for spiritually-minded individuals struggling with finances who are open to metaphysical explanations for wealth disparity. Readers will learn about karmic money patterns, the emotional roots of financial blocks, and how organizations like the Knights Templar used spiritual detachment to become Europe's wealthiest institution while taking vows of poverty.

## Core Insights

### Your Karmic Money Frequency Controls Your Wealth
Your current financial situation reflects your emotional frequency, which is shaped by experiences from this and past lives. The author explains that money flows to those who maintain positive emotional states regardless of external circumstances. Your relationship with money falls into one of eight emotional states: Peace, Joy, Confusion, Anger, Fear, Sadness, Depression, or Apathy. The first two states guarantee money flow, while the others ensure financial struggle.

> "Millionaires lose huge amounts of money all the time but they keep making more. That's the main difference between them and poor people."

**Quick Take**: Stop worrying about money and focus on activities that bring you joy - this shifts your frequency to attract abundance rather than scarcity.

### The Knights Templar Secret: Spiritual Detachment
The Knights Templar took vows of poverty yet became Europe's wealthiest organization because they understood the paradox of abundance: to attract wealth, you must detach from it emotionally. They used their resources to protect ancient wisdom and serve a higher purpose, not personal gain. This spiritual detachment prevented them from falling into the karma of wealth attachment that traps most rich people.

> "With more power, more money and more abundance, also comes more responsibility, more challenges and more problems. They will ruin your spirit if you can't deal with them."

**Quick Take**: Use money as a tool for higher purpose rather than as a source of security or identity - this attracts even more abundance.

### Negative Reactions Create Financial Prison
You're trapped in a "spiritual prison" until you learn to respond positively to all life experiences. Every negative reaction (anger, fear, guilt) keeps you bound to patterns of scarcity. The author reveals that you can only escape this cycle by learning to respond with love and positivity to everything - even betrayals, losses, and attacks from others.

> "You are supposed to learn to live a positive life and release what makes you react and feel negative. Only when you can be 100% free of any reaction, any negative reaction, can you be free from this spiritual prison."

**Quick Take**: Practice emotional mastery by reframing every challenge as an opportunity for growth rather than a threat to your security.

### Your Past Lives Control Your Current Money Blocks
The skills that come naturally to you indicate what you did in past lives. If you struggle with money, you likely have unresolved past-life experiences related to wealth, betrayal, or financial abuse. These patterns repeat until you consciously heal them through love and forgiveness rather than avoidance or hatred.

> "You fear the most what has killed you before; you love the most what has uplifted you before."

**Quick Take**: Instead of avoiding financial situations that trigger fear, learn to love and understand them - this breaks the karmic pattern.

### Guilt Is Your Worst Financial Enemy
The original Aramaic Lord's Prayer focuses on being "delivered from guilt," not evil. Guilt is the primary mechanism that drains wealth from successful people. Family, friends, and society will try to make you feel guilty about having more than others, and accepting this guilt will destroy your financial foundation.

> "Most people will try to make you feel guilty with things that you're not responsible for, and if you accept the feeling, you will lose all your money."

**Quick Take**: Build emotional boundaries against guilt-tripping and learn to say no with love rather than resentment.

## Best Quotes

- "What you have currently is related to your experience with money. Your past experiences give you the reality of money and this includes movies, because they also contribute to form your belief system about what you have around you."

- "You need to know first what you're spiritually destined to be, in order to attract money, and even though you can't see the big picture, the true self is in fact a loving you."

- "People that hold anger within, as well as those that manipulate others to their selfish needs, are more prone to depression, suicidal thoughts, mental diseases, cancer and strokes."

- "The worse enemies of your dreams are your closest friends and relatives. If you want to obtain everything you dream about, you must be willing to lose everything you have now, them included."

- "I don't need to work anymore. What I know has saved me, but sadly I have found that heaven is a very lonely place, because the vast majority of the population lives in hell by choice and don't want to get out of it."

## Action Items

- Identify your current emotional relationship with money using the eight states (Peace, Joy, Confusion, Anger, Fear, Sadness, Depression, Apathy)
- Practice daily activities that bring you genuine joy regardless of financial outcomes
- Learn to detach from money emotionally while still using it as a tool for positive impact
- Build boundaries against guilt-tripping from family and friends
- Reframe every financial setback as an opportunity for spiritual growth rather than a threat

## Questions to Consider

- What emotional state do you typically inhabit when thinking about money?
- Who in your life tries to make you feel guilty about your financial situation or ambitions?
- What activities bring you pure joy that could potentially generate income?
- How can you serve a higher purpose with whatever wealth you currently have?
- Are you willing to lose relationships that don't support your spiritual and financial growth?

## Conclusion
This book offers a provocative blend of spiritual wisdom and practical financial insights that challenges conventional wealth-building advice. While the metaphysical framework involving past lives and secret societies may not resonate with everyone, the core message about emotional mastery and vibrational alignment contains valuable truths about the psychology of wealth. The author's personal transformation from broke to financially free provides credibility to his claims, though some readers may find the emphasis on cutting negative relationships extreme.

The book is worth your time if you're open to spiritual explanations for financial patterns and willing to examine your emotional relationship with money. The biggest reason to read it is to understand how your emotional frequency might be blocking your financial abundance, regardless of how hard you work. However, readers seeking traditional financial advice or business strategies should look elsewhere.
