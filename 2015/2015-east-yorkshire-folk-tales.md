## Core Tales

### The Filey Dragon and Billy Biter
A humorous tale of how the Filey Brig (rock formation) was created when a dragon, hungry from terrorizing locals, gets tricked by the wicked witch Hepzibah. She chases after sticky parkin (Yorkshire gingerbread) that rolls into the dragon's mouth, and when he tries to eat it, his teeth get stuck. The dragon eventually turns to stone, creating the landmark. Meanwhile, the long-suffering tailor Billy Biter finally escapes his abusive witch wife.

> "THAT'S MY EYE YOU'RE POKING YOUR WOOD INTO!" said the dragon. "LET'S HAVE A LOOK AT YOU. I ALWAYS LIKE TO SEE WHAT I'M EATING!"

**Quick Take**: This story explains a natural landmark while showing how cleverness (and sticky parkin) can overcome both supernatural threats and domestic abuse.

### The Witch Hare
A classic shape-shifting witch tale where a local farmer's property is being tormented by a witch who transforms into a hare to steal his milk and butter. Following local wisdom about silver being effective against supernatural evil, the farmer melts a silver coin and molds it into a bullet. When the witch-hare appears, he shoots it, and the hare transforms back into its human form before dying.

> "Courtesy costs nowt!" the old woman shouted after the dismissive farmer - a warning that proves costly when he later discovers she was the witch.

**Quick Take**: Traditional belief in silver's power against evil combines with the perennial theme of disrespecting mysterious elders at your peril.

### The Staithes Mermaids
A bittersweet tale from the coastal village of Staithes about mermaid sisters who fall in love with local fishermen. When their human lovers prove unfaithful, the mermaids take revenge by luring the entire male population of the village into the sea, where they drown. The women of Staithes are left alone, forced to rebuild their community without men.

**Quick Take**: A cautionary tale about fidelity and the consequences of betrayal, blending romance with supernatural retribution.

### Robin Hood Turns Fisherman
The legendary Robin Hood, forced to flee Nottingham, tries to make a new life as a fisherman in Robin Hood's Bay. Despite his famous skills, the local fishermen reject him until he proves his worth by single-handedly defeating a French privateer. The story shows how even legends must prove themselves in new communities.

**Quick Take**: Even heroes face prejudice and must demonstrate value to earn acceptance in unfamiliar territories.

### Caedmon's Miracle
Based on the historical account from Bede's "Ecclesiastical History," this tells of Caedmon, the illiterate cowherd who miraculously receives the gift of poetic song from a divine vision. He becomes the first English religious poet, composing beautiful verses in Anglo-Saxon that Bede himself found difficult to translate into Latin.

**Quick Take**: Divine inspiration can transform the humblest of people into vessels of great art and faith.

## Best Quotes

- "East Yorkshire has borne the brunt of a lot of English history: Anglo-Saxon and Viking invasions, the Harrying of the North, the Pilgrimage of Grace, press gangs, pirates and the Luftwaffe. Its people are tough, unsentimental and independent, its stories downbeat and unromantic, often with a sly, bubble-pricking humour."

- "If Hepzibah can't be bothered to cook, tha'll have to find time to do it thasen," said the farmer. "So think on, lad. Now, the pack's a bit heavy, but still it's lighter than the wheelbarrow, eh?"

- "I reckon Hepzibah married 'im because his cottage is only half a mile from t'pub," they said, shaking their heads.

- "The sea's a wicked chancy old thing even if one's lived by her for a lifetime, as my man found out."
