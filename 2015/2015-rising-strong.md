# Rising Strong
**Author**: Brené Brown | **Year**: 2015

## Summary
Rising Strong provides a research-based framework for how to get back up after failure and disappointment. Brown argues that our ability to reset after falling isn't about avoiding failure, but about developing the courage to reckon with our emotions, rumble with our stories, and revolutionize how we live, love, and lead. The book presents a three-step process—The Reckoning, The Rumble, and The Revolution—that helps transform our most difficult moments into our greatest strengths.

This book is perfect for anyone who has ever struggled with failure, disappointment, or setback and wants practical tools for building resilience. If you're looking to develop emotional courage, better understand your reactions to difficulty, or learn how to turn your struggles into sources of wisdom and strength, this guide will give you actionable frameworks you can apply immediately.

## Core Insights

### The Rising Strong Process: Three Essential Steps
Brown's core framework consists of three critical phases for building resilience. The Reckoning requires us to acknowledge our emotions and get curious about what we're feeling rather than numbing or ignoring them. The Rumble involves honestly examining the stories we tell ourselves about our experiences, challenging our assumptions, and uncovering the truth beneath our narratives. The Revolution integrates what we've learned to create meaningful change in how we live and interact with others.

> "Our power lies in our willingness to own our stories, especially the ones we're afraid to share."

**Quick Take**: Resilience isn't innate—it's a practice you can develop by systematically processing your experiences instead of avoiding them.

### Shitty First Drafts (SFD): The Stories We Make Up
Brown introduces the concept of SFDs—the initial, often inaccurate narratives we create about difficult situations. These drafts typically involve self-protective assumptions about others' intentions and our own worth. The practice involves writing down your first draft, then examining where it might be based on incomplete information or emotional reactions rather than facts.

> "The story I make up in my head is rarely the whole truth."

**Quick Take**: Your first interpretation of events is just that—an interpretation. Question your assumptions before accepting them as reality.

### Living BIG: Setting Boundaries with Compassion
Living BIG stands for Boundaries, Integrity, and Generosity. This framework helps you set healthy boundaries while maintaining compassion for yourself and others. Boundaries protect your energy and values, Integrity ensures your actions align with your beliefs, and Generosity assumes positive intent while holding people accountable.

> "Compassionate people ask for what they need. They say no when they need to, and when they say yes, they mean it. They choose to be true to themselves."

**Quick Take**: Healthy boundaries aren't walls—they're gates that you choose when to open or close based on your values and needs.

### The Physics of Vulnerability: Courage Isn't Comfortable
Brown explains that vulnerability is the path to courage, not weakness. Leaning into discomfort, uncertainty, and emotional risk is essential for growth and connection. The physics of vulnerability states that if we are brave enough, often enough, we will fall— Rising Strong is what happens next.

> "Vulnerability is not winning or losing; it's having the courage to show up and be seen when you have no control over the outcome."

**Quick Take**: True courage requires embracing uncertainty and risk, not avoiding them.

### Emotional Literacy: Naming Your Feelings
Rising Strong requires developing emotional literacy—the ability to identify and name specific emotions rather than just feeling "bad" or "stressed." Brown provides research showing that people who can distinguish between different emotions are better at regulating them and making wise decisions.

> "We cannot selectively numb emotions. When we numb the dark, we numb the light."

**Quick Take**: Specific emotional language is a tool for emotional intelligence and better decision-making.

## Best Quotes
- "The reckoning is where we walk into our story, acknowledging what we're feeling and why.

The revolution is when we integrate our new truth into our lives."
- "Courage is contagious. Every time we choose courage, we make everyone around us a little better and the world a little braver."

- "Our power lies in our willingness to own our stories, especially the ones we're afraid to share."

## Action Items
- **Practice the SFD exercise**: When you experience a difficult emotion, write down your first draft of the story you're telling yourself about what happened, then challenge your assumptions.
- **Start a emotions vocabulary list**: Practice identifying and naming specific emotions beyond basic categories like "sad" or "angry."
- **Set one boundary this week**: Use the Living BIG framework to establish a healthy boundary in your personal or professional life.

## Questions to Consider
- What stories do you repeatedly tell yourself about failure or disappointment that might not be entirely true?
- How might your life change if you viewed vulnerability as courage rather than weakness?
- What emotions do you typically avoid, and what might be behind that avoidance?
- Where in your life are you setting boundaries that are too rigid or too loose?
- What would it look like to integrate your failures and struggles as sources of wisdom rather than shame?
