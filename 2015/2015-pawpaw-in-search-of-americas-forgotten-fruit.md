# Pawpaw: In Search of America's Forgotten Fruit
**Author**: Andrew Moore | **Year**: 2015

## Summary
Pawpaw is the remarkable story of America's largest indigenous fruit - a tropical-tasting treasure that has been hiding in plain sight for centuries. Andrew Moore embarks on a journey to uncover why this delicious, banana-mango flavored fruit vanished from American tables and culture, despite being perfectly adapted to our landscape and climate.

This book is essential reading for food lovers, gardeners, and anyone interested in American cultural history. Readers will discover not just a forgotten fruit, but a deeper understanding of how food shapes identity, how native species get marginalized, and how there's renewed interest in reclaiming local food traditions. You'll learn about the pawpaw's botanical uniqueness, its role in Native American and early American history, and the modern movement to bring it back to popularity.

## Core Insights

### The Botanical Mystery of Pawpaw
The pawpaw (Asimina triloba) is a biological anomaly - the only member of the tropical custard apple family that thrives in temperate North America. It survived ice ages that wiped out its tropical relatives, evolving unique adaptations to survive cold winters while producing tropical-flavored fruit. These small understory trees produce fruit that tastes like a cross between banana and mango, with a custard-like texture that's unlike any other native American fruit.

> "To walk into a wild grove is unlike any other American foraging experience...ripe fruit will fall to the ground and can then be eaten. If unpicked by human hands, ripe fruit will fall to the ground (hence the chorus of the American folk song: 'Picking up pawpaws / Put 'em in a basket / Way down yonder in the pawpaw patch')"

**Quick Take**: Pawpaws represent a living bridge between tropical and temperate ecosystems, offering a taste of the tropics without leaving American soil.

### Deep Cultural Roots
Long before Europeans arrived, pawpaws were vital to Native American foodways throughout their range. Multiple indigenous peoples had distinct names for the fruit, used its bark for rope and string, and incorporated it into medicine. The Cherokee called it "asimin," and many places still bear pawpaw-related names like Alcovy ("pawpaw thicket river") in Georgia and Natchitoches ("the pawpaw eaters") in Louisiana.

> "For an escaped slave, finding a pawpaw patch could have meant the difference between life and death. Guides along the Underground Railroad instructed on not only which routes to take and where to find welcoming homes, but also what wild fruits and berries were safe to eat, and where to find them."

**Quick Take**: Pawpaws were more than food - they were sustenance, medicine, and cultural identity for indigenous peoples and continued to be important survival food for enslaved African Americans and frontier settlers.

### Why Pawpaw Disappeared
The pawpaw's decline wasn't due to poor quality or adaptation, but to cultural and agricultural shifts. As European settlers established permanent agriculture, they prioritized familiar Old World crops over native foods. The rise of commercial agriculture favored fruits that shipped well and lasted long - two areas where pawpaws struggle. Their short shelf life (3-4 days after picking) and fragile texture made them unsuitable for the emerging industrial food system.

> "In the Deep South, pawpaws usually begin to ripen in late July or early August; in the mid-Atlantic and Ohio River Valley, early September; and in the fruit's northernmost range...Each tree produces ripe fruit for about thirty days."

**Quick Take**: The pawpaw's disappearance wasn't natural selection but cultural selection - we chose convenience and familiarity over local adaptation and unique flavor.

### The Modern Pawpaw Renaissance
Today, pawpaws are experiencing a cultural comeback driven by the local food movement, interest in native species, and sustainable agriculture. Pioneers like Neal Peterson have spent decades developing improved cultivars with better flavor, larger size, and more consistent production. Kentucky State University maintains the world's only dedicated pawpaw research program, and festivals celebrating the fruit now occur across the country.

> "With the rise of the local food movement, the awareness of the importance of native plants, the search for a return to authentic, regional cuisines, and the desire for organic, sustainable agriculture, the current cultural climate might finally be the one in which pawpaw breaks through."

**Quick Take**: Pawpaw's resurgence represents a broader shift toward valuing local food systems, preserving biodiversity, and reconnecting with regional food identities.

### Challenges to Commercial Success
Despite growing popularity, significant barriers remain to pawpaw becoming mainstream. The trees take 6-8 years to start producing fruit, wild patches often yield inconsistent harvests due to pollination issues, and most Americans still don't know what they are. Even today, major publications confuse pawpaws with tropical papayas, highlighting how completely this native fruit has been forgotten.

> "The state of Ohio's 2014 official travel guide includes a list of the state's symbols...including Ohio's official state native fruit, the pawpaw...But for the pawpaw, they printed a cut papaya."

**Quick Take**: Bringing back a forgotten food requires not just growing plants but rebuilding cultural knowledge and infrastructure that was lost over generations.

## Best Quotes
- "It is said that no habit gets a stronger hold on a man than the pawpaw habit."
- "Like a gumshoe detective, Andrew Moore tracks down a mystery at once horticultural and culinary: Why is the pawpaw, America's largest indigenous fruit, so little known?"

## Action Items
- Find and try fresh pawpaws during September-October season at farmers markets or foraging (where legal)
- Plant pawpaw trees if you live within their native range (eastern U.S. from Ontario to Florida)
- Support local growers and festivals celebrating regional food traditions
- Learn to identify pawpaw trees and understand their role in local ecosystems
- Experiment with pawpaw recipes - they work well in ice creams, baked goods, and beverages

## Questions to Consider
- What other valuable native species have we lost due to prioritizing commercial agriculture over local adaptation?
- How can we better preserve and revitalize indigenous food knowledge in our modern food system?
- What role do "forgotten" foods play in building more resilient, diverse local food networks?
- How does reconnecting with regional food traditions strengthen community and cultural identity?
- What trade-offs are we making when we choose convenience over uniqueness and local adaptation?

## Conclusion
Pawpaw is far more than just a book about a forgotten fruit - it's a fascinating exploration of American food history, cultural memory, and the complex relationship between people and native species. Moore's journey reveals how food choices reflect broader cultural values and how easily valuable knowledge can be lost in the rush toward "progress."

This book is absolutely worth your time if you're interested in where our food comes from, how native species shape regional identity, or simply want to discover one of America's best-kept culinary secrets. The biggest reason to read it is that it will change how you see the landscape around you - those mysterious patches in the woods may contain treasures you never knew existed.

Pawpaw serves as both a celebration of a unique American fruit and a call to pay attention to what else we might be missing in our own backyards. It reminds us that the most valuable discoveries aren't always across oceans, sometimes they're right here at home, waiting to be remembered.
