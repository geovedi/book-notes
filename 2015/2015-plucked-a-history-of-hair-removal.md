# Plucked: A History of Hair Removal
**Authors**: Rebecca M. Herzig | **Year**: 2015
**Category**: History & Biography

## Summary

This provocative book reveals that hair removal is far more than a personal grooming choice—it's a powerful lens through which to understand America's evolving ideas about civilization, race, gender, and power. Herzig traces how seemingly private decisions about body hair have always reflected broader social anxieties and served as mechanisms for enforcing cultural norms.

From Thomas Jefferson's observations of Native Americans to Guantánamo Bay torture tactics, from Darwin's evolutionary theories to modern laser technology, "Plucked" demonstrates how each generation's "scientific" approaches to hair removal reveal prevailing power structures and cultural fears. The book is essential reading for anyone interested in how bodies become battlegrounds for social control and how personal beauty practices connect to larger political struggles.

## Core Insights

### Hair as Civilization's Marker
Body hair became America's fundamental dividing line between civilized and savage, human and animal. Early European settlers used Native American hair practices as evidence of racial difference, while enslaved people were forcibly shaved as dehumanization. Jefferson noted that Native Americans "pluck the hair as fast as it appears" because "they say it likens them to hogs." This established a lasting pattern: hairlessness as whiteness, hairiness as primitiveness.

> "They say it likens them to hogs. They therefore pluck the hair as fast as it appears." — Thomas Jefferson

**Quick Take**: Your body hair has never been just yours—it's been weaponized to enforce racial hierarchies since America's founding.

### Science as Beauty's Justification
Each era claimed scientific backing for hair removal, revealing how "objective knowledge" serves cultural control. Darwin framed human hairlessness as evolutionary sexual selection: "The females apparently were first denuded of hair in like manner as a sexual ornament." Later, endocrinology pathologized women's body hair as hormonal imbalance, with doctors warning that facial hair suggested a woman might be "queer." X-ray radiation, electrocution, and chemical burning were all marketed as safe, scientific solutions to natural hair growth.

**Quick Take**: "Scientific progress" in beauty has consistently meant new ways to control women's bodies while claiming objective authority.

### Pain as Necessary Suffering
The book's subtitle "Necessary Suffering" captures how pain became normalized in pursuing hairlessness. Working-class women endured radiation burns and disfigurement seeking social mobility through smooth skin. Brazilian waxing normalized genital torture as routine beauty maintenance. This pattern reveals how beauty standards demand physical suffering as proof of feminine virtue and social belonging.

**Quick Take**: Modern beauty practices often mirror historical torture methods, just marketed as self-care choices.

### Corporate Profit from Manufactured Problems
The hair removal industry perfected capitalism's most lucrative model: creating and selling solutions to problems they help invent. Chemical depilatories developed from meat-packing industries were marketed as "civilizing" necessities. Companies pathologized natural body hair to create lifetime customers. From Nair to lasers, the industry profits by making women insecure about their own bodies.

**Quick Take**: The beauty industry doesn't sell products—it sells insecurity about your natural body.

### Political Resistance Through Body Hair
Body hair consistently serves as political rebellion. 1970s "arm-pit feminists" declared "gals say no to nair! we like our armpit hair!" choosing hair growth as feminist resistance. Today's choices about body hair remain political statements, whether embracing natural growth or pursuing smoothness. Personal grooming intersects with larger struggles about bodily autonomy and social control.

**Quick Take**: Your body hair choices are inherently political—they either challenge or reinforce existing power structures.
