### Feeling Gravity
- Gravity and Its Effects:
  - Gravity is one of the fundamental forces governing the universe.
  - Gravity affects everything and is affected by everything, creating a mutual force.
  - Objects heavier than air fall due to gravity.
  - Helium balloons rise in the sky because air below them is denser.
  - Earth's gravity creates a slope, causing objects to fall towards the ground.
  - Objects lighter than air don't fall because they are pushed upwards by denser air.
- Gravity in Space:
  - Without Earth's gravity, there's no notion of up, down, left, or right.
  - Objects fall down slopes created by mass and energy in the fabric of the universe.
  - Earth is a massive ball with things sticking to its surface due to the curved slope it creates.
  - Everything, including light, follows the curves and slopes in spacetime.
- Experiment in Space:
  - Christophe finds themselves in outer space, experiencing weightlessness.
  - They let go of a vase and observe its motion.

  - The bending of spacetime also affects time.
- Spacetime Bending and Celestial Bodies:
  - Earth's gravity bends spacetime, creating an equilibrium with its atmosphere.
  - Moon's bending of spacetime causes tides on Earth.
  - Sun's bending of spacetime affects planets' orbits.

### Cosmology
- Complexity and Uncertainty in Understanding the Universe
  - There are questions about the universe that lack a single clear answer.
  - The universe's overall appearance is not definitively known due to various possible shapes.
  - The composition of the universe remains uncertain, and physics cannot perfectly match reality.
  - Science's limitations stem from the inherent approximations in observations and experiments.
  - Historical instances show discrepancies between scientific predictions and technological capabilities.
- Progression of Science and Nature's Mysteries
  - Science progresses incrementally, often with significant leaps, to better align with reality.
  - Science serves as a scaffold for understanding reality, which is unveiled through experiments.
  - Scientific discoveries about nature are unique to the field of science.
  - Science provides the ability to see what our senses cannot perceive, uncovering the unknown.
- Einstein's Vision and its Impact
  - Einstein's equations aim to simplify complex patterns within the universe.
  - Einstein's equations, when applied to a simplified cosmic model, reveal an expanding universe.
  - Spacetime stretches between galaxies, causing them to move away from each other.
  - The universe's expansion conceptually changes the view of cosmology and our place within it.
- The Birth of Cosmology and the Expanding Universe
  - Einstein's equations allow "rewinding" the universe's expansion, revealing its past contraction.
  - Implementing cosmological principles led to the idea of the universe's beginning.
  - The notion of a universe without initial size, supported by Einstein's equation, emerged.
  - The leading theory to explain the observed universe is the (hot) Big Bang theory.
  - The term "Big Bang" describes the explosive-like expansion from a highly compressed state.
  - Despite its name, the Big Bang wasn't a localized event; it occurred everywhere in spacetime.

### Beyond Our Cosmic Horizon
- Limited View from Earth and the Observable Universe
  - Initial perspective on the beach led to the question of the visible universe's extent.
  - Human eyes capture only a small fraction of the universe's content, primarily within the Milky Way.
  - Telescopes reveal a vastly larger observable universe, defined by the surface of last scattering.
  - The surface of last scattering is both in the past and about 13.8 billion light years away.
- The Significance of the Last-Scattering Surface
  - Light from beyond the surface of last scattering hasn't had enough time to reach us.
  - In the past, the universe was dense, preventing light from traveling freely.
  - The last-scattering surface represents the moment when light began to travel unhindered.
  - This surface serves as a boundary between opaque and transparent spacetime.
- The Concept of Cosmic Horizon
  - The last-scattering surface functions as a cosmic horizon, defining the edge of the visible universe.
  - Earth-centric view limits our perception to the observable universe within our cosmic horizon.
  - Hypothetical scenario of observing the universe from elsewhere questions Earth's centrality.
  - Analogous example of observing the ocean horizon from a drifting raft illustrates the concept.
- Cosmic Horizons Beyond Earth
  - Individuals on distant planets would have their own cosmic horizons centered on their locations.
  - The visible universe beyond Earth would have its unique boundary, the cosmic horizon.
  - Application of cosmological principles ensures similarity in visible universes across locations.
  - Consistency of physical laws and structure results in the expectation of expansion and Big Bang everywhere.
- Multiverse and the Expanding Universe
  - The concept of a multiverse emerges, with separate universes forming a larger whole.
  - Instances of multiverses in the book and their introduction in a progressive manner.
  - The first multiverse instance is widely accepted by scientists.
  - No definitive answer about the entire universe's infinity or finiteness due to limitations in Einstein's equations.
- Evaluating the Big Bang Theory and Supporting Evidence
  - Initial skepticism about the Big Bang theory's credibility.
  - The expansion of the universe's present state doesn't definitively prove the Big Bang.
  - Scientific proof requires empirical evidence beyond theoretical argument.
  - Compelling evidence for the Big Bang theory lies in specific observations from the past.
