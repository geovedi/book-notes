# Learning Phenomenology Fun with Pictures and Text for Adults and Children
**Original Title**: 絵と文で楽しく学ぶ 大人と子どもの現象学 | **Author**: Akihiro Yoshida | **Year**: 2015 | **Category**: Philosophy & Critical Thinking 

## Summary
This innovative book introduces phenomenology—the philosophical study of conscious experience—as an accessible, joyful journey for both children and adults. Through playful illustrations, engaging stories, and thought-provoking questions, the book transforms complex philosophical concepts into digestible wisdom that can be understood by readers of all ages. The author presents phenomenology not as abstract theory, but as a practical tool for understanding how our perspectives shape our reality and how changing our standpoint can transform our experience of the world.

The book is structured around three key chapters: changing perspectives and how it alters what we see, understanding the dynamic between "doing" and "being done to" in human relationships, and exploring imagination through the concept of "doubles" or alternate selves. The author believes that philosophy should be enjoyable and that children and adults can learn together, each bringing unique insights to the exploration of wisdom.

## Core Insights

### Perspective Shapes Reality: The Power of Standing in Different Places
Understanding that where you stand determines what you see is the foundation of phenomenological thinking. The book uses the metaphor of a tunnel where two people agree to meet at "the entrance" but end up at opposite ends because their perspectives differ. This illustrates how the same reality can be experienced completely differently depending on one's position.

> "Things have their appearance when you look at them. Things have their existence when you observe them."
> _Original: 「物事を　見る時常に　立つ場あり　立場を変えれば　見え方も変わる」_

**Quick Take**: Your viewpoint isn't just how you see things—it's what makes those things what they are to you. Changing your physical or mental position literally changes your world.

### The Phenomenon of Hidden Things: Stars in Daylight
The book explores how things can exist even when we can't see them, using the example of stars being present in the blue sky even during daylight. Just because something isn't visible doesn't mean it doesn't exist—whether it's stars in the sky or the feelings in others' hearts.

> "Daytime stars cannot be seen by the eye. Yet they exist, though unseen. There are things that exist even when not visible."
> _Original: 「昼のお星はめにみえぬ。見えぬけれどもあるんだよ、見えぬものでもあるんだよ。」_

**Quick Take**: Reality extends far beyond what you can immediately perceive. True understanding requires looking beyond surface appearances to recognize hidden truths.

### The Mobius Strip of Opposites: Connected Contradictions
Through the famous Mobius strip exercise (where an ant walking on what appears to be a two-sided surface discovers it's actually one continuous surface), the book teaches that apparent opposites—good/bad, beautiful/ugly, truth/falsehood—are often deeply connected. This challenges binary thinking and reveals the complexity of reality.

> "Good and bad, beautiful and ugly, truth and lies, believing and doubting—they're all connected like the Mobius strip. Sometimes things are 'both good and bad' or 'neither good nor bad.'"
> _Original: 「良いことと悪いこと」「美しいものと醜いもの」「本物とニセモノ」「本当とウソ」「信じると疑う」が、つながっている帯ができますね。_

**Quick Take**: Life's contradictions are often illusions of perspective. What seems opposed may be secretly connected in ways that transform your understanding of both.

### The Ghost Chimney: Multiple Truths in One Reality
The book tells a story of four children observing the same chimney from different hotel windows and seeing different numbers of chimneys—one, two, three, or four. None are wrong; they're all seeing from different positions. This teaches that multiple, contradictory perspectives can all be valid simultaneously.

> "From where someone stands determines what they see. The chimney isn't changing—our positions are. All four children were telling their truth."
> _Original: 「その人が立っている場所──立場──から見えるもの」_

**Quick Take**: Truth is often position-dependent. Before arguing about who's right, consider where each person is standing—physically, emotionally, or experientially.

### The "Doing" and "Being Done To" Dynamic
The book explores how changing roles transforms experience through examples like "eating vs. being eaten" or "teaching vs. being taught." When you eat fish, it's delicious; when a shark eats you, it's terrifying. Same act, different perspective. This applies to education, relationships, and power dynamics.

> "In education, teachers help children grow into new worlds, while children help teachers grow into better educators. We help each other grow."
> _Original: 「教育する」ということは、「共に育ちましょう」そして「共に生きましょう」ことなのですね。_

**Quick Take**: Power and experience are relational. Understanding both sides of any interaction creates wisdom and compassion that one-sided perspectives can never achieve.

## Action Items
- Practice perspective-taking: literally move to different positions when observing something and notice how it changes
- Ask "what can't I see right now?" to recognize hidden realities in any situation
- Find connections between apparent opposites in your daily life
- When disagreeing with someone, first understand their position before defending yours
- Practice both roles in relationships—give and receive, teach and learn, lead and follow

## Questions to Consider
- What exists in your world that you cannot currently see?
- How would your biggest problem look from a completely different position?
- What opposites in your life might actually be connected?
- Where are you the "eater" and where are you the "eaten" in your relationships?
- If children are "parents to adults," what wisdom can you learn from young people?

## Conclusion
This book is worth your time because it makes profound philosophical wisdom accessible without dumbing it down. The biggest reason to read it is that it provides practical tools for breaking out of rigid thinking patterns and seeing the world—and yourself—in new ways. By treating children as philosophical partners and using playful illustrations and stories, the author demonstrates the very phenomenological principles he teaches. The book doesn't just explain phenomenology; it embodies it, allowing readers to experience perspective-shifting insights rather than just understanding them intellectually. In a world of increasing polarization and black-and-white thinking, this gentle, imaginative approach to wisdom feels both revolutionary and necessary.
