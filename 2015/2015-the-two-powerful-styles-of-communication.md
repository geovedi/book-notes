# The Two Powerful Styles of Communication
**Authors**: Aiden Sisko | **Year**: 2015

## Summary
This book reveals two fundamental communication styles—Direct and Indirect—that determine your effectiveness as a communicator, leader, and persuader. The key premise is that choosing the wrong style at the wrong time can permanently damage your credibility and relationships, while mastering both styles allows you to perfectly calibrate your approach for maximum influence.

The book is especially crucial for anyone entering new organizations where the balance between strength and approachability determines whether you'll gain a solid foothold or be permanently rejected. Beyond techniques and tactics, understanding when and how to shift between these two predominant modes of communication helps you hit the "sweet spot" for relationship effectiveness and compliance.

**Who this is for**: Professionals entering new roles, leaders seeking to improve their influence, anyone who has struggled with being either too aggressive or too passive in their communication, and those who want to build credibility and power within organizations strategically.

**What you'll gain**: The ability to assess situations accurately and choose the appropriate communication style, understand gender differences in communication, build credibility from scratch, navigate organizational politics, and develop the flexibility to shift between authoritative and collaborative approaches as needed.

## Core Insights

### The Two Communication Styles: Direct vs. Indirect

**Direct Style Communication** is powerful, deliberate, and authoritatively signals expertise and confidence. This is how high-status individuals naturally speak—they command respect, don't ask (they tell), spend more time instructing than listening, and maintain full control of conversations. This style sub-communicates confidence, expertise, high status, and authority, which inspires instant compliance from others.

**Indirect Style Communication** is warmer, less forceful, and focuses on crowd-sourcing input and ideas. Like an orchestra conductor, you tap into the resources around you by asking questions, encouraging participation, and creating safe environments for sharing. The goal is to make others open up and contribute, especially quieter participants who might have valuable insights but lack confidence.

> "People are too hung up on techniques and tactics without realizing there are actually 2 predominant modes or styles of communication one could shift into, to hit the `sweet spot' and maximize communication and relationship effectiveness."

**Quick Take**: No single style is superior—effectiveness comes from matching the right style to each situation and personality type.

### The Newbie Strategy: Start Indirect, Build Power

When entering any new organization, begin with thorough reconnaissance: identify key players, power structures, existing alliances, political climate, and unclaimed "pockets of power" you can claim without stepping on toes. Start with indirect communication to avoid accidentally offending people before you've established your position and gathered strength.

The safest approach is working "from the edge inward"—begin more rapport-seeking and gradually strengthen your position as you gain credibility and understand the landscape. This prevents you from becoming a target before you've had time to build alliances and demonstrate your value.

> "Being in a new environment or organization, never assume things are exactly going to be the same from where you came from! That also includes if you've recently transferred from a competitor within the same industry."

**Quick Take**: Start weak and progressively strengthen your position rather than coming in too strong and making enemies before you understand the terrain.

### Building Strategic Expertise Power

Expertise power can sometimes surpass formal authority power. Instead of trying to be a "know-it-all" (which everyone hates), concentrate on becoming an expert in specific, strategic niches first, then carefully expand outward. This approach is more effective than blasting your power in every direction and spreading yourself too thin.

Look for unclaimed pockets of power—areas where no one has established expertise yet. For example, if you're the first Facebook marketing expert they've encountered, you instantly hold unique specialist power in that domain. From this niche expertise, you can strategically expand into other areas as you build credibility.

> "There are discovered and undiscovered pockets of power that were not previously claimed, that you can easily claim without stepping on anyone's toes."

**Quick Take**: Become the go-to expert in a specific, valuable niche, then leverage that credibility to expand your influence gradually.

### Gender Communication Differences

Men and women are fundamentally wired differently in their communication approaches. Women are 30% more perceptive of emotions through mirror neurons, making them more receptive to nonverbal communication and attuned to emotional nuances. This evolutionary adaptation stems from their role as caregivers who needed to sense their babies' needs.

Men are geared toward logic, competition, and power—their nature as providers, protectors, and hunters. They tend to turn innocent things into competitions and view interactions as challenges and conquests. Women value self-expression more highly and take direct communication more personally, while men are more egotistical and see things as challenges to overcome.

> "In Evolutionary psychology, they were bred into to take care of their off-springs, to know if they need feeding, are in pain, etc. the only way to do this is to be extra sharp in sensing the baby's energy and body language."

**Quick Take**: Recognize these biological differences and adjust your communication style accordingly—women need more emotional consideration, while men respond to competitive framing and logical arguments.

### The Power of Sub-Communication

How you say something matters more than what you say—93% of human communication is nonverbal. Direct communication requires confident body language: minimize fidgeting, use forceful gestures that make points, and maintain strong eye contact. Weak communication is characterized by unnecessary arm movements and deferred body language.

You can hint at authority without explicitly bragging by referencing past experiences ("I faced this problem before and solved it by doing XYZ"), mentioning resources you control, or sharing stories of previous leadership roles. Power often exists in the mind—if you act as if you have it, you manifest and magnify whatever official authority you already possess.

> "And if given a choice between what people say and how they sub communicate things? Most people would put more credence on the non-verbals."

**Quick Take**: Your nonverbal signals either reinforce or undermine your verbal message—ensure they align with your intended communication style.

### Transitioning Between Styles

Shifting from Direct to Indirect requires deliberately stepping back, making room for others to contribute, and resisting the urge to dominate conversations. Instead of jumping in during pauses, comment on what others said, praise their input, or prepare follow-up questions to encourage deeper sharing.

Moving from Indirect to Direct is more challenging—it requires building confidence through preparation, rallying support beforehand, and developing comfort with disagreement when necessary. Being the most knowledgeable person in the room naturally commands authority, as superior knowledge combined with confident delivery makes your statements more compelling and believable.

> "Unfortunately this is going to be harder than someone having immense strength and merely dialing it down."

**Quick Take**: Powering up requires confidence and preparation; powering down requires humility and restraint—both skills must be practiced deliberately.

## Best Quotes

- "Not all positions of power are created equal. Some pockets or positions are easier to marshal than others, while others are just impossible! Identify the low hanging fruits and go after them first!"

- "Power doesn't just come from official titles. It can also come from your abilities and command of the situation. It can come from your vision and skills."

- "If you're the new guy, and you don't know or have not gained a solid foothold in that organization yet? It's always safer to be more rapport seeking and relegate more power to others."

- "In any organization regardless of how big or tiny it may be, involves players politicking constantly. Some prefer to side with expertise power over formal power over social alliances and other negotiation and politicking tactics."
