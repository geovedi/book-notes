# Beowulf
**Original Title**: Beowulf | **Authors**: Anonymous (Beowulf Poet) | **Year**: c. 700–c. 1000

## Summary
Beowulf is the oldest surviving long poem in Old English and the cornerstone of Anglo-Saxon literature. This epic tells the story of its titular hero, a mighty Geatish warrior who travels to Denmark to help King Hrothgar defeat the monster Grendel, which has been terrorizing the great mead hall Heorot for twelve years. After brutally killing Grendel in hand-to-hand combat, Beowulf faces an even greater challenge when Grendel's vengeful mother attacks the hall. Following her defeat in her underwater lair, Beowulf returns home to Geatland where he eventually becomes king. Fifty years later, he must face his final battle against a treasure-guarding dragon, a confrontation that proves fatal but cements his legacy as the ultimate heroic warrior.

This masterpiece is essential for anyone interested in the foundations of English literature, warrior culture, or the transition from paganism to Christianity in early medieval Europe. Readers will gain insight into the values that shaped Anglo-Saxon society—loyalty, courage, honor, and the inevitable confrontation with fate.

## The Epic Journey

### Part 1: The Danish Crisis
The poem opens with the legendary Danish king Scyld Scefing, establishing a theme of heroic kingship. We then meet Hrothgar, Scyld's descendant, who has built the magnificent mead hall Heorot—a symbol of community and civilization. However, this achievement attracts the wrath of Grendel, a monstrous descendant of Cain, who wages a twelve-year campaign of terror against Hrothgar's warriors. The despair grows so great that word spreads across the seas to Geatland, reaching the ears of the young warrior Beowulf.

> "Hwæt! wē Gār-Dena in geār-dagum, þēod-cyninga þrym gefrūnon, hū þā æðelingas ellen fremedon!"
> _Original: "Listen! We have heard of the glory of the Spear-Danes in days of old, of the kings who ruled them!"_

### Part 2: Beowulf's Arrival and First Battle
Beowulf sails to Denmark with fourteen chosen warriors, boasting of his strength and vowing to face Grendel unarmed—man against monster. The tense scene in Heorot builds as the Danes watch while Beowulf waits for Grendel's arrival. When Grendel finally attacks, Beowulf grips the monster with such supernatural strength that he rips Grendel's arm from its socket. The wounded monster flees to die in his lair, and his arm is hung as a trophy in Heorot.

**Quick Take**: True strength isn't just physical power—it's the courage to face your fears and protect others when no one else will.

### Part 3: The Mother's Revenge
Grendel's mother, seeking vengeance for her son's death, attacks Heorot and kills Hrothgar's most trusted advisor. Beowulf follows her to her underwater lair—a terrifying place where normal weapons fail. After a desperate struggle, he discovers an ancient giant's sword in her treasure hoard and slays her, returning with the magic sword's hilt and Grendel's severed head as proof of his victory.

### Part 4: Return and Kingship
Hrothgar rewards Beowulf with treasure and wisdom, warning him about the dangers of pride and the transience of earthly glory. Beowulf returns home to Geatland where King Hygelac and his people welcome him as a hero. Eventually, after Hygelac's death in battle, Beowulf becomes king and rules wisely for fifty years, bringing peace and prosperity to his people.

### Part 5: The Final Battle
When a slave steals a golden cup from a dragon's hoard, the enraged dragon begins terrorizing the Geats. Despite his age, Beowulf insists on facing the dragon alone. In the climactic battle, his sword fails, and his warriors flee in fear—except for young Wiglaf, who helps his king slay the dragon. However, Beowulf is mortally wounded by the dragon's venomous bite and dies after gazing upon the treasure he won for his people.
