# The New Wild
**Authors**: Fred Pearce | **Year**: 2015 | **Category**: Science & Nature

## Summary
Fred Pearce's "The New Wild" delivers a provocative challenge to conventional conservation wisdom by arguing that invasive species are not nature's destroyers but rather its salvation in the Anthropocene era. Pearce, an environmental journalist, confronts what he calls "green xenophobia" – the deep-seated belief among conservationists that native species are inherently good while alien species are inherently bad. Through extensive fieldwork across six continents, he reveals how most introduced species either die out quickly or become model ecological citizens that actually enhance biodiversity and ecosystem function.

The book argues that our fear of foreign species reflects human anxieties about change rather than ecological reality. Most invasive species, contrary to popular belief, are taking advantage of ecosystems already damaged by human activity, acting as opportunists and regenerators rather than destroyers. Pearce suggests that in our rapidly changing world, the success of alien species demonstrates nature's resilience and adaptability, offering hope for ecological recovery in human-dominated landscapes.

This book will benefit environmentalists, conservation professionals, ecologists, and anyone interested in challenging their assumptions about nature and conservation. Readers will gain a new perspective on ecological management and understand why traditional approaches to conservation may be counterproductive in the 21st century.

## Core Insights

### The Myth of Native Good, Alien Bad
The central ecological myth Pearce challenges is the simplistic equation that native species are good while alien species are bad. This belief system, he argues, resembles xenophobia and lacks scientific basis in our rapidly changing world. Most ecosystems today are already "novel" – mixtures of native and alien species that function together effectively.

> "Native is good, and alien is bad. But is this simple formula true? Or might we need the go-getter, can-do aliens? In fact, might their success be a sign of nature's resilience in the face of the considerable damage humans have done to the planet?"

**Quick Take**: Invasive species often perform essential ecological functions that native species cannot accomplish in disturbed environments, making them crucial for nature's recovery.

### Novel Ecosystems as the New Norm
Pearce introduces the concept of "novel ecosystems" – assemblages of native and alien species that have formed new, stable ecological relationships. These aren't degraded versions of original ecosystems but rather new configurations that often provide more ecosystem services and support more biodiversity than the disturbed systems they replaced.

> "They are often doing jobs that natives could not accomplish. They were opportunists, but also nature's regenerators."

**Quick Take**: Rather than fighting against these new ecological combinations, we should recognize them as legitimate expressions of nature's adaptability in the Anthropocene.

### Nature's Resilience Through Invasion
The book presents species invasion not as a threat but as evidence of nature's resilience. Invasive species demonstrate evolution in action – the ability of life to adapt, colonize new territories, and thrive in changing conditions. This resilience becomes increasingly valuable as climate change disrupts established ecosystems.

> "Far from being nature's destroyers, aliens may be its re-invigorators, its salvation. They may be a sign that nature is not done. That it can bounce back."

**Quick Take**: The most successful invasive species are precisely the kind of adaptable, opportunistic organisms that will help ecosystems survive rapid climate change.

### Conservation Needs a Paradigm Shift
Pearce argues that 21st-century conservation should focus on promoting ecological processes rather than preserving static species compositions. Instead of trying to recreate historical ecosystems, conservationists should embrace nature's dynamism and support successful colonizers, whether native or alien.

> "In the 21st century, rather than fighting a losing battle to protect what we imagine to be pristine nature, we should be encouraging nature's rebirth, often through the dynamism and invasive instincts of its alien species."

**Quick Take**: True conservation should back winners rather than losers, supporting species and ecological processes that demonstrate success in human-dominated landscapes.

## Best Quotes

- "Nature is not there to do our bidding. While alien species may sometimes be a pain in the neck for human society, they are exactly the shot in the arm that real nature needs."

- "We will not be going back to a supposedly pristine world. We cannot. We should be restoring nature's wildness, and not trying to turn one moment in the past into an ossified museum relic."

- "The success of aliens becomes a sign of nature's dynamism, not its enfeeblement."

- "Conservationists who want to cosset nature like a delicate flower, to protect it from the threat of alien species, are the ethnic cleansers of nature, neutralizing the forces of nature that they should be promoting."

- "The new wild will be different, but no less dramatic and wonderful than the old wild. Alien species, and the novel ecosystems they inhabit, will be at the heart of it."

## Takeaways

- **Rethink invasion**: Stop viewing species movement through a xenophobic lens that categorizes organisms as native "good" and alien "bad"

- **Embrace novelty**: Recognize novel ecosystems as legitimate and often beneficial expressions of nature's adaptability

- **Focus on function**: Prioritize ecological processes and services over species composition when assessing ecosystem health

- **Support winners**: Champion successful species and ecological combinations rather than only protecting endangered recluses

- **Accept change**: Understand that change, not stability, is the natural state of ecosystems, especially in the Anthropocene

## Questions to Consider

- Are our efforts to eradicate invasive species actually counterproductive to ecosystem recovery?

- How do we balance human preferences for familiar species with ecological benefits of novel communities?

- If most ecosystems are now novel, what should conservation's primary goals be in the 21st century?

- How can we distinguish between truly harmful invasive species and beneficial immigrants?

- What role should humans play in facilitating or resisting species movement in an era of rapid climate change?

## Conclusion

"The New Wild" is a challenging and necessary read for anyone concerned with conservation and environmental management. Pearce's arguments are well-supported by extensive fieldwork and scientific research, offering a compelling alternative to traditional conservation orthodoxy. While some readers may find his dismissal of ecological risks controversial, his core message – that we need to work with nature's dynamism rather than against it – is increasingly relevant in our rapidly changing world.

The book's greatest strength lies in its ability to reframe invasive species not as villains but as pioneers of ecological recovery. Pearce successfully demonstrates that much of traditional conservation is based on outdated assumptions about ecosystem stability and pristine nature. His vision of a "new wild" – messy, dynamic, and constantly evolving – offers hope for ecological resilience in the Anthropocene.

This is essential reading for conservationists, ecologists, and environmental policymakers who need to adapt their approaches to 21st-century realities. While Pearce's ideas may be uncomfortable for those committed to traditional conservation, they provide a crucial foundation for reimagining how we can support nature's recovery in human-dominated landscapes. The book challenges us to see beauty and value not in preserving what was, but in encouraging what might be.
