# In-Formed Businesses: Creating Success in Business
**Original Title**: Negócios in-formados: Criando o sucesso nos negócios
**Authors**: Hélio Couto, Mabel Cristina Dias | **Year**: 2015 

## Summary

"In-Formed Businesses" presents a revolutionary approach to business success that bridges quantum physics and entrepreneurial achievement. The authors propose that everything in the universe emits electromagnetic waves carrying "in-formation" (information), and by harnessing these frequencies through Harmonic Resonance, business owners can transform their enterprises and attract unlimited success.

The book challenges traditional business wisdom by arguing that external factors like economy and competition are secondary to the internal electromagnetic field that every person and business emanates. According to the authors, success depends not on conventional business strategies alone, but on understanding and manipulating the quantum field of information that governs all reality.

This practical guide is designed for entrepreneurs, business owners, and professionals who feel stuck despite having all the traditional resources for success, and who are open to exploring quantum physics as a tool for business transformation.

## Core Insights

### Quantum Physics Meets Business Success

The book explains how quantum physics discoveries from the last century have profound implications for business success. Everything in the universe—atoms, molecules, objects, people, and businesses—emits electromagnetic waves carrying specific frequencies and information. These frequencies attract similar frequencies through electromagnetic resonance.

> "The experiment of Aspect confirmed that the measurement made on a single photon affects its correlated partner, without any exchange of signals between them. This experiment leads us to build the thesis that there is a deep interaction between consciousness and matter."

The authors argue that by understanding these quantum principles, business owners can shift their electromagnetic field to attract success, clients, and opportunities rather than obstacles and failures.

### The Power of "In-Formation"

The authors introduce the concept of "in-formation" as the fundamental property of the universe that generates order, self-organization, and complexity. Unlike conventional data, this quantum information exists in wave form and is never lost—it persists eternally in the quantum vacuum and can be accessed by anyone.

> "Discovery has revealed that at the roots of reality there is not only matter and energy, but also a more subtle and equally fundamental factor—a factor we can best describe as active and effective information: 'in-formation'."

This means that all knowledge, skills, experiences, and success patterns from history's greatest entrepreneurs, leaders, and innovators are available through the quantum field and can be transferred to anyone through Harmonic Resonance.

### Harmonic Resonance Technology

The core of the book's practical application is the Harmonic Resonance technique, which allows users to access and integrate specific frequencies and information patterns from the quantum field. This technology uses CDs containing hidden frequency information that can be absorbed at the atomic level.

> "Through Harmonic Resonance, we can change the magnetism of the company by sending a specific frequency wave to that location. This wave can contain any desired information and will attract situations compatible with the frequency sent."

The process involves daily exposure to these frequencies, which gradually clear limiting beliefs and install new success-oriented patterns at the subconscious level, leading to transformed business results.

### Paradigm Shift Limitations

The authors identify several major obstacles that prevent business success:

1. **Limiting Beliefs**: Deep-seated convictions about what's possible that create self-imposed ceilings
2. **Paradigm Restriction**: Operating within an outdated mechanistic worldview rather than quantum reality
3. **Comfort Zone Addiction**: Resistance to growth and change even when it promises greater success
4. **Self-Sabotage**: Unconscious patterns that undermine progress when success approaches

> "The great issue is that, many times, people don't realize they have limiting beliefs and, when they do realize it, they believe it's very difficult or even impossible to change them."

### The Electromagnetic Nature of Success

Every business location, person, and situation emits an electromagnetic field that attracts corresponding experiences. A negative environment attracts problems, difficult clients, and obstacles. A positive environment attracts opportunities, ideal customers, and smooth operations.

> "Every positive person, business, or environment must have success, close good deals, and make money. There's no other way. The results obtained with the application of Harmonic Resonance in businesses prove this."

The authors claim that fifteen years of practical application show no exceptions to these electromagnetic principles—businesses with positive frequencies inevitably succeed.

## Best Quotes

- "We are reality-producing machines. We constantly create the effects of reality. If we draw information from a small knowledge base, we have a small reality. If we have a broad knowledge base, we have a broad reality."
  _Original: "Somos máquinas de produzir realidade. Criamos constantemente os efeitos da realidade. Se tirarmos informação de uma base de conhecimentos pequena, temos uma realidade pequena. Se temos uma base de conhecimento ampla, temos uma realidade ampla."_

- "Without changing your paradigm, progress is impossible, and those who cannot change their minds cannot change anything."
  _Original: "Sem mudança o progresso é impossível, e quem não pode mudar sua mente não pode mudar nada."_

- "Everything we think affects the magnetism of the business, the location, the people, etc. This happens because we emit a field with our thoughts and feelings, whether conscious or unconscious."
  _Original: "Tudo que o ser humano pensa afeta o magnetismo do negócio, do local, das pessoas, etc. Isso acontece porque ele emite um campo com seus pensamentos e sentimentos, sejam eles conscientes ou inconscientes."_

## Action Items

- **Assess Your Current Frequency**: Evaluate what thoughts, feelings, and beliefs you typically emit in business situations
- **Practice Conscious Frequency Choice**: Begin consciously choosing positive, success-oriented thoughts and emotions
- **Explore Quantum Information Access**: Consider how you might access the quantum field for business insights and solutions
- **Clear Limiting Beliefs**: Identify and work through deeply held convictions about what's possible in your business
- **Create Positive Business Environment**: Focus on shifting the electromagnetic field of your business location and team

## Questions to Consider

1. What electromagnetic frequency does your business currently emit? Are you attracting success or obstacles?
2. What limiting beliefs might be creating self-imposed ceilings on your business growth?
3. How would your business transform if you could access and integrate the knowledge and mindset of history's most successful entrepreneurs?
4. What would happen if you viewed every business challenge as a frequency mismatch rather than an external problem?
5. Are you willing to expand your paradigm beyond conventional business wisdom to embrace quantum possibilities?

## Conclusion

"In-Formed Businesses" presents a challenging but potentially revolutionary approach to business success that requires readers to question their fundamental understanding of reality. While the scientific claims may stretch credulity for some, the book offers a compelling framework for understanding how mindset, frequency, and quantum principles might influence business outcomes.

The biggest strength of this approach is its holistic view of success—one that integrates the physical, mental, emotional, and quantum aspects of business achievement. For entrepreneurs who have exhausted conventional strategies and are open to exploring new paradigms, this book offers both provocative ideas and practical tools for transformation.

However, readers should approach the scientific claims with discernment and recognize that this represents a frontier approach that exists outside mainstream business and scientific thinking. The book is most valuable as a catalyst for expanding one's conception of what's possible in business, rather than as a guaranteed formula for success.

For the right reader—one who combines openness to new ideas with discriminating judgment—this book could provide the missing piece that unlocks breakthrough results by shifting from doing business in a mechanistic universe to operating as a conscious creator in a quantum field of infinite possibilities.
