# The Idiot

Fyodor Dostoyevsky (1869)

***

The Idiot, a literary masterpiece published in 1869, unfolds as a sprawling novel that intricately weaves together a complex narrative and structure. At its core is the enigmatic Prince Myshkin, a kind-hearted and innocent man plagued by the challenges of epilepsy, which is often dismissed by others as a fool or an idiot. Returning to his homeland of Russia after a prolonged vacation in Switzerland, Prince Myshkin embarks on encounters and friendships that shape his fate.

The central thread of the narrative revolves around the Prince's deep and complicated emotions. He is irresistibly drawn to Nastassya Filippovna, a complex and tormented woman who repeatedly humiliates and rejects his love. Simultaneously, he develops feelings for Aglaya Epanchina, a captivating and spirited young woman whose allure captivates him. The triangle of love and longing between these characters serves as a focal point, exploring the intricate dynamics of desire, vulnerability, and the complexities of human connection.

As the novel progresses, tensions rise, and the Prince's inner turmoil intertwines with the unfolding events. The murder of Nastassya Filippovna, a shocking and tragic incident, catalyses the Prince's descent into the depths of his illness. The fragile balance of his sanity and his struggle with epilepsy become increasingly fragile, leading to a profound exploration of the human condition and the delicate boundary between sanity and madness.

Amidst the intricate plot and the interplay of characters, The Idiot delves into profound philosophical inquiries. The narrative serves as a vehicle for the author to raise thought-provoking questions about God's nature, evil's existence, and the complexities of free will. Dostoevsky skillfully utilises the twists and tensions between the characters to prompt introspection and contemplation, inviting readers to ponder the deeper aspects of human existence and wrestle with profound existential dilemmas.

Through its richly layered storytelling and profound philosophical underpinnings, The Idiot is a testament to Dostoevsky's literary genius. The novel invites readers into a world of complex characters, intricate relationships, and philosophical musings, encouraging them to question humanity's nature and grapple with life's profound mysteries.

## Storyline

Lebedyev, Rogozhin, and Prince Nikolayevich Myshkin, who has returned to Russia after seeking treatment for his epileptic fits in Switzerland, find themselves in the same third-class carriage. Upon their arrival in St Petersburg, Prince Myshkin pays a visit to the wife of General Epanchin, who is also distantly related to him. Intrigued by her, the Prince hopes to establish a connection with her. Though initially wary, the general eventually invites him into their circle and thus begins the Prince's integration into the Epanchins' social group.

Meanwhile, Afanasy Ivanovich Totsky, a middle-aged man, harbours a desire to marry one of General Epanchin's daughters. However, his plans are complicated by his past actions. Years ago, he took in an orphaned young girl named Nastassya Filippovna, but her character has changed significantly as she has grown into adulthood. Totsky fears that she threatens his happiness and his potential marriage. Accompanied by the general, he confronts Nastassya to address the issue, seeking a resolution yet remaining anxious about the outcome.

Within the Epanchin household, Prince Myshkin is introduced to the general's wife and their three daughters: Alexandra, Adelaida, and Aglaya. They engage in a conversation spanning various topics, including the Prince's ancestry, personal history, and past struggles with epilepsy. The Prince, candidly referring to himself as an "idiot" due to the frequency of his fits during his youth, delves into discussions on art and life with the Epanchin family.

During their train journey, Rogozhin, intensely fascinated with Nastassya Filippovna, mentions her to Prince Myshkin. Concerned for her well-being, the Prince feels compelled to warn her against marrying Gavrila Ardalionovich, as he believes Ardalionovich is only interested in her wealth. In a state of drunkenness, Rogozhin arrives with a large sum of money, intending to offer it to Nastassya for a night together. However, Nastassya passionately condemns the greed and materialism of men.

Caught amid these emotional exchanges, Prince Myshkin falls in love with Nastassya. Overwhelmed by his feelings, he offers to marry her, hoping to rescue her from a potentially unhappy fate. However, Nastassya humiliates and rejects him, choosing instead to elope with Rogozhin, leaving the Prince heartbroken and bewildered by the turn of events.

After inheriting a substantial sum from one of his aunts, the Prince embarks on a journey to Moscow, intending to spend the next six months organising his financial matters. During this time, he becomes increasingly concerned about Nastassya Filippovna's impending marriage to Rogozhin. Recognising the potential harm in this union, the Prince attempts to dissuade Rogozhin from going through with it. However, their conversation turns dangerous when Rogozhin, perceiving the Prince as a romantic rival, decides to kill him. In a twist of fate, the Prince suffers a sudden epileptic seizure, and Rogozhin, startled by the unexpected turn of events, flees the scene.

Following the traumatic encounter, the Prince finds refuge and care in the home of Lebedyev during his recovery. Lebedyev provides solace and support, offering a temporary sanctuary where the Prince can regain his strength and stability.

However, the Prince's respite is soon disrupted when an article accuses him of withholding Mr Burdovsky's rightful share of the inheritance. Burdovsky, believed to be the son of Pavlishchev, comes forward with claims against the Prince. In response, the Prince provides a thorough explanation, effectively refuting the allegations and exposing Burdovsky as part of an elaborate scheme. It becomes apparent that Burdovsky has been manipulated and is not, in fact, the legitimate son of Pavlishchev.

Through careful examination and evidence, the Prince manages to expose the truth, revealing the deceitful nature of the situation. His efforts clear his name and shed light on the manipulation and deception orchestrated by those seeking to exploit his fortune.

The Prince's integrity and determination to seek justice shine through these tumultuous events. Despite his setbacks and challenges, he remains steadfast in his pursuit of truth and fairness, determined to unravel the complexities and falsehoods surrounding him.

Lizaveta Prokofyevna, the general's wife, is consumed with thoughts about her three daughters and their potential marriages. Troubled by the rumours of a relationship between the Prince and her daughter Aglaya, she becomes increasingly agitated. However, their relationship remains platonic despite the Prince's affection for Aglaya. The Prince clarifies his intentions by assuring Aglaya that he has no plans to propose to her. This revelation further complicates the love triangle between the woman and the Prince, leading to heightened conflict and tension.

Amidst the unfolding drama, another incident occurs during the Prince's birthday celebration. A young man named Ippolit, who suffers from tuberculosis, presents a document detailing his reasons for contemplating suicide. In a shocking turn of events, he attempts to shoot himself in the head, but he survives the ordeal due to a fortuitous mistake of forgetting to load the gun. This dramatic episode leaves everyone in attendance startled and deeply affected by the fragility of life and the struggles individuals like Ippolit face.

Meanwhile, Nastassya Filippovna expresses her emotions for the Prince through letters sent to Aglaya. In these heartfelt messages, Nastassya reveals her profound love for the Prince and compares Aglaya's essence to that of an angelâ€”light and incapable of hatred. Seeking answers and perhaps a glimmer of hope, Nastassya seeks a meeting with Myshkin to gain insights into the Prince's feelings. However, Rogozhin escorts her back, disrupting the delicate balance of emotions. In a moment of vulnerability, the Prince confesses to Nastassya that he is unhappy, hinting at the internal turmoil and conflicting emotions he experiences amid this intricate love triangle.

As these events unfold, the intricate web of relationships becomes increasingly tangled, leading the characters to question their desires, loyalties, and personal happiness. The complex dynamics between the Prince, Aglaya, and Nastassya drive the narrative deeper into emotional turmoil and introspection, challenging the characters to confront their deepest desires and the consequences of their choices.

The relationship between Aglaya and the Prince is a constant source of ambiguity and complexity. While Aglaya holds deep feelings for the Prince, she struggles to fully accept him due to his peculiarities and unconventional nature. Despite her love for him, she publicly rejects him, unable to reconcile his uniqueness with societal norms. This tension between their connection and Aglaya's desire for conformity adds a layer of emotional complexity to their relationship.

An unexpected turn of events unfolds during a grand party hosted by the Epanchins, where they hope to introduce the Prince to the world. The Prince, impassioned by his beliefs, delivers a fiery speech on religion. In a moment of clumsiness, he accidentally breaks a valuable vase, disrupting the atmosphere. Despite the mishap, the Prince attempts to continue his speech but is suddenly overcome by an epileptic fit, collapsing before the bewildered audience.

Once the Prince has recovered from his episode, Aglaya arranges a meeting with Nastassya and Rogozhin for an open and honest discussion. During this confrontation, Aglaya accuses Nastassya of tormenting the Prince, rejecting his love, and obstructing their relationship. However, ever empathetic and compassionate, the Prince comes to Nastassya's defence, attempting to calm Aglaya's anger and protect Nastassya from undue blame. This defence only exacerbates Aglaya's frustration, causing her to flee in emotional distress. In a desperate attempt to salvage the situation, the Prince chases after Aglaya, leaving Nastassya behind.

The moment's intensity takes a toll on Nastassya, and she loses consciousness. Sensing her vulnerability, the Prince remains by her side, providing comfort and support. In this moment of connection and exposure, the Prince admits his fear of Nastassya but also confesses his love for her, acknowledging that he has conflicting emotions towards Aglaya. Eventually, the Prince and Nastassya marry, hoping to find solace and stability in their union.

However, their plans are shattered on the day of their wedding when Nastassya elopes with Rogozhin, leaving the Prince devastated and filled with a sense of betrayal. Determined to find Nastassya, the Prince embarks on a desperate search. His quest leads him to a tragic discoveryâ€”Rogozhin, standing over the lifeless body of Nastassya, whom he has brutally murdered. Overwhelmed by grief and shock, the Prince witnesses the sad consequences of their tangled relationship.

Meanwhile, Aglaya, defying her family's wishes, marries a man she believes to be a Polish Count. However, it soon becomes apparent that her chosen partner is a fraud, leading to further turmoil and disillusionment in her personal life.

In the final chapters of this intricate tale, the characters' paths intertwine in a web of tragedy, heartbreak, and shattered illusions. Their relationships, built on love, desire, and conflicting emotions, ultimately unravel, leaving them to confront the consequences of their choices and the depths of their vulnerabilities.
