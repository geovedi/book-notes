"Biological Exuberance" by Bruce Bagemihl explores the prevalence of homosexual, bisexual, and transgender behavior in the natural world. The book highlights over 450 different species worldwide that exhibit homosexual behavior, challenging traditional notions of sexuality and pair-bonding in the animal kingdom. The author discusses the diverse forms and frequencies of same-sex behavior, as well as homosexual pair-bonding and parenting in various animal species.

The book also examines the intersection of animal homosexuality and human perspectives. Zoologists have observed and documented homosexual behavior in numerous animal species, cautioning against anthropomorphizing these observations. The similarities and differences between animal and human homosexuality are discussed, emphasizing the complexity of sexual orientation in both animals and humans.

The historical context of studying animal homosexuality is explored, including biases, negative attitudes, and homophobia that have influenced scientific discourse. Several flawed explanations for animal homosexuality, such as imitation, mistake, and pathology, are examined, with the book challenging these perspectives. The role of reproduction in animal homosexuality is also discussed, with some scientists proposing various hypotheses, but lacking consistent evidence.

The book introduces the concept of "Biological Exuberance," which combines indigenous and modern perspectives to observe the natural world. Indigenous cultures worldwide have traditional beliefs about animal homosexuality and transgender, aligning with some scientific findings. The collaboration between indigenous knowledge and Western science has led to important discoveries, challenging traditional evolutionary explanations.

"Biological Exuberance" offers a more inclusive and polysexual view of the natural world, celebrating the diversity and complexity of sexual behaviors in animals. It encourages a shift in perspective to embrace the rich and multifaceted nature of life forms. The book challenges the notion that animal homosexuality is abnormal, offering a comprehensive understanding of the vast range of sexual behaviors found in the animal kingdom.

## The Birds and the Bees

The natural world is teeming with instances of homosexual, bisexual, and transgender behavior among animals, with more than 450 different species worldwide exhibiting homosexual behavior. Animal homosexuality is not a uniform phenomenon and displays various forms and frequencies. Almost 40 percent of mammals and birds with same-sex activity also engage in same-sex courtship behaviors, which often involve affectionate actions like grooming, embracing, and play-fighting. Sexual behaviors in animals include mounting, genital stimulation, and various types of penetration, and more than 25 different species engage in group sexual activities.

Homosexual pair-bonding and parenting are observed in several animal species, with same-sex bonding categorized into "partners" engaging in sexual or courtship activities and "companions" bonded but not necessarily sexually active. Successful homosexual parenting is documented in many cases, with same-sex pairs often displaying competent and even superior parenting skills compared to heterosexual pairs. While male homosexuality is slightly more prevalent than female homosexuality across species, both are found in a significant number of species.

Homosexual behavior challenges traditional notions of sexuality and pair-bonding in the animal kingdom and is observed in a wide range of species, including carnivores, marsupials, waterfowl, shorebirds, marine mammals, and perching birds. Some species exhibit same-sex behavior exclusively among males or females, and gender differences are evident in various behavior types such as courtship, affectionate, sexual, pair-bonding, and parenting activities. However, the frequency of homosexual behavior varies widely within and between species, making generalizations difficult.

Quantifying the prevalence of homosexuality in animal populations poses challenges due to limited observations and varying behaviors. Nevertheless, scientists use various methods, such as measuring frequency rates and activity budgets, to assess the occurrence of homosexual behavior in different species. The percentage of individuals engaging in homosexual activity varies widely among species, with approximately 25% of individuals involved in same-sex activity in species where it occurs.

Beyond homosexuality, hermaphroditism and parthenogenesis are also found in some animal species, where individuals possess both male and female reproductive organs or reproduce without mating, respectively. Additionally, transvestism and transsexuality exist in the animal kingdom, where individuals traverse existing gender categories by imitating the opposite sex behaviorally, visually, or chemically or by undergoing physical sex changes.

Animal sexuality and gender are far more diverse and complex than the traditional binary view of male and female sexes. Many animals live without clear-cut gender distinctions, and some species exhibit hermaphroditism, where all individuals are both male and female simultaneously. Transsexuality, seen in certain fish species, involves complete reversals of sex. The study of animal sexuality reveals a multifaceted and fluid range of behaviors, surpassing conventional human imagination.

## Humanistic Animals, Animalistic Humans

The presence of homosexual behavior in various animal species is well-documented, with examples found in Gorillas, Bottlenose Dolphins, Manatees, Bonobos, Macaques, Gibbons, Hedgehogs, and more. Zoologists, while studying these behaviors, often give names to the animals involved, but caution must be exercised to avoid anthropomorphizing their observations. Animal homosexuality is diverse, exhibiting various forms similar to the diversity observed in human homosexuality. However, when comparing animal and human homosexuality, several factors such as social contexts, consensuality, age, gender presentation, genetic relatedness, and social status must be taken into account.

Homosexual behaviors in animals are not limited to one type, and many species engage in exclusive or long-term homosexuality, challenging the notion that it is unique to humans. Bisexuality is widespread among animal species, and there are shared commonalities and variations between animal and human homosexualities, blurring the lines between nature and culture and highlighting the complexity of sexual orientation in both animals and humans. Animal sexuality encompasses a wide range of behaviors, including bisexuality and exclusive homosexuality, and some species, such as Bonobos, exhibit a high prevalence of bisexual behavior among individuals.

Sexual orientation in animals can vary within a population, from predominantly heterosexual to predominantly homosexual and everything in between. Homosexual behavior is generally accepted and integrated into the social fabric of the species, with little hostility or segregation. In some cases, homosexual individuals can attain high social status or form powerful alliances within their groups. Instances of aggression towards homosexual individuals are rare and are usually observed in males attempting to interfere with homosexual activity between females to gain access to one of them. Transgendered individuals may face aggression from nontransgendered members of their species in certain cases, as seen with White-tailed Deer. However, the formation of separate groups by homosexual individuals or pairs is usually due to factors other than their sexuality, such as age, sex, breeding status, or social rank.

The observation of homosexual behavior in various animal species underscores its prevalence beyond just humans. Primates, including monkeys and apes, engage in same-sex activity, and some species display homosexual consortships where individuals isolate themselves physically and socially to spend time together. Homosexual pairs in some species may serve as "sentinels" or guards for the group. Homosexual Mallard Ducks, for instance, prefer each other's company and tend to form their own flocks. The virtual absence of segregated subgroups of homosexuals in the animal world is likely due to a lack of overt hostility towards homosexuality among animals.

Comparing human heterosexuality and homosexuality reveals differences, but both can be found in certain animal species. The presence of homosexuality in primates, our evolutionary relatives, suggests it is part of our heritage. Furthermore, some animal species exhibit cultural traditions related to sexuality, including homosexual activity, which can be passed on through learning and observation. Sexuality in primates, including nonreproductive sexual activities and homosexual behaviors, may have contributed to the development of significant cultural milestones considered to be defining characteristics of "humanness."

Bonobos, in particular, display a sophisticated system of gestural communication used specifically during sexual interactions, with about a dozen hand and arm gestures each having specific meanings. This gestural system may represent a precursor to human language. The pursuit of sexual pleasure in primates, including the use of objects for sexual stimulation, may have played a role in the development of human tool use and material culture.

Incest taboos, widespread cultural norms in human societies, have counterparts in some primate species, like Japanese Macaques and Hanuman Langurs, which show specific restrictions on same-sex relationships between close relatives. These taboos involve cultural characteristics and social learning, indicating that they are not solely due to instinct or genetic factors.

Observations of ritualized homosexual activities, such as "diddling," in male Savanna Baboons may have influenced human rituals like oath-taking. The debate about the "naturalness" of homosexuality in animals is flawed and oversimplified, as many behaviors occur in nature that are not necessarily considered "natural" in humans. The significance of animal sexuality lies in what humans ascribe to them, often justifying opinions about human homosexuality based on animal behavior. The occurrence of homosexual behavior in animals has implications for understanding the complex interplay between biology, environment, culture, and social development.

Homosexuality is a part of the "natural history" of animals, exhibiting biological and historical dimensions that are interconnected and complex. The presence of homosexual behavior extends beyond nonhuman primates and can also be observed in domesticated animals, confirming its presence beyond our closest relatives. Paradoxically, same-sex activities are used in breeding programs as indicators of reproductive readiness or to arouse animals for semen collection. People's interpretations of animal homosexuality are influenced by their own beliefs and attitudes towards human homosexuality, and biased views have sometimes been held by biologists themselves, reflecting societal attitudes rather than scientific objectivity.

## Two Hundred Years of Looking at Homosexual Wildlife

Animal homosexuality has been observed and recorded since ancient times, with early accounts dating back to ancient Greece and Egypt. In the 18th century, naturalists like Buffon and Edwards made significant strides in the modern scientific study of animal homosexuality, particularly in birds. Over the years, the field has expanded, with nearly 600 scientific articles and publications exploring same-sex behavior in various species. However, the scientific study of animal homosexuality has faced biases, negative attitudes, and homophobia, mirroring the treatment of human homosexuality in society. Derogatory terms like "abnormal" and "perverse" have been used to describe animal homosexuality, and negative value judgments have been unjustly attached to same-sex activities.

Researchers have sometimes subjected animals to extreme experimental treatments to study homosexuality, similar to misguided attempts to "cure" human homosexuality. Despite the vast amount of scientific information on animal homosexuality, much of it remains inaccessible, and many popular works on animals omit any mention of same-sex behavior. The history of scientific attitudes toward animal homosexuality reflects the history of human attitudes, underscoring the role of culture and bias in shaping scientific discourse. Biased language and unwarranted assumptions have been used by some scientists when discussing homosexual behavior in animals.

Animal homosexuality is often dismissed as abnormal or unnatural, with researchers sometimes using terms like "mock courtship" or "sham mating" to describe same-sex interactions. Some researchers display a double standard by interpreting same-sex behavior negatively, associating it with instability or inadequacy, while overlooking similar issues in opposite-sex pairs. Heterosexuality is often presumed as the default, leading researchers to ignore or misinterpret same-sex activity unless it is explicitly proven. Some scientists use euphemistic or neutral terms like "male-male" or "female-female" activity instead of "homosexual" to avoid connotations and stigma, but this approach may inadvertently undermine the recognition of genuine homosexual behavior.

Anthropomorphizing is more common in discussions of heterosexual behavior, while same-sex behavior is often viewed more critically and skeptically. Information challenging heteronormative assumptions about animal behavior may be overlooked or suppressed. The denial and misconceptions surrounding animal homosexuality mirror those found in discussions of human homosexuality. Unbiased and comprehensive studies of animal behavior are needed to gain a full understanding of the diverse spectrum of sexual and social interactions in the animal kingdom.

There is no single type of same-sex pair-bonding in humans or animals, and homosexual couples vary vastly in factors like sexual behavior, social status, formation process, sexual orientation, and parenting. The term "homosexual" should be used broadly to encompass behaviors like courtship, pair-bonding, and parenting activities between animals of the same sex. Homosexual activity is often marginalized or trivialized, while exhaustive coverage is given to heterosexual interactions, leading to distorted perceptions of its prevalence or significance.

A double standard exists in evaluating the prevalence of heterosexual and homosexual behavior in animals, with some researchers reluctant to use the term "homosexual" and offering alternative interpretations or explanations for same-sex behavior. Homosexuality in animals is often overlooked or omitted in scientific literature, perpetuating misinformation and misconceptions about its occurrence. The suppression of information on animal homosexuality echoes the stigma and silence surrounding discussions of human homosexuality in the past.

Researchers have attempted to explain same-sex behavior as non-sexual activities, such as "greeting," "reassurance," or "dominance" behavior, but dominance-based interpretations are often inadequate and inconsistent across species. Dominance is not a sufficient or necessary condition for homosexual behavior in animals, and many same-sex interactions are reciprocal and do not fit neatly into dominance-based interpretations. The concept of dominance in animal behavior is complex and context-dependent and should not be overgeneralized or used as the sole explanation for homosexual behavior.

Phenomena like leadership, attention-structure, social facilitation, and inhibition provide insights into primate social interaction. Competition and cooperation in social primates are intertwined rather than opposing forces, and both female and male primates play significant roles in alliance systems. Dominance analysis of animal homosexuality lacks broad evidence and has been refuted by later, more careful investigations of the phenomenon. Homosexual behavior has been classified as nonsexual and attributed various alternative "functions," but the complex relationship between sexual and nonsexual aspects of behavior needs careful examination.

The relationship between sexual and nonsexual aspects of behavior is intricate and defies rigid categorizations based solely on same-sex or opposite-sex participants. Same-sex interactions can serve a wide range of functions, including greeting, tension reduction, play, reassurance, and more, while still being sexual interactions at the same time. By recognizing the sexual component of same-sex behaviors and the nonsexual aspects of heterosexual behaviors, a more comprehensive understanding of animal life and sexuality can be achieved.

## Explaining (Away) Animal Homosexuality

In August 1995, a groundbreaking symposium on sexual orientation in animals took place at the 24th International Ethological Conference, officially recognizing animal homosexuality as a legitimate field of study. However, the conference primarily focused on hormonal and neurological differences between male and female behaviors, perpetuating the view of homosexuality as gender "inversion" or "atypical" behavior. Despite the presence of zoologists with firsthand observations of homosexual behavior in the wild, their knowledge was mostly overlooked, and the scientific discourse surrounding animal homosexuality remained fixated on finding explanations, neglecting the diversity and prevalence of same-sex activity in the animal kingdom.

Several flawed and outdated "explanations" for animal homosexuality, including imitation of heterosexuality, substitute activity, mistake, and pathological condition, have been proposed. These explanations were once used to pathologize and condemn human homosexuality, highlighting biased attitudes in both human and animal homosexuality discussions. The "pseudoheterosexual" interpretation of animal homosexuality assumes same-sex interactions mimic heterosexual behaviors, but this perspective doesn't hold true in many species, where unique homosexual behaviors occur. Reciprocal homosexual behaviors are common, and neither partner can be strictly assigned to a "male" or "female" role, challenging the traditional gender-based interpretation.

The complex gender roles in same-sex interactions among animals are multidimensional and not easily classified as "homosexual" or "heterosexual" based on perceived gender roles. Genuine transgender behaviors can occur in same-sex interactions and heterosexual contexts, further demonstrating the intricacy of sexual behaviors in the animal kingdom. The prevalence of transgender and gender roles in same-sex interactions underscores the diversity of sexual behaviors in animals and challenges simplistic categorizations.

Homosexuality in animals cannot be attributed solely to a shortage of opposite-sex partners, as same-sex activity occurs even when potential mates are available. Some species with unbalanced sex ratios display same-sex activity in only one sex, indicating that factors beyond mate availability influence homosexual behavior. Homosexual activity may be an expression of individual variability and sexual orientation rather than a response to sex ratio imbalances. Same-sex interactions often exhibit remarkable longevity and durability, resisting attempts to "convert" individuals to heterosexuality when opposite-sex partners become available.

Studies have suggested a correlation between environmental toxins and same-sex pairing in certain bird populations, but the explanation has limited applicability and supporting evidence. The assumption that sex misidentification is a widespread cause of homosexuality is also questionable, as many species exhibit same-sex behavior despite clear visual differences between sexes. Animals often preferentially court and mate with specific sexes, even in species with similar-looking males and females, indicating some level of sex differentiation.

The occurrence of homosexuality and transgender behavior is not solely a result of captivity, as both have been observed in wild and captive animals alike. Captive studies often confirm observations of homosexuality in the wild, suggesting that it is part of the normal behavioral repertoire. The distinction between wild and captive animals is not always clear, as there is a continuum of degrees of confinement and human intervention in animals' living conditions.

Hormonal imbalances and physical abnormalities have been suggested as potential explanations for homosexual behavior in animals, but little evidence supports these claims. The pathologizing of gender-atypical behavior and transgender animals is based on arbitrary categorizations and biased conceptual categories. Transgendered animals can thrive in the wild and be fully integrated members of their social groups, challenging the notion that they are abnormal due to their inability to reproduce. The prevalence of homosexuality and transgender behavior in various species, both in captivity and the wild, indicates that they are long-standing and regular features of natural animal populations.

The pathologizing of homosexuality and transgender behavior in animals is rooted in the idea that they are dysfunctional because they do not lead to reproduction. However, nonbreeding animals, including transgender individuals, can be healthier than breeders as they avoid the physical stresses of the breeding season. The next chapter will explore the complex interrelationships between procreation and homosexuality, bisexuality, transgender, and heterosexuality in the animal kingdom. It will challenge fundamental assumptions about the significance of reproduction in understanding animal behavior.


## Not for Breeding Only: Reproduction on the Periphery of Life

Homosexuality and reproduction in animals often intersect in unexpected and paradoxical ways. Some scientists have suggested that same-sex activity might play a role in reproduction or the survival of species. However, various "positive" explanations for animal homosexuality have been proposed, but they lack consistency across different species. Hypotheses proposing that homosexual animals act as "helpers" in raising relatives' offspring or regulating population growth have little supporting evidence. Bisexuality is prevalent in the animal kingdom, with some individuals engaging in both same-sex and opposite-sex interactions, indicating their capacity for reproduction and passing on genes. Bisexual individuals may even outperform exclusively heterosexual individuals in reproduction and attracting opposite-sex partners, challenging traditional assumptions. Despite ongoing controversies regarding the genetics of homosexuality, further long-term studies of large animal populations are needed for a comprehensive understanding of homosexuality's role in the animal kingdom.

James A. Mills conducted a longitudinal study on Silver Gulls in New Zealand to investigate the reproductive success of bisexual individuals compared to heterosexual ones. The results showed that bisexual individuals had significantly fewer successful breeders compared to heterosexual ones. Interestingly, the lower reproductive output of bisexual females was independent of whether they were breeding with a male or female partner. Some species with same-sex activity exhibit lower reproductive success due to interference with heterosexual mating or parenting. Most reports of same-sex parenting in other species align with the Silver Gull results, failing to show bisexual superiority. However, studies of bisexual animals' reproductive success in other species are limited and inconclusive. Even among species with widespread bisexuality, individuals differ significantly in their degree of bisexuality, and its correlation with breeding success is not straightforward. In many species, homosexuality or bisexuality is only found in individuals of one sex, contrary to what the bisexual-superiority hypothesis would predict. Specific cases that seem to support the bisexual-superiority hypothesis have alternative explanations and are not definitive evidence. Genetic differences alone do not fully explain the expression of homosexuality in species like the Ruff, as social and behavioral factors are also at play. Homosexuality in animals is likely to have a genetic component, but social, behavioral, and individual factors are equally important. Particularly in complex social animals like primates, homosexuality may serve social functions or have cultural dimensions.

The evolutionary purpose of homosexual behavior in animals is a subject of scientific debate. Some scientists propose that homosexual behavior may be useful in practicing heterosexual mating or gaining sexual experience, but this is not a widely accepted explanation. Homosexual behavior is not limited to younger or sexually inexperienced animals, which challenges the "practice" interpretation. The presence of discontinuities in homosexual behavior participation further weakens the "practice" explanation. Although some argue that homosexuality could reinforce group cohesion and social bonds or attract opposite-sex partners, these interpretations often lack solid evidence. In most species, homosexual behavior does not directly stimulate heterosexual mating. There is also a gender bias in the application of the "practice" interpretation, with it being mostly applied to male animals and not females. While same-sex pairing in birds is sometimes seen as a parenting strategy, the evidence does not fully support this interpretation. Same-sex parenting arrangements are not common in birds, and the presumed advantages are often not evident in the data. Birds display different forms of same-sex parenting, indicating a more complex behavior than simple coparenting. Homosexual pairing occurs across various animal species, challenging the assumption that mating is solely for reproduction. It does not necessarily relate to an animal's ability to raise young without a partner, as some species' females can raise young successfully without male assistance, yet they still form same-sex pairs. Generally, homosexual pairing is not a widespread mechanism for achieving two-parent care in most pair-bonding birds. Same-sex pairing is observed in many species where single parents routinely raise young successfully, suggesting it's not solely for parenting assistance. In some cases, homosexual associations may even be detrimental to parenting and reproductive success.

Various speculative and implausible explanations about the function of homosexuality have been proposed, often based on misconceptions. Many animals exhibit nonreproductive and alternative heterosexual behaviors, which occur outside the breeding season, during menstruation, pregnancy, and even after birth. Heterosexual mating and parenting arrangements are diverse, featuring various family constellations. Animals also display homosexual behaviors, demonstrating that same-sex pairings are not unique to humans. Infanticide and abortion occur in certain animal species, sometimes as reproductive strategies or opportunities. Animals may adopt and care for young from other individuals or species, suggesting a more complex social structure. Moreover, sexual pleasure appears to play a role in animal behavior, challenging conventional biological theories focused solely on reproduction. Nonreproductive and alternative heterosexual behaviors, once stigmatized like homosexuality, are now recognized as normal aspects of social and sexual organization in many species. Biologists often seek functional explanations for these behaviors, just as they do for homosexuality, but these behaviors may also have intrinsic value beyond procreative purposes.

Biology's "present ignorance" stems from its single-minded focus on finding reproductive explanations for diverse sexualities and genders. The next chapter will delve into how biology can reconcile itself with the existence and apparent "purposelessness" of various behaviors, sexualities, and genders observed in the natural world. An image of two male chimpanzees and a female squirrel monkey kissing is provided as an example of affectionate behavior in animals, challenging the perception of sexual behaviors solely for reproduction.

## A New Paradigm: Biological Exuberance

Homosexuality in animals has been viewed as abnormal by societies that consider gay people to be anomalous. Western science has grappled with explaining animal homosexuality for over two centuries, but its focus on reproduction has presented challenges. In contrast, indigenous and tribal cultures often recognize and accept gender and sexuality as inherently multiple and mutable in both animals and humans.

Aboriginal worldviews exhibit sophisticated ideas about the natural world, revealing striking correspondences with recent scientific discoveries. This leads to the introduction of the concept of Biological Exuberance, which seeks to combine indigenous and modern perspectives to observe the natural world.

Native American tribes, for example, honor and recognize human homosexuality and transgender individuals as "two-spirit" people, who play significant roles in their communities. Indigenous cultures across the globe have traditional beliefs about animal homosexuality and transgender, which they encode in totemic associations, myths, ceremonial reenactments, and animal husbandry practices.

Ritual enactments of same-sex activity are present in various Native American tribes, and New Guinea and Melanesia also incorporate beliefs about animal homosexuality and transgender in their human social and ceremonial interactions.

The cassowary, a bird from New Guinea and northern Australia, holds a prominent place in indigenous cultures as an androgynous or gender-mixing creature. Vanuatu cultures have rituals involving homosexual acts and gender-mixing, often centered around the image of the shark.

Siberian and Arctic cultures also practice animal homosexuality and gender transformation, particularly among shamans. Reindeer are regarded as powerful transgendered figures in some Arctic cultures, and Siberian Bear ceremonialism involves ritual killing of a bear, incorporating transgressions of gender and sexual boundaries.

Indigenous cultures perceive alternative systems of gender and sexuality in animals, often associating them totemically or symbolically with homosexuality and transgender. They value and ceremonialize hermaphrodite and nonbreeding animals, honoring creatures that combine aspects of maleness and femaleness.

Modern scientific observations have confirmed evidence of same-sex behavior and intersexuality in some animals, aligning with indigenous beliefs. The similarities between indigenous views and scientific findings raise questions about the accuracy and wisdom of indigenous knowledge about animals' sexuality and gender.

The collaboration between indigenous knowledge and Western science has led to important discoveries and challenges traditional functional explanations based on evolution. Biological Exuberance represents a fundamental shift in perspective, offering an alternative vision of animal behaviors previously misunderstood or overlooked by Western science.

The concept combines post-Darwinian evolution, chaos theory, and biodiversity studies, highlighting the extravagant and unpredictable nature of life on Earth. Indigenous cosmologies and scientific perspectives converge, recognizing the importance of indigenous knowledge in understanding biodiversity and ecological systems.

Ultimately, Biological Exuberance celebrates the diversity and bounty of life, affirming life's vitality and infinite possibilities in terms of gender and sexuality. It offers a more inclusive and polysexual view of the natural world, embracing the complexity and richness of all living beings.
