## The Birds and the Bees
- Animal homosexuality, bisexual, and transgender behavior are widespread in nature.
- More than 450 different species worldwide exhibit homosexual behavior.
- Almost 40% of mammals and birds with same-sex activity engage in same-sex courtship behaviors.
- Sexual behaviors in animals include mounting, genital stimulation, and various types of penetration.
- Over 25 different species engage in group sexual activities.
- Homosexual pair-bonding and parenting are observed in several animal species.
- Successful homosexual parenting is documented in many cases, with same-sex pairs displaying competent parenting skills.
- Male homosexuality is slightly more prevalent than female homosexuality across species.
- Homosexual behavior challenges traditional notions of sexuality and pair-bonding in the animal kingdom.
- Observed in carnivores, marsupials, waterfowl, shorebirds, marine mammals, and perching birds.
- Gender differences are evident in various behavior types such as courtship, affectionate, sexual, pair-bonding, and parenting activities.
- The prevalence of homosexuality in animal populations varies widely within and between species.
- Scientists use various methods, such as frequency rates and activity budgets, to assess the occurrence of homosexual behavior in different species.
- Hermaphroditism and parthenogenesis are also found in some animal species.
- Transvestism and transsexuality exist in the animal kingdom, where individuals imitate the opposite sex behaviorally, visually, or chemically.
- Some species exhibit hermaphroditism, where all individuals are both male and female simultaneously.
- Transsexuality involves complete reversals of sex and is seen in certain fish species.
- Animal sexuality and gender are diverse and complex, surpassing conventional human imagination.

## Humanistic Animals, Animalistic Humans
- Homosexual, bisexual, and transgender behavior is well-documented in various animal species.
- Examples of animal homosexuality include Gorillas, Bottlenose Dolphins, Manatees, Bonobos, Macaques, Gibbons, Hedgehogs, and more.
- Zoologists study these behaviors but must avoid anthropomorphizing their observations.
- Animal homosexuality exhibits various forms and frequencies, similar to the diversity observed in human homosexuality.
- Factors such as social contexts, consensuality, age, gender presentation, genetic relatedness, and social status must be considered when comparing animal and human homosexuality.
- Homosexual behaviors are not limited to one type, and many species engage in exclusive or long-term homosexuality.
- Bisexuality is widespread among animal species, and shared commonalities and variations exist between animal and human homosexualities.
- Animal sexuality encompasses a wide range of behaviors, including bisexuality and exclusive homosexuality.
- Sexual orientation can vary within animal populations, from predominantly heterosexual to predominantly homosexual.
- Homosexual behavior is generally accepted and integrated into the social fabric of the species, with little hostility or segregation.
- Instances of aggression towards homosexual individuals are rare and usually observed in males interfering with homosexual activity between females.
- Transgendered individuals may face aggression from nontransgendered members of their species in some cases.
- The observation of homosexual behavior in various animal species underscores its prevalence beyond just humans.
- Primates, including monkeys and apes, engage in same-sex activity and may display homosexual consortships.
- Homosexual pairs in some species may serve as "sentinels" or guards for the group.
- Some animal species exhibit cultural traditions related to sexuality, including homosexual activity.
- Sexuality in primates may have contributed to the development of significant cultural milestones considered defining characteristics of "humanness."
- Incest taboos have counterparts in some primate species, indicating that they are not solely due to instinct or genetic factors.
- Observations of ritualized homosexual activities in some animals may have influenced human rituals.
- The significance of animal sexuality lies in its complex interplay between biology, environment, culture, and social development.
- Animal homosexuality is part of the "natural history" of animals and extends beyond nonhuman primates to domesticated animals.
- Interpretations of animal homosexuality can be influenced by human beliefs and attitudes towards human homosexuality.
- Biased views have sometimes been held by biologists, reflecting societal attitudes rather than scientific objectivity.

## Two Hundred Years of Looking at Homosexual Wildlife
- Animal homosexuality has been observed and recorded since ancient times, with early accounts dating back to ancient Greece and Egypt.
- In the 18th century, naturalists like Buffon and Edwards made significant strides in the scientific study of animal homosexuality, particularly in birds.
- The field has expanded with nearly 600 scientific articles and publications exploring same-sex behavior in various species.
- However, the scientific study of animal homosexuality has faced biases, negative attitudes, and homophobia, mirroring the treatment of human homosexuality in society.
- Derogatory terms like "abnormal" and "perverse" have been used to describe animal homosexuality, and negative value judgments have been unjustly attached to same-sex activities.
- Researchers have subjected animals to extreme experimental treatments to study homosexuality, similar to misguided attempts to "cure" human homosexuality.
- Much scientific information on animal homosexuality remains inaccessible, and many popular works on animals omit any mention of same-sex behavior.
- The history of scientific attitudes toward animal homosexuality reflects the history of human attitudes, underscoring the role of culture and bias in shaping scientific discourse.
- Biased language and unwarranted assumptions have been used by some scientists when discussing homosexual behavior in animals.
- Animal homosexuality is often dismissed as abnormal or unnatural, with some researchers using terms like "mock courtship" or "sham mating" to describe same-sex interactions.
- Some researchers display a double standard by interpreting same-sex behavior negatively, while overlooking similar issues in opposite-sex pairs.
- Heterosexuality is often presumed as the default, leading researchers to ignore or misinterpret same-sex activity unless it is explicitly proven.
- Some scientists use euphemistic or neutral terms like "male-male" or "female-female" activity instead of "homosexual" to avoid connotations and stigma.
- Anthropomorphizing is more common in discussions of heterosexual behavior, while same-sex behavior is often viewed more critically and skeptically.
- Unbiased and comprehensive studies of animal behavior are needed to gain a full understanding of the diverse spectrum of sexual and social interactions in the animal kingdom.
- There is no single type of same-sex pair-bonding in humans or animals, and homosexual couples vary vastly in factors like sexual behavior, social status, formation process, sexual orientation, and parenting.
- The term "homosexual" should be used broadly to encompass behaviors like courtship, pair-bonding, and parenting activities between animals of the same sex.
- Homosexual activity is often marginalized or trivialized, while exhaustive coverage is given to heterosexual interactions, leading to distorted perceptions of its prevalence or significance.
- A double standard exists in evaluating the prevalence of heterosexual and homosexual behavior in animals, with some researchers reluctant to use the term "homosexual" and offering alternative interpretations or explanations for same-sex behavior.
- Homosexuality in animals is often overlooked or omitted in scientific literature, perpetuating misinformation and misconceptions about its occurrence.
- Researchers have attempted to explain same-sex behavior as non-sexual activities, such as "greeting," "reassurance," or "dominance" behavior, but dominance-based interpretations are often inadequate and inconsistent across species.
- The concept of dominance in animal behavior is complex and context-dependent and should not be overgeneralized or used as the sole explanation for homosexual behavior.
- Phenomena like leadership, attention-structure, social facilitation, and inhibition provide insights into primate social interaction.
- Competition and cooperation in social primates are intertwined rather than opposing forces, and both female and male primates play significant roles in alliance systems.
- Dominance analysis of animal homosexuality lacks broad evidence and has been refuted by later, more careful investigations of the phenomenon.
- The complex relationship between sexual and nonsexual aspects of behavior needs careful examination, and recognizing this complexity can lead to a more comprehensive understanding of animal life and sexuality.

## Explaining (Away) Animal Homosexuality
- August 1995: Symposium on sexual orientation in animals at the 24th International Ethological Conference recognized animal homosexuality as a legitimate field of study.
- Focus of the conference primarily on hormonal and neurological differences between male and female behaviors, perpetuating the view of homosexuality as gender "inversion" or "atypical" behavior.
- Zoologists with firsthand observations of homosexual behavior in the wild were overlooked, and the scientific discourse remained fixated on finding explanations, neglecting diversity and prevalence of same-sex activity in the animal kingdom.
- Flawed and outdated "explanations" for animal homosexuality proposed, including imitation of heterosexuality, substitute activity, mistake, and pathological condition.
- Pseudoheterosexual interpretation assumes same-sex interactions mimic heterosexual behaviors, but many species exhibit unique homosexual behaviors.
- Complex gender roles in same-sex interactions among animals are multidimensional and not easily classified as "homosexual" or "heterosexual" based on perceived gender roles.
- Genuine transgender behaviors can occur in same-sex interactions and heterosexual contexts, challenging simplistic categorizations.
- Homosexuality in animals not solely due to shortage of opposite-sex partners; occurs even when potential mates are available.
- Same-sex interactions often exhibit longevity and durability, resisting conversion attempts to heterosexuality.
- Correlation between environmental toxins and same-sex pairing in certain bird populations suggested, but the explanation has limited applicability and evidence.
- Sex misidentification not a widespread cause of homosexuality, as many species exhibit same-sex behavior despite clear visual differences between sexes.
- Homosexuality and transgender behavior observed in both wild and captive animals, challenging the assumption that they are solely a result of captivity.
- Hormonal imbalances and physical abnormalities suggested as potential explanations for homosexual behavior in animals, but little evidence supports these claims.
- Pathologizing of gender-atypical behavior and transgender animals based on arbitrary categorizations and biased conceptual categories.
- Prevalence of homosexuality and transgender behavior in various species, both in captivity and the wild, indicates they are long-standing and regular features of natural animal populations.
- Pathologizing of homosexuality and transgender behavior in animals rooted in the idea that they are dysfunctional due to their lack of contribution to reproduction.
- Nonbreeding animals, including transgender individuals, can be healthier as they avoid the physical stresses of the breeding season.
- The next chapter will explore complex interrelationships between procreation and homosexuality, bisexuality, transgender, and heterosexuality in the animal kingdom, challenging assumptions about the significance of reproduction in understanding animal behavior.

## Not for Breeding Only: Reproduction on the Periphery of Life
- Homosexuality and reproduction in animals intersect in unexpected and paradoxical ways.
- Some scientists suggest same-sex activity might play a role in reproduction or species survival, but positive explanations lack consistency across species.
- Hypotheses proposing homosexual animals act as "helpers" or regulate population growth have little supporting evidence.
- Bisexuality is prevalent in the animal kingdom, challenging traditional assumptions about reproduction and passing on genes.
- James A. Mills' study on Silver Gulls in New Zealand showed bisexual individuals had fewer successful breeders compared to heterosexual ones.
- Lower reproductive output of bisexual females independent of breeding with male or female partners.
- Correlation between bisexuality and breeding success not straightforward in many species; evidence limited and inconclusive.
- Homosexuality likely has a genetic component, but social, behavioral, and individual factors also play important roles.
- Evolutionary purpose of homosexual behavior in animals debated; "practice" explanation not widely accepted.
- Homosexual behavior not limited to younger or sexually inexperienced animals, challenging the "practice" interpretation.
- Homosexuality in animals may serve social functions or have cultural dimensions, particularly in complex social animals like primates.
- Various speculative and implausible explanations about the function of homosexuality proposed, often based on misconceptions.
- Many animals exhibit nonreproductive and alternative heterosexual behaviors, suggesting diverse sexual and social organization.
- Animals also display homosexual behaviors, indicating same-sex pairings are not unique to humans.
- Biology's "present ignorance" stems from a focus on finding reproductive explanations for diverse sexualities and genders in animals.
- The next chapter will explore how biology can reconcile with the existence and purposelessness of various behaviors, sexualities, and genders observed in the natural world.

## A New Paradigm: Biological Exuberance
- Homosexuality in animals viewed as abnormal by societies with negative attitudes towards homosexuality in humans.
- Western science focused on reproduction and faced challenges explaining animal homosexuality.
- Indigenous and tribal cultures recognize and accept multiple and mutable gender and sexuality in animals and humans.
- Concept of Biological Exuberance seeks to combine indigenous and modern perspectives on the natural world.
- Native American tribes honor and recognize homosexuality and transgender individuals as "two-spirit" people.
- Indigenous cultures worldwide have traditional beliefs about animal homosexuality and transgender, encoded in totemic associations, myths, and ceremonial practices.
- Ritual enactments of same-sex activity present in various Native American tribes, New Guinea, and Melanesia.
- Indigenous cultures perceive alternative systems of gender and sexuality in animals, associating them totemically or symbolically with homosexuality and transgender.
- Modern scientific observations confirm evidence of same-sex behavior and intersexuality in some animals, aligning with indigenous beliefs.
- Collaboration between indigenous knowledge and Western science leads to important discoveries and challenges traditional functional explanations based on evolution.
- Biological Exuberance combines post-Darwinian evolution, chaos theory, and biodiversity studies, celebrating the diversity and unpredictability of life on Earth.
- Indigenous cosmologies and scientific perspectives converge, recognizing the importance of indigenous knowledge in understanding biodiversity and ecological systems.
- Biological Exuberance offers a more inclusive and polysexual view of the natural world, embracing the complexity and richness of all living beings.
