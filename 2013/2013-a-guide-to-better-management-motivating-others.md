# A Guide to Better Management: Motivating Others
**Authors**: Jon Allen | **Year**: 2013

## Summary
This practical management guide explores how to motivate yourself and others using Neuro-Linguistic Programming (NLP) techniques. The book reveals that motivation is intrinsic—you can't force someone to be motivated, but you can help people discover what naturally drives them. By understanding different motivational patterns and applying Maslow's hierarchy of needs, managers can create environments where people find their own reasons to excel.

The book is perfect for managers, team leaders, and anyone who needs to inspire others to perform at their best. Readers will learn practical techniques for identifying individual motivational triggers, creating compelling reasons for action, and leading by example through authentic enthusiasm.

## Core Insights

### Understanding Motivational Patterns
People differ fundamentally in what drives them, and recognizing these patterns is key to effective motivation. The five main patterns are: moving toward positives vs. away from negatives, future-focused vs. past-referencing, preferring similarity vs. difference, self-referenced vs. other-referenced decision-making, and necessity-driven vs. possibility-driven motivation. By listening carefully to how people describe their experiences, you can identify their natural motivational style and tailor your approach accordingly.

> "Human beings are not billiard balls, you cannot just put a stick behind them and give a push and then have them motivated."

**Quick Take**: Notice whether someone says "I want to avoid problems" (away from) or "I want to achieve benefits" (toward), then frame your requests accordingly.

### Maslow's Hierarchy in Practice
Before attempting to motivate others, ensure their basic needs are met. People cannot focus on growth and potential when they're worried about physical comfort, safety, or belonging. This hierarchy explains why office environments matter, why job security affects performance, and why team bonding is essential before asking for discretionary effort.

> "If you have a physical need it completely shuts out most of the time your motivation to solving any other needs."

**Quick Take**: Check whether your team members are struggling with comfort, safety, or belonging issues before expecting peak performance.

### Self-Motivation Comes First
You cannot effectively motivate others if you don't understand your own motivation. The book emphasizes that managers must first master self-motivation techniques by identifying their personal patterns, learning from past successful motivation, and developing empowering self-talk. Your authentic enthusiasm becomes contagious and serves as your most powerful motivational tool.

> "You are probably the most motivational thing that there is for the rest of your staff."

**Quick Take**: Identify your most motivating self-talk phrases and use them deliberately when you need to generate enthusiasm.

### Values Alignment Matters
When motivation clashes with deeply held values or beliefs, no technique will work. People cannot sustain motivation for actions that violate their core principles. Rather than trying to override these beliefs, effective managers either work around them or help people find even more compelling values that support the desired behavior.

> "It's no good trying to push somebody into being motivated if it clashes with something they believe in."

**Quick Take**: Ask "What would make this worthwhile for you?" and listen for value-based concerns before implementing motivation strategies.

### Lead by Inspired Example
The most powerful motivation comes from observing others who are genuinely motivated themselves. When you authentically embody enthusiasm and commitment, people naturally gravitate toward that energy. This explains why some managers inspire effortlessly while others struggle with elaborate reward systems—genuine motivation is emotional, not logical.

> "Motivation is far more linked to our emotions than our logic. It's linked to a feeling rather than a careful thinking through."

**Quick Take**: Before motivating your team, ensure you've genuinely motivated yourself first—your authentic energy will be contagious.
