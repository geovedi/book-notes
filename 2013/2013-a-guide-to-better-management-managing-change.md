# A Guide to Better Management: Managing Change
**Authors**: Jon Allen | **Year**: 2013

## Summary
This practical guide reveals how to transform change from a source of resistance and anxiety into an opportunity for growth and improvement. Using principles from Neuro-Linguistic Programming (NLP), Allen presents a step-by-step approach to managing change effectively in both professional and personal contexts. The book emphasizes that change is natural and constant - our resistance to it is what we've learned culturally.

Managers and leaders will gain a complete framework for guiding themselves and others through transitions with minimal disruption and maximum benefit. The approach focuses on managing the emotional journey of change while empowering people to influence how change affects them personally and professionally.

## Core Insights

### The Emotional Change Process
Change follows a predictable emotional sequence that must be acknowledged, not suppressed. Understanding this process helps people move through resistance naturally rather than getting stuck in negativity.

The process begins with **mourning what will be lost** - allowing people to acknowledge the "good old days" and what they'll miss from current situations. This stage typically passes quickly when permitted. Next, people begin to **identify what won't be missed** about old ways, creating space for seeing benefits in the new approach. Then they move to **exploring potential gains** from the change, and finally they shift to **preparing for implementation** and making it work successfully.

> "The first stage of being able to manage change well is to convince yourself that change is actually something which brings benefits. It's good for us, it is useful for us, we have gained through it."

**Quick Take**: Don't fight the emotional journey of change - guide people through it systematically and they'll emerge more constructive and prepared.

### The Mindset Transformation
Our resistance to change is learned, while our ability to adapt is natural. The book demonstrates how to shift from viewing change as threatening to seeing it as opportunity.

Start by gathering evidence of times when change has brought benefits - both chosen changes (moving for better opportunities) and imposed changes (redundancies that led to better careers). Review your personal history with change to recognize the pattern of initial resistance followed by eventual benefit. Consciously focus on potential gains rather than potential losses when facing new changes.

> "Change is something that we were designed for. Our bodies change constantly, not just in the obvious physical way of growing up and growing older but also in the fact that our cells are constantly renewing themselves."

**Quick Take**: Change your relationship with change by systematically collecting evidence of its benefits and focusing on opportunities rather than threats.

### Strategic Choice and Control
Even when change is imposed, people can exercise significant control over how it's implemented and what additional benefits they gain from it. This sense of agency transforms resistance into collaboration.

Give people genuine choices about implementation details whenever possible. Ask what would make the transition easier for them personally and professionally. Encourage them to identify what skills they'd like to develop during the change process. The book provides numerous examples where allowing people to influence the implementation of organizational changes dramatically reduced resistance and increased commitment.

> "If you allow people to work out how change can be implemented well, you will find that they become far more committed to it and far more willing to undergo it."

**Quick Take**: Transform people from victims of change to active participants by giving them meaningful choices in how changes happen.

### Communication and Involvement
Keeping people informed throughout the change process is critical, even when there's no new information to share. The book emphasizes that speculation and rumors are far more damaging than honest communication about uncertainty.

Communicate at each stage: when you're considering change, exploring options, making decisions, implementing the transition, and even when progress stalls. Regular, honest communication reduces anxiety and prevents the grapevine from creating distorted narratives. Acknowledge when things are stuck or delayed rather than letting silence breed suspicion.

> "Rather than have that happen, keep people informed, tell them that you're thinking about making a change. Tell them that you're considering the options for the change."

**Quick Take**: Over-communicate during change - even sharing "no news today" prevents speculation and builds trust.

### The Change Agent Mindset
The ultimate goal is to become someone who actively seeks and creates change opportunities rather than just managing them reactively. This represents the highest level of change mastery.

Develop habits of constantly asking "what else could we do?" and "how else could we approach this?" Seek out new ideas and test them in safe, small-scale ways. Start seeing yourself as someone who experiments and learns from trying different approaches. Encourage others to share their ideas for improvement and make experimentation valued in your organization.

> "Being a change agent means someone who actively seeks it out, who is always looking for the opportunities to develop themselves and who thrives on any form of change."

**Quick Take**: Move from managing change to actively creating it by developing habits of experimentation and continuous improvement.

## Best Quotes

- "The one constant in the work place and in fact in society today, is change. And it isn't just change at a reasonable pace, the speed of change has increased considerably."

- "The people who are ready in that third category are the people who have learned to manage and enjoy change. In the world we live in, we all need to be in that third category."

- "Change is a simple process, and once we've acknowledge what that process is, and once we've recognised the things that help us to change our mind, it can become fun."

- "If you're not sure what's happening, it really helps if we're told the stages that are being gone through."

- "We all seem to have developed a resistance to change as if it's bound to be a bad thing. What we look for is a place to settle, we want to be able to say, 'ok, I've got that now, now can I just sit here with it for a little while and feel like I've reached the end'."

## Action Items

- **Review your change history**: List 3-5 major changes (chosen and imposed) and identify the benefits that eventually emerged from each

- **Practice the change process**: Apply the emotional change sequence to a current challenge, allowing yourself to move through each stage without resistance

- **Identify choice points**: When facing imposed change, list areas where you still have control or influence over implementation

- **Develop communication habits**: Create a plan for regular updates during any change you're managing, even when there's nothing new to report

- **Start small experiments**: Choose one routine or process and test a different approach to build your change agent muscles

- **Ask empowering questions**: Regularly ask "what else could we do?" and "how might this work better?" to encourage creative thinking

## Questions to Consider

- How has your resistance to change actually limited your growth and opportunities?

- What evidence from your past proves that change often leads to unexpected benefits?

- Where are you currently treating change as something that happens to you rather than something you can influence?

- How would you lead differently if you saw yourself as a change agent rather than a change manager?

- What small experiments could you run this week to develop your comfort with change?

## Conclusion

This book is worth your time if you're responsible for leading others through change or if you personally struggle with adapting to new circumstances. Allen provides a practical, psychologically sound framework that works because it acknowledges human nature rather than fighting it.

The biggest reason to read this is to transform your relationship with change from resistance to opportunity. The approach is immediately applicable and can help you lead both yourself and others through transitions with greater confidence and success. The book's strength lies in its recognition that effective change management is emotional, not just logical - and it gives you the tools to navigate that emotional landscape successfully.

While the concepts aren't revolutionary, their systematic presentation and practical application framework make this a valuable resource for anyone facing organizational change or personal transitions. The NLP foundation adds depth without complexity, making the insights accessible and actionable.
