# Historical Variability in Heritable General Intelligence
**Authors**: Michael A. Woodley, Aurelio José Figueredo | **Year**: 2013

## Summary
This controversial academic work examines how the genetic component of human intelligence has changed over the past 500 years and how these changes have impacted innovation and cultural development. The authors present evidence that Western societies experienced "eugenic fertility" from 1450-1850 (when higher-IQ individuals had more children), followed by "dysgenic fertility" from 1850-present (when lower-IQ individuals have higher fertility rates). Using statistical models, they demonstrate that declining heritable intelligence strongly predicts reduced rates of scientific and technological innovation, mediated through the shrinking proportion of highly intelligent individuals who drive breakthrough discoveries.

The book is essential reading for researchers, policymakers, and anyone interested in understanding the long-term relationship between intelligence, innovation, and cultural evolution. Readers will gain a sophisticated framework for understanding how genetic and cultural factors interact to shape societal progress and why innovation rates have been declining despite improvements in education and technology.

## Core Insights

### **1. The Historical Reversal of Intelligence Selection**
From 1450-1850, Western societies favored the reproduction of higher-IQ individuals through what the authors call "eugenic fertility." The wealthy and educated classes had higher survival and reproduction rates due to challenging environmental conditions during the Little Ice Age. After 1850, this pattern reversed dramatically - today, lower-IQ individuals have significantly higher fertility rates, creating a downward genetic trend in intelligence.

> "The differential fertility gradient in Western Industrial Societies, such as those of the British Isles, had been in favor of high IQ individuals...but reversed itself shortly thereafter."
**Quick Take**: The environmental conditions that historically favored intelligence have changed, leading to predictable genetic consequences.

### **2. Heritable Intelligence Drives Innovation, Not Test Scores**
The book demonstrates that increases in IQ test scores (the Flynn effect) are unrelated to major scientific innovations. Only the genetic component of general intelligence (g.h) predicts breakthrough discoveries. The Flynn effect reflects improved performance on specialized cognitive tasks, while true innovation requires the kind of "cognitive heavy lifting" that depends on innate intelligence.

> "The capacity of a society for significant innovation appears to be completely independent of the Flynn effect."
**Quick Take**: Educational improvements and test-taking skills don't create geniuses - genetic factors do.

### **3. The Smart Fraction Theory Confirmed**
Societies need a critical mass of very high-IQ individuals (IQ 140+) to generate major innovations. The authors found that declining heritable intelligence reduces this "smart fraction," which in turn mediates the relationship between genetic intelligence and innovation rates. Even small changes in average intelligence produce large changes in the number of geniuses.

> "Even though this suggests a lack of success in the mating market, failure to marry doesn't necessarily entail failure to reproduce...Ellis strikingly found that one out of five British geniuses were celibate."
**Quick Take**: Genius appears to be a group-selected trait that often costs individuals personally while benefiting society.

### **4. Innovation Decline Despite Better Conditions**
Contrary to theories that innovation is declining due to "low hanging fruit" or economic factors, the authors present evidence that the primary driver is reduced intelligence. Historical data shows that even when economic incentives were strong and patents were available, innovation flourished during periods of rising genetic intelligence and declined when intelligence fell.

> "The end result of this process is social improvement along performance-dimensions that are contingent upon increasing specialization...coupled with social 'regression' along performance-dimensions that are contingent upon cognitive 'heavy lifting'."
**Quick Take**: Better education and technology cannot compensate for reduced cognitive capacity at the population level.

### **5. Gene-Culture Coevolution Dynamics**
The authors propose a multilevel selection model where traits beneficial for group survival (like high intelligence) can be selected against at the individual level. During periods of intense between-group competition (like wars), group selection favors traits like genius and altruism even when they're personally costly. During peaceful periods, individual selection dominates, favoring different traits.

> "For the processes of within-group individual selection and between-group selection of social organisms are not merely potentially independent, producing different results, but especially in regard to such vital traits as superego strength and self-sacrificing tendencies systematically undoing each other."
**Quick Take**: The balance between individual and group-level selection determines whether societies evolve toward or away from intelligence.

### **6. Global Implications**
The dysgenic trend isn't limited to Western countries - it's a global phenomenon following the demographic transition. Additionally, differential population growth between high-IQ and lower-IQ nations creates another source of declining global intelligence, potentially explaining reduced worldwide innovation rates.

> "This process of IQ decline via differential inter-group expansion therefore likely compounded the IQ decline via intra-group dysgenesis."
**Quick Take**: The decline in intelligence represents a global challenge with implications for human progress.

### **7. Institutional Cultural Changes**
Scientific institutions have shifted from selecting for brilliance to selecting for conscientiousness and conformity. This "cultural dysgenesis" compounds genetic effects, as institutions increasingly value bureaucratic skills over innovative thinking, further reducing breakthrough discoveries.

> "Institutions will then tend to substitute the seeking of transcendent scientific truth with more arbitrarily defined criteria, such as the proliferation of bureaucracy: institutional growth for its own sake."
**Quick Take**: Cultural factors can amplify genetic trends, creating feedback loops that accelerate innovation decline.

## Action Items

- **For Researchers**: Focus on studying elementary cognitive tasks (like reaction time) that are immune to Flynn effects when measuring intelligence trends
- **For Educators**: Recognize that improved test scores don't necessarily indicate improved problem-solving capacity or innovation potential
- **For Policymakers**: Consider the long-term genetic consequences of education and family planning policies
- **For Institutions**: Re-evaluate hiring and promotion criteria to ensure they don't systematically exclude high-intelligence non-conformists
- **For Individuals**: Be aware that cognitive specialization and general intelligence represent different capabilities

## Questions to Consider

- If the authors are correct about declining intelligence, what does this mean for humanity's ability to solve complex future challenges like climate change or artificial intelligence?
- Should societies actively promote eugenic fertility patterns, or are there ethical ways to encourage higher reproduction rates among the intelligent?
- How can we redesign scientific institutions to select for genuine innovation rather than bureaucratic conformity?
- What role might genetic engineering or cognitive enhancement technologies play in reversing these trends?
- Is the decline in innovation necessarily negative, or might it represent a shift toward different kinds of progress?

## Conclusion

This challenging and controversial book presents a compelling case that the genetic component of human intelligence has been declining for over a century, with serious consequences for innovation and progress. While the authors acknowledge that they are describing rather than prescribing solutions, their findings demand attention from anyone concerned with the future of human civilization.

The book's greatest strength is its comprehensive integration of genetics, psychology, history, and evolutionary theory to explain the innovation decline that many researchers have documented but few have understood. Whether or not one agrees with all their conclusions, the authors provide a framework that makes sense of several puzzling historical trends.

This is essential reading for those willing to confront uncomfortable truths about the relationship between genetics, intelligence, and cultural progress. The implications are profound and will shape discussions about education, research funding, and demographic policy for decades to come. While some may find the conclusions disturbing, understanding these dynamics is crucial for anyone interested in ensuring human progress continues into the future.
