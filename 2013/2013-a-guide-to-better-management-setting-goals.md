# A Guide to Better Management: Setting Goals
**Authors**: Jon Allen | **Year**: 2013

## Summary
This practical management guide introduces Neuro-Linguistic Programming (NLP) principles to help managers and professionals master the art of setting and achieving meaningful goals. Based on the study of excellence, the book reveals how successful people across different fields share similar core beliefs and approaches that anyone can adopt to improve their performance and satisfaction.

Professionals at all levels who feel stuck in reactive work patterns will learn to transform goal-setting from a tedious exercise into a dynamic process that brings direction, purpose, and enjoyment to their work and personal lives. The book provides concrete techniques for moving from short-term firefighting to long-term vision.

## Core Framework: The Four Pillars of Effective Goal Setting

### 1. Vision and Mission Creation
**The Foundation**: Before setting any goals, you must understand your deeper purpose and create an inspiring vision. This isn't about practical constraints but about imagining your ideal situation without limitations.

The book emphasizes that we're "designed to develop, to grow and to move both literally and mentally." Without clear direction, we're like "a good sailor without having the ability to steer our ship." Your vision serves as the north star that guides all subsequent decisions and actions.

**Key Questions for Visioning**:
- What is your mission or purpose in life?
- If there were no practical constraints, how would you like your life to be?
- What would your ideal work situation look like?
- Where do you feel most fulfilled and happy?

> "If we only aim for the horizon, we may only reach just in front of our feet. So when you're setting up a vision it's important to set up the ideal of how you would like things to be."

**Quick Take**: Your vision should be ambitious enough to inspire you but personal enough to feel authentic. Take time to "try on" your vision mentally and adjust it until it fits perfectly.

### 2. Hierarchical Goal Structure
**The Russian Doll Principle**: Goals should nest inside each other, with life goals containing work goals, which contain long-term goals, which contain short-term goals. Each level provides context for the ones below it.

The book warns against common workplace goal-setting mistakes: "What it tends to mean in work is that you've been set a target to reach... This is a very limited definition of 'goal'." True goal-setting connects daily activities to lifetime aspirations.

**Structure Components**:
- **Lifetime Goals**: Your ultimate purpose and what you want to have achieved
- **Long-term Goals**: Where you want to be in 1-5+ years
- **Short-term Goals**: Immediate steps that move you toward long-term goals
- **Daily Actions**: Specific things you can do today

> "If we become someone who is good at setting goals and good at putting goals into the context of longer term goals, we will significantly change the way in which we perform at work."

**Quick Take**: Always check that short-term goals serve long-term goals, which in turn serve your life mission. This prevents drifting and ensures consistent progress.

### 3. Wisdom with Hindsight Technique
**Future-Pacing Success**: One of the most powerful techniques in the book is using "wisdom with hindsight beforehand." Instead of hoping you'll succeed, imagine you already have and identify what made the difference.

**The Process**:
1. Imagine yourself having successfully achieved your goal
2. From that future position, look back and ask:
   - What made the difference to achieving this easily?
   - What was my mental attitude?
   - What actions and behaviors helped most?
   - What resources and support were crucial?
3. Use those insights to guide your current actions

> "If you use your imagination, you can imagine yourself reaching the end of a particular goal... As you imagine yourself reaching the end of that goal successfully you stand there and ask yourself these questions..."

**Quick Take**: This technique creates self-fulfilling prophecies for success rather than failure, giving you unconscious momentum toward your goals.

### 4. Prioritization: Important vs. Urgent
**The Eisenhower Matrix Applied**: The book emphasizes that modern work life bombards us with urgent requests that may not be important. Your goals provide the filter to distinguish between the two.

**Priority Framework**:
- **Urgent & Important**: Do first (helps goals and satisfies others)
- **Important & Not Urgent**: Schedule and protect (moves toward goals)
- **Urgent & Not Important**: Delegate or decline
- **Neither**: Eliminate

> "When there are so many urgent things it's so easy to ignore things that are not urgent and yet many of those are important things that will help you towards your goal."

**Quick Take**: Make "importance" your primary criterion, not urgency. This requires courage to say no to urgent but goal-irrelevant requests.

## Best Quotes

- "We are actually alive, organic creatures, we are creatures who are designed to develop, to grow and to move both literally and mentally."

- "Remember that you are called a human 'being', not a human 'doing', it's an important reminder. As a human being some of your goals should involve how you will be and not just what you will do."

- "Using wisdom with hindsight automatically reminds you about the effect and the effect on others rather than just about the straightforward product or result that you want to achieve."

- "We're back to the Russian dolls again, the goals provide the context that allow us to make the choices about what actions we need to take most importantly rather than most urgently."

- "Setting goals can be a way of bringing our life really into something dynamic and exciting rather than something which just happens to us."

## Action Items

- **Tonight**: Write down your answers to "What would I do if there were no practical constraints?"
- **This Week**: Identify one important-but-not-urgent action that moves you toward your goals and schedule it
- **Next Week**: Practice the "wisdom with hindsight" technique with one current goal
- **Ongoing**: Create a daily morning ritual of setting one "do" goal and one "be" goal for the day

## Questions to Consider

- What would you attempt if you knew you couldn't fail?
- Which of your current urgent tasks are actually moving you toward your goals?
- How could your workplace relationships change if you focused on being rather than doing?
- What small adjustment to your current goals would make them fit you perfectly?
