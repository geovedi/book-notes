# Strategy: A History
**Author**: Lawrence Freedman | **Year**: 2013 | **Category**: Philosophy & Critical Thinking

## Summary
Strategy: A History is a sweeping intellectual journey through the evolution of strategic thinking from its biological and cultural origins to its modern applications in warfare, politics, and business. Freedman argues that strategy is fundamentally about "the art of creating power" – getting more out of a situation than the starting balance of power would suggest. The book traces how strategy has transformed from the art of warfare to become the essential approach for organizations and individuals navigating uncertainty and conflict.

This is not a practical "how-to" guide but rather a rich historical exploration that reveals how strategic thinking has developed across different domains and time periods. Freedman shows that strategy becomes necessary when others might frustrate our plans due to different interests and concerns, making it much more than simple planning. The book is essential reading for leaders, policymakers, business executives, and anyone who wants to understand the deeper patterns of human competition and cooperation that shape our world.

## Core Insights

### Strategy as the Art of Creating Power
Strategy is not merely about planning or optimization – it's about the fundamental political art of getting more out of situations than initial capabilities would suggest. Freedman argues that strategy "is the central political art" because it involves bargaining and persuasion as well as threats and pressure, psychological effects as well as physical ones, and words as well as deeds. Strategy comes into play when there's actual or potential conflict, when interests collide and forms of resolution are required. This distinguishes it from simple planning, which assumes a straightforward sequence of events. Strategy requires adapting to opponents' moves, chance events, and the inherent unpredictability of human affairs.

> "Strategy is the art of creating power."

**Quick Take**: True strategy isn't about having the biggest resources – it's about using those resources more creatively than opponents expect.

### From Military Origins to Universal Application
The word "strategy" only began to be used regularly in Britain, France, and Germany in the late 18th century, reflecting Enlightenment optimism that human affairs could benefit from reason. Before this, what we now call strategy was discussed as the "art of war." The book shows how business strategy references were rare before 1960 but took off during the 1970s, becoming more frequent than military strategy references by 2000. This migration of strategic thinking from military to civilian domains reflects broader trends of bureaucratization, professionalization, and the influence of social sciences in making organizations seem more manageable through systematic approaches.

> "Managers have always fancied themselves in the officer class."

**Quick Take**: The tools of strategy may have migrated from battlefield to boardroom, but the fundamental challenges of dealing with uncertainty and opposition remain the same.

### The Narrative Turn in Strategy
Freedman identifies a crucial shift in strategic thinking: the move from rigid planning to "strategic narratives" as the dominant contemporary approach. This reflects disillusionment with centralized planning and the recognition that strategies work through stories that give meaning to actions and persuade others to cooperate. The most effective strategies are compelling accounts of how to turn a developing situation into a desirable outcome. This narrative approach recognizes that strategy requires both System 1 intuitive understanding (mētis) and System 2 deliberate analysis to create stories that can guide action through uncertain circumstances.

> "Strategies are stories about the future, starting with imaginative fiction but with an aspiration to nonfiction."

**Quick Take**: Modern strategy succeeds not through perfect plans but through compelling narratives that align people's actions toward shared goals.

### Strategy as Script, Not Plan
One of the book's most powerful insights is the distinction between strategic plans and strategic scripts. While plans assume predictable cause-and-effect relationships that rarely survive contact with reality, scripts allow for improvisation and adaptation. Like drama, good strategic scripts have conflict, credible characters, sensitivity to chance, and room for unexpected developments. However, unlike dramatists who control all characters and events, strategists must cope with real opponents who write their own scripts. The most effective strategies are those that balance enough structure to provide direction with enough flexibility to adapt to reality's inevitable surprises.

> "Strategy really kicks in when there is something different and unfamiliar about the situation."

**Quick Take**: Treat your strategy like a movie script rather than a blueprint – provide direction but leave room for improvisation when reality intervenes.

### The Permanent Tension Between Cooperation and Conflict
Strategy exists in the space between complete consensus and complete control. Even as we compete against rivals, we must cooperate with allies and manage internal relationships. This interaction between cooperation and conflict is at the heart of all strategy. Freedman shows how the most astute strategic moves often involve building coalitions or preventing opponents from doing the same. The "pursuit of relative power is as much about subtracting and dividing as about adding and multiplying." This explains why compromise, negotiation, and accommodation are essential strategic tools, not signs of weakness.

> "The best way of coping with superior strength is often to put together a coalition or break up that of the opponent."

**Quick Take**: Strategic success often depends more on managing relationships than on direct confrontation.

## Best Quotes
- "Everyone has a plan 'till they get punched in the mouth." —Mike Tyson
- "Strategy is the art of creating power."
- "Strategy is meaningless without language and communication. Not only does strategy need to be put into words so that others can follow, but it works through affecting the behavior of others."
- "The picture of strategy that should emerge from this book is one that is fluid and flexible, governed by the starting point and not the end point."
- "For those who start as powerful, strategy should not be too difficult. The sensible application of superior resources tends to be successful... Underdog strategies, in situations where the starting balance of power would predict defeat, provide the real tests of creativity."

## Key Takeaways
- Strategy differs from planning because it anticipates opposition and requires adaptation to others' actions
- The most effective strategies are compelling narratives that align diverse actors toward common goals
- Modern strategic thinking has evolved from rigid planning to flexible scripts that accommodate uncertainty
- Strategy involves constant tension between cooperation with allies and conflict with opponents
- Underdog strategies provide the real tests of strategic creativity, as they require superior intelligence to overcome resource disadvantages

## Questions to Consider
- How much of your current "strategy" is actually just planning that assumes predictable outcomes?
- What narrative are you using to align your team or organization around common goals?
- Are you treating strategy as a rigid blueprint or as a flexible script that allows for improvisation?
- How do you balance the need for cooperation with allies against competition with opponents?
- What would your strategy look like if you assumed you had fewer resources than your opponents?

## Conclusion
Strategy: A History is an extraordinary achievement that transforms our understanding of human competition and cooperation. While the book is lengthy and densely packed with historical examples, its core message is profound: strategy is not about finding perfect solutions but about developing the wisdom to navigate uncertainty and the creativity to transform disadvantage into advantage. Freedman shows that the most effective strategists throughout history have been those who combined analytical rigor with narrative power, who could both diagnose complex situations and inspire others to action through compelling stories.

This is emphatically worth your time if you want to understand the deeper patterns that shape human affairs. The biggest reason to read it is that it will fundamentally change how you think about power, competition, and influence. After reading Freedman, you'll never see strategy the same way again – you'll recognize it not as a technical discipline but as the essential art of human agency in an uncertain world. The book's ultimate lesson is that strategy succeeds not through controlling circumstances but through shaping the stories that guide how others respond to them.
