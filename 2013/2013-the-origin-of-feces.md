# The Origin of Feces
**David Waltner-Toews** | **Year**: 2013

## Summary
This provocative book reveals how excrement—far from being merely waste—is fundamental to life on Earth. Through engaging stories from African safaris to modern sewage systems, Waltner-Toews demonstrates that shit connects ecology, culture, health, and sustainability in ways we rarely consider. The book argues that our modern "wicked problem" with excrement stems from breaking natural nutrient cycles and creating cultural taboos that prevent us from seeing excrement's vital ecological role.

Perfect for environmentalists, public health professionals, and anyone interested in sustainability, this book will transform how you see waste, ecology, and your place in natural cycles. You'll gain practical insights into sustainable living and a new appreciation for nature's recycling systems.

## Core Insights

### The Dung Beetle Solution
Dung beetles are nature's master recyclers, turning what we consider waste into essential ecological services. These remarkable insects close nutrient loops, enhance soil fertility, control parasites, and disperse seeds—contributing hundreds of millions of dollars in agricultural value globally. Some species can pull over 1,000 times their body weight, all to bury and process feces that nourishes ecosystems.

> "Every day, all around the world, by eating or burying what others consider waste, dung beetles turn water into wine, contaminated refuse into livable landscapes. They are the Rumpelstiltskins of the animal world, weaving gold from dung-straw."

**Quick Take**: Nature has already solved sustainable waste management—we just need to pay attention.

### Excrement as a "Wicked Problem"
Modern society treats excrement as a technical problem to be solved rather than a natural process to be integrated. Wicked problems are poorly bounded, contradictory, with incomplete information and solutions that create new problems. Our inability to even discuss shit comfortably (cultural taboos + technical jargon = communication breakdown) prevents us from finding sustainable solutions.

**Quick Take**: We can't engineer our way out of ecological problems we've created by breaking natural cycles.

### The Language Barrier
The book explores how our inability to talk about shit reflects deeper cultural-scientific divides. With dozens of terms—excrement, manure, biosolids, scat, ordure, frass—we've created linguistic barriers that separate popular understanding from scientific expertise. This communication gap prevents integrated solutions to waste management.

> "Before one can tell a story, one must have words. With words come culture, and with culture come taboos and conflicts, things we don't talk about, and don't talk about not talking about."

**Quick Take**: How we name things shapes how we think about them—and how we can solve problems.

### Nutrient Cycles and Sustainability
Pre-industrial societies understood what we've forgotten: excrement is valuable fertilizer that maintains soil fertility. Modern agriculture breaks these cycles, concentrating nutrients in pollution-causing pools while depleting soils elsewhere. The book reveals how sustainable systems require returning nutrients to their sources.

**Quick Take**: In nature, there's no such thing as waste—only resources in the wrong place.

### Health and Ecology Connections
The book connects personal health to ecosystem health through the lens of excrement. Public health approaches that view shit only as contamination miss its ecological benefits. Conversely, purely ecological solutions may ignore real health risks. Sustainable approaches must integrate both perspectives.

**Quick Take**: Personal health and environmental health are two sides of the same coin.

## Best Quotes
- "Shit is what sociologists and scientists call a wicked problem."
- "They close the feedback loops of nutrients and energy that are essential for the resilience and health of the ecosystems that are our home."
- "If we cannot name 'what from the tongue falls,' how can we possibly, seriously, address all the other dimensions of excrement?"
- "The way we treat excrement is a choice that feeds certain species and steals from others, destroys certain ecosystems and builds up others."

## Action Items
- **Learn from nature**: Study how natural systems recycle "waste" into resources
- **Break taboos**: Have open conversations about waste and sustainability
- **Support closed-loop systems**: Choose products and support businesses that recycle nutrients
- **Think systemically**: Consider how individual health connects to environmental health
- **Value diversity**: Recognize that different perspectives (cultural, scientific, ecological) all contribute to solutions

## Questions to Consider
- How would our cities change if we treated excrement as resource rather than waste?
- What cultural taboos prevent us from creating sustainable waste systems?
- How can we reconnect urban populations with natural nutrient cycles?
- What would a truly integrated health-ecology approach to waste management look like?

## Conclusion
This is absolutely worth your time if you're interested in environmental sustainability, public health, or understanding how natural systems work. Waltner-Toews uses humor, fascinating stories, and scientific insight to transform a taboo subject into a profound meditation on humanity's place in natural cycles. The biggest reason to read it? You'll never look at waste the same way again—and that's exactly the point. By understanding what we throw away, we might just save ourselves from drowning in it.
