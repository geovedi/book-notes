# The Design of Everyday Things
Don Norman

## The Psychopathology of Everyday Things
- Donald Norman explores the relationship between human psychology and everyday objects
- Modern devices can be frustrating and confusing due to their complexity
- The more functions a product has, the harder it is for users to learn and operate it effectively
- Human-centered design focuses on meeting the needs and mental models of users
- Affordances, constraints, and signifiers are important principles in human-centered design
- The system image, derived from the product's physical structure and documentation, is crucial for successful product usage
- The integration of technology brings both potential enhancements and challenges to design
- Collaboration between designers, engineers, marketers, manufacturers, and service providers is essential for creating successful products.

## The Psychology of Everyday Actions
- Ultimate goal of design: user-centered products and systems
- Design principles: discoverability, feedback, conceptual model, affordances, signifiers, mappings, and constraints
- Discoverability: clear actions and system state
- Feedback: informs users of actions and system status
- Conceptual model: mental map for understanding technology and making informed decisions
- Affordances and signifiers: communicate possible actions
- Mappings: logical relationships between controls and actions
- Constraints: guide users towards desired outcomes
- Designers empathize with users and consider their perspectives
- Continuous improvement and learning from failures
- Design empowers and provides understanding to users
- Designers responsible for user-centered systems
- Designers shape technology for positive impact on users' lives.

## Knowledge in the Head and in the World
- Nat mappings align controls & info w/ relationships, improving usability
- Lack of clear mappings in kitchen stove design = confusion/errors
- Nat mappings important in aviation, consider pilot viewpoint/mental models for safety/efficiency
- Cultural nuances impact design choices/perceptions of nat mappings, incl. time representation
- Designers create products/systems for diverse backgrounds/perspectives, consider metaphor choices/cultural lenses
- Switching metaphors or conventions = confusion/resistance, require adaptation periods
- Understanding cultural influences essential in creating tech that transcends borders/bridges cultures, harmonious coexistence w/ human experience.

## Knowing What to Do: Constraints Discoverability, and Feedback
- Destination-control elevators revolutionized vertical transportation with hallway keypads for efficiency.
- Resistance to objectively superior conventions is common.
- Metric system: logical, easy to learn, but faces resistance in some countries due to disruption and cost.
- Water faucet design: balancing user needs with physical structure.
- Sound in design: crucial for safety, e.g., artificial sounds in electric vehicles.
- Design challenges persist in an ever-evolving world, with innovation opportunities in efficiency, safety, and user satisfaction.

## Human Error? No, Bad Design
- Human error oversimplifies accident causes; Swiss cheese model shows how defense holes align, allowing errors. 
- Design redundancy prevents system failure; proper design reduces Swiss cheese holes for error detection. 
- Blaming individuals not constructive; focus on systemic issues for error understanding. 
- Resilience engineering designs effective responses to problems. 
- Automation enhances efficiency and safety, but leads to complacency. 
- Designing for error improves system; don't blame individuals. 
- Understanding human error requires acknowledging interconnected factors. 
- Redundancy, resilience, and design create safer systems.

## Design Thinking
- Design Thinking puts human needs and experiences at the forefront of problem-solving
- Requires empathy, creativity, and collaboration to arrive at innovative solutions
- Focuses on understanding the unique needs of individuals
- Structured yet flexible process with iterative ideation and prototyping
- Testing prototypes with real users for feedback and refinement
- Affordances create intuitive interactions in design
- Error prevention and tolerance enhance user satisfaction
- Design Thinking extends to digital interfaces, services, and systems
- Challenges include balancing usability and security, and not compromising on intended purpose
- Demands creativity, empathy, and willingness to embrace ambiguity
- Bridging the gap between technology and people for meaningful impact.

## Design in the World of Business
- Designing successful products involves meeting various needs and delivering emotional satisfaction to users
- Designers need a combination of technical skills, business acumen, and social finesse
- Sustainability is crucial in minimizing environmental impact and promoting responsible consumption
- Small innovations empower individuals and small groups to share their ideas and products globally
- User-centric design is essential for success, focusing on usability and user feedback
- Certain design principles remain constant despite technological advancements
- Designers must prioritize ethical considerations and create products with a positive impact
- Users can influence product development through feedback and support
- Design must align with timeless principles of human behavior and interaction
- The world of design offers exciting challenges and opportunities for creativity and talent.
