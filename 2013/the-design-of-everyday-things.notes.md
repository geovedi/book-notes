## The Psychopathology OF Everyday Things
- Conceptual Models and Design Principles:
  - Conceptual models are mental representations of how things work, formed through experience, training, and instruction.
  - Designers create conceptual models to guide users' understanding of products and devices.
  - A good conceptual model is crucial for predictability, usability, and problem-solving.
  - Users' mental models are derived from the system image, including physical structure, documentation, instructions, and online information.
  - Communication between designer, user, and system image is vital for successful design.
  - The paradox of technology: Technology simplifies and complicates life by adding functions and complexities to devices.
  - Great design requires cooperation between various disciplines, considering usability, aesthetics, affordability, manufacturing, and more.
- Importance of Conceptual Models:
  - Conceptual models guide users in predicting and understanding product behavior.
  - Designers' and users' mental models may not align due to lack of direct communication.
  - Inadequate or misleading conceptual models lead to difficulties in using products.
  - Effective conceptual models rely on clear signifiers, affordances, constraints, and mappings.
- Design Challenges and Solutions:
  - Successful design requires coordination among various disciplines, including marketing, engineering, manufacturing, and support.
  - Balancing competing priorities of price, usability, appearance, reliability, and more is essential.
  - Design teams must consider users' changing needs from store to home and the viewpoints of all stakeholders.
  - Human-centered design principles lead to positive results and user satisfaction.

## The Psychology OF Everyday Actions
- Blaming Oneself for Failures and Misunderstandings:
  - People often blame themselves for failures and difficulties when using technology or everyday objects.
  - This blame arises from a learned helplessness, where repeated failures lead to a belief in one's inability.
  - The phenomenon of learned helplessness can also contribute to technology and mathematics phobias.
- Importance of Design in Human-Machine Interaction:
  - Design plays a crucial role in how people interact with technology and machines.
  - A faulty conceptual model can lead to misunderstandings and errors in usage.
  - Positive design principles, such as affordances, mappings, feedback, and constraints, enhance user experience.
  - Designers should consider human behavior, flexibility, and creativity when creating products.
- Seven Stages of Action and Design Principles:
  - The seven stages of action (goal, plan, specify, perform, perceive, interpret, compare) provide insights into human interactions with systems.
  - Key design principles include discoverability, feedback, conceptual model, affordances, signifiers, mappings, and constraints.
  - Good design should ensure ease of use, clear feedback, and a strong conceptual model for users to understand and control systems.
- Avoiding Blame and Promoting Improvement:
  - Instead of blaming individuals, focus on identifying design deficiencies and communication breakdowns.
  - Recognize that different stages and groups may contribute to design problems.
  - Seek to understand the causes of design flaws and propose alternative solutions.
  - Appreciating good design helps in recognizing the mastery of the seven stages of action and design principles.
- Complex Systems and Holistic Design:
  - Interactions with products involve complex systems where design influences all stages of action.
  - A well-designed product considers users' requirements, intentions, and desires across all stages of interaction.

## Knowledge in The Head And in The World
- Knowledge in the head vs. knowledge in the world:
  - Knowledge in the head is efficient, readily available, but requires storage and retrieval.
  - Knowledge in the world is easily accessible but may be more difficult to use and can be lost due to changes in the environment.
  - Tradeoffs involve interpretation, learning, and ease of use.
- Memory and technology:
  - External knowledge sources (world, friends, technology) enhance intelligence but can be erroneous.
  - Technology and people combined create powerful capabilities.
  - Dependence on technology is increasing, impacting various aspects of life.
- Natural mapping:
  - Natural mappings enhance usability, where controls relate directly to the object being controlled.
  - Poor mappings lead to errors, burdening memory and increasing effort.
  - Examples include stove controls and gesture-controlled devices.
- Culture and design:
  - Natural mappings vary with culture and perspective.
  - Different cultures perceive time, direction, and spatial relationships differently.
  - Design choices should consider cultural perspectives and metaphors.
- Switching conventions and metaphors:
  - Switching conventions or metaphors can lead to confusion.
  - Adapting to new systems takes time and effort.

## Knowing What to Do: Constraints, Discoverability, And Feedback
- Elevator Destination Control:
  - Destination control optimizes elevator efficiency.
  - Keypads are located outside elevators to input desired floors.
  - Passengers are assigned to the most efficient elevator for their destination.
  - Provides faster trips and fewer stops, even with different floors.
  - Change of destination can be made at the control box in the elevator hall.
- Resistance to Change in Conventions:
  - People resist new approaches introduced to existing systems.
  - The metric system's benefits over English units are ignored by some countries.
  - The United States resists metric system adoption due to change difficulty.
  - Consistency in design is valuable, even if changes are slightly better.
  - Change is necessary for improvement, old conventions shouldn't hinder.
- Faucet Design Challenges:
  - Designing faucets for usability and consistency is complex.
  - Various control schemes: dual control for hot/cold, temperature-only control, etc.
  - Mapping problems arise from controls' interactions.
  - Cultural conventions, like left/hot and right/cold, influence faucet design.
  - Standardization simplifies design and user experience, but can hinder innovation.
- Using Sound as Signifiers:
  - Sound provides information where visibility is limited.
  - Natural sounds are informative about interactions and conditions.
  - Artificial sounds in cars help alert pedestrians due to quiet electric vehicles.
  - Sound should indicate presence, orientation, and speed without annoyance.
  - Balancing standardization and individualization for safety and branding.
  - Electric cars' quietness prompts efforts to add artificial sounds.
- Regulation for Electric Vehicle Sounds:
  - Electric vehicles' silence poses risks for pedestrians, especially the blind.
  - Regulations and standards are developed to ensure safe electric vehicle sounds.
  - Criteria for electric vehicle sounds: alertness, orientation, lack of annoyance.
  - The challenge is to alert and orient without causing annoyance.
  - Balancing standardization for interpretation and individualization for tracking/branding.
  - The effort to add sound contrasts with past efforts to make cars quieter.

## Human Error? No, Bad Design
- Swiss Cheese Model of Accidents:
  - Accidents result from multiple failures lining up.
  - Human error is just one layer; systemic flaws are more significant.
  - Mitigation involves reducing holes, improving design, redundancy, and layers of defense.
  - Shift from blaming individuals to focusing on system improvement.
- Role of Human Error and Design:
  - Not all accidents are due to human error; bad design plays a substantial role.
  - Competent individuals can err under conditions like fatigue, lack of training, etc.
  - Deliberate violations of procedures also contribute to accidents.
  - Proper design and training can significantly reduce accidents.
- Resilience Engineering:
  - Complex systems (e.g., oil refineries, power systems) require resilience.
  - Resilience engineering aims for systems that respond well to problems.
  - Constant assessment, testing, and improvement of systems, procedures, and communication.
  - Major providers deliberately cause errors to test and improve system responses.
- Paradox of Automation:
  - Automation reduces errors and increases efficiency in routine tasks.
  - Automation can fail unexpectedly in complex situations.
  - Automation can lead to complacency and reduced human vigilance.
  - Paradox: Automation is great for routine but fails in complex situations.
- Design Principles for Dealing with Error:
  - Collaborative approach: leverage human strengths and machine capabilities.
  - Minimize opportunities for errors and reduce their consequences.
  - Distribute operational knowledge between experts and non-experts.
  - Use natural constraints, visible feedback, and clear mappings in design.
  - Embrace error, understand causes, and focus on assistance and improvement.

## Design Thinking
- Challenges and Benefits of Standardization:
  - Standardization simplifies and harmonizes different systems.
  - Timing standards illustrate the need for careful standardization.
  - Standardize too soon or too late can lead to inefficiencies or high costs.
  - The metric system as an example of standardization struggles.
- Decimal Time and Metric Divisions:
  - Current time division is arbitrary with 12-hour cycles.
  - Proposal for metric time with digital hours, minutes, and seconds.
  - Benefits of decimal time: simplicity and compatibility with decimal arithmetic.
  - Historical attempts at introducing decimal time, including Swatch's effort.
- Balancing Design and Security:
  - Balancing usability with secrecy, privacy, or protection.
  - Deliberately making things difficult for security purposes.
  - Examples of deliberately difficult designs: security systems, dangerous equipment.
  - Importance of understanding rules of good design even for difficult tasks.
- Design Challenges and Safety:
  - Design's integration of technology, people, business, and culture.
  - Complex constraints and challenges for designers.
  - Constant consideration of products' usability by people.
  - Balancing safety features with potential secondary dangers.
