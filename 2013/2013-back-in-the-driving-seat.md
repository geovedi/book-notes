## Core Insights

### Embrace Radical Honesty and Share Your Story
Mordaunt discovered that breaking the silence around business failure was liberating and opened doors to solutions. His transparency about his €17 million debt and business struggles not only helped his own recovery but inspired thousands of others facing similar crises.

> "Don't be afraid to share your story. Talking to somebody can sometimes lead you to taking the first steps needed to begin recovery."

**Quick Take**: Vulnerability becomes strength when facing business crisis - your story can become both your salvation and others' inspiration.

### Ask "What Are You Prepared to Do?"
Inspired by a scene from "The Untouchables," Mordaunt learned that surviving business collapse requires ruthless honesty about how far you're willing to go to save yourself and your family. This meant making decisions that would have been unthinkable during good times.

> "I had reached the point where I had accepted that nobody would or could save my career except myself, and so emotion and sentimentality had to be removed from the process."

**Quick Take**: Survival means being willing to make the tough calls that business-as-usual mindset would never allow.

### Create Your Own Chapter 11 Recovery
Since Irish businesses didn't have access to US-style Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection, Mordaunt created his own "Plan B" - systematically dismantling the old business structure while simultaneously building a new, leaner operation free from legacy costs and obligations.

The six-step recovery process included:
1. Place all non-essential assets on the market
2. Redirect rental income to save family home
3. Proactively engage banks with exit strategies
4. Create new company structure
5. Prepare detailed statements of affairs
6. Build new business model from experience gained

**Quick Take**: When formal recovery systems don't exist, create your own structured approach to business resurrection.

### Make Decisive Strategic Cuts
Mordaunt identified that his car dealership franchises were costing more than they generated, leading to the painful decision to resign from Nissan, Kia, and Chevrolet partnerships his father had built over 20+ years.

> "Being decisive. Instead of stocking new Kias or Chevrolets, which only attracted fans of those brands, we decided to stock a range of sought-after used cars at prices that were competitive."

**Quick Take**: Sometimes the most respected aspects of your business are the very things weighing it down.

### Negotiate From Position of Reality
Rather than hiding from banks, Mordaunt learned to approach them with realistic proposals based on market truths. For his business premises mortgage, he proposed managing the building for the bank and paying market rent - saving both parties costs while keeping his business operational.

**Quick Take**: Banks prefer realistic solutions over fantasy promises - approach them with practical win-win proposals.
