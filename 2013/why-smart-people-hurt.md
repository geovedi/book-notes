# Why Smart People Hurt

Eric Maisel (2013)

## The Challenges of Smart

Natural psychology recognises meaning in three facets: as a deeply personal, subjective psychological experience; as a specific type of idea we construct; and as an individual evaluation of life that we maintain. This understanding emphasises the dynamic nature of meaning - it's not static or absolute but evolves with our personal experiences, ideas, and evaluations.

One of the transformative moments in a person's life comes when they shift from passively seeking meaning to actively making it. This change signifies a move from a position of dependence to one of agency, where we play an integral role in creating our life's purpose and significance.

However, this creation of meaning isn't a chaotic or random process. The approach that proves most beneficial and fulfilling is value-based meaning-making. This involves aligning our actions, decisions, and goals with our core values and beliefs, fostering a sense of authenticity and coherence in our life. This type of meaning-making is a cornerstone for emotional well-being and personal satisfaction as our lives reflect our deeply-held values.

Intelligent individuals, with their tendency for deep introspection and analysis, often grapple with understanding and creating meaning in their lives. Natural psychology suggests that the most effective response to this challenge is to embrace the role of a meaning-maker, engaging in value-based meaning-making. The idea is to create your life's narrative that resonates with your values and beliefs.

This journey might differ for everyone, with paths varying based on personal experiences, values, and aspirations. However, the challenge remains consistent - making sense of meaning, constructing it rather than searching for it. By adopting this proactive stance, one can better navigate the complexities of life, imbuing it with purpose, satisfaction, and emotional richness.

Intelligence does not inherently predispose one to meaningful crises. However, highly intelligent or intellectual individuals may grapple with existential questions or engage in critical self-reflection more frequently. These activities can lead to what you're calling a meaning crisis. So, it's not necessarily intelligence at risk but a specific type of reflective or philosophically-inclined intelligence.

Value-based meaning-making suggests creating significance or purpose based on deeply held values. We find meaning in life and our activities when they align with our core beliefs, ideals, and principles. This form of meaning-making can be fulfilling because it resonates with our intrinsic identity and personal truth.

Creating meaning in life is a deeply personal endeavour. It requires self-reflection and understanding one's values, interests, and passions. Here are a few things that might help:

   - Purpose: Identify and pursue a purpose larger than yourself, allowing you to contribute positively to the world around you.

   - Relationships: Cultivate deep, meaningful relationships. Interpersonal connections often provide a deep sense of purpose and meaning.

   - Growth: Continue to learn and grow personally and professionally. This exploration, over time, contributes to a deeper understanding of self and the world, leading to a richer sense of meaning.

   - Resilience: Learn to embrace challenges and change as opportunities for growth. Every difficulty is an opportunity to redefine and understand ourselves better.

The concept of self-created meaning can be empowering during a meaning crisis. If you believe you can create meaning, then a meaning crisis, while challenging, is also an opportunity for growth. It means you can reassess, redefine, and refocus your life based on your evolving values, beliefs, and experiences. This approach promotes resilience and adaptability, which are essential for dealing with life's uncertainties and fluctuations. Meaning crises become periods of transformation, leading to a deeper understanding of oneself and one's place in the world.

## Smartness Disparaged

A limited number of personality theories, primarily those influenced by Marxist economic ideas, acknowledge the significant impact of environmental circumstances on personality development and expression. These environmental factors may create barriers, discouraging the exploration and utilisation of individual intellectual capabilities. Such stifling negativity can be particularly damaging. For instance, when an intellectually gifted individual is raised in an environment that suppresses intellectual curiosity, the result is often emotional and psychological distress.

The societal and environmental pressures to conform often discourage free thinking and intellectual exploration, an experience that can be highly distressing. This external pressure can lead to internal conflict and psychological pain as individuals feel they are being denied the opportunity to utilise their cognitive abilities fully. This suppression can manifest in psychological issues, from anxiety related to specific tasks like mathematics to more generalised mental health issues like depression.

If a person's natural propensity towards intellectual engagement has been squashed, one of their primary tasks towards healing and personal development would be to renegotiate their relationship with their cognitive abilities. Utilising the inherent characteristics of their personality, they can strive to cultivate a healthier, more supportive connection with their intellect.

Intellectually inclined individuals possess an innate drive to think, a necessity to engage in cognitive exercises, and an ability to excel in such endeavours. However, the prevailing structures and norms in families, schools, workplaces, and society often stifle this intellectual flame. The behavioural patterns and attitudes of those around them can further fuel this suppression, hindering their potential for academic growth.

Recognising this, it becomes crucial to challenge these constraining norms, advocating for environments that encourage intellectual curiosity and cognitive exploration. While not easy, this approach is essential for nurturing academic potential and promoting overall mental and emotional well-being.

## Smart Work as Oxymoron

Given the opportunity, intelligent individuals will often find themselves confronted with a conventional range of career choices. There is, however, a significant disconnect between the societal perception of a profession's value and its intrinsic meaningfulness to an individual. The societal value of a job often hinges on external factors such as income, prestige, or social impact. At the same time, individuals' perception of meaningfulness is profoundly personal and influenced by their passions, interests, and values.

The challenges intellectually gifted individuals encounter when navigating the world of work are multi-faceted. Finding meaningful employment can be a struggle, particularly in a society that may not always value intellectual pursuits outside a specific high-earning, high-status subset. These individuals may often be immersed in repetitive, uninspiring work, potentially leading to dissatisfaction, frustration, and unfulfillment.

Moreover, they risk being boxed into a narrow specialisation within their chosen profession. While discipline can offer depth, it can also become suffocating for intellectually curious individuals who thrive on exploration, learning, and variety.

A common predicament is the choice between financially rewarding and intellectually stimulating work. While society often places a higher value on jobs with significant monetary rewards, these roles might only sometimes align with the individual's interests, leading to a conflict between societal expectations and personal fulfilment.

These challenges are not just about finding a suitable job but about adapting intellectual capabilities to social and professional structures that may only sometimes accommodate or appreciate intellectual diversity. Navigating this landscape requires a delicate balance of personal fulfilment, societal expectations, and practical needs.

Indeed, these challenges are so extensive and complex that they could fill an entire book. Such a book would need to explore the problems themselves and potential solutions and strategies for intelligent individuals to find meaningful work and adapt to society's configurations without sacrificing their intellectual curiosity and personal satisfaction.

## Original, Formed, and Available Personalities

Everyone is born with a unique blend of traits, abilities, tendencies, genetic attributes, temperament, and many other qualities. In natural psychology, this unique blend is called the "original personality." This original personality forms the initial template of who we are, shaping our innate potential and influencing how we perceive and interact with the world.

An intellectually gifted person, for example, is born with this innate intelligence. This intellectual propensity, part of their original personality, is a fundamental aspect of their initial identity.

However, the original personality does not exist in a vacuum; it interacts with the environment, shaping and being shaped by it. A child looks out at the world through the lens of their original personality and interacts with it accordingly. This interaction is a two-way street; the earth also responds, imprinting on the child's evolving self.

These external influences, experiences, and environmental factors significantly alter the child's developmental blueprint, forming the "formed personality." This developed personality is a product of the dynamic interplay between the original nature and living circumstances.

Thus, the individual's journey from birth onwards is a complex process of transformation and adaptation, where the original personality, through interactions with the environment and lived experiences, evolves into the formed personality. This journey, shaped by both intrinsic qualities and extrinsic influences, underscores the rich complexity of human development and personality formation.

## Our Experimental Model

As products of nature, human beings emerge from a process that doesn't strive for perfection but for adaptation and survival. Perfection is a human construct, an ideal that doesn't align with the mechanisms of evolution. In the natural world, the aim isn't flawless performance but relatively successful functionality within a given environment or context.

Given this evolutionary framework, it's reasonable to anticipate that complex, powerful, and somewhat chaotic faculty-like thinking would come with significant challenges and repercussions. With its immense potential and variability, thinking is not a precise tool but a product of an evolutionary process favouring adaptability over perfection.

Often, we operate under the assumption that our brains are perfectly equipped to handle life's myriad challenges. We burden our cognitive faculties with complex questions and challenges, some of which may extend beyond their evolutionary capacities. It's essential to recognise that the human brain has evolved over millions of years to address survival and reproductive needs, not to solve abstract philosophical problems or comprehend the intricacies of advanced theoretical physics.

Understanding that we are products of evolution, not design, is crucial. Our brains were not 'designed' with a blueprint for perfection but rather 'evolved' through natural selection, favouring traits beneficial for survival and reproduction. Recognising this can provide a humbling perspective on our limitations and an appreciation for our cognitive capacities, leading us to respect the complexities and challenges of thinking as integral parts of our evolutionary heritage.

## The Logic of Mania

The highly intellectual mind can be likened to a high-performance engine or a high-strung stallion – powerful, agile, and sometimes difficult to control. One of the challenges that this heightened cognitive capability can precipitate is a state akin to mania. This condition is not exclusive to knowledgeable individuals; it can affect anyone, induced by various factors, including drugs or the unregulated momentum of one's hyperactive, demanding mind. There's documented research demonstrating a connection between achieving high academic performance and susceptibility to bipolar disorder, a mental health condition characterised by extreme mood swings, including episodes of mania.

In this context, mania could be described as a mind racing uncontrollably, propelled by an intense inner pressure, need, or impulse. Any disruption to this forward momentum – a physical obstruction, differing opinions, or even a simple delay – can be perceived as a colossal annoyance. This frustration and intolerance for disruptions are expected in manic states.

Intelligent individuals often fail to recognise that their adopted states of forced calmness or hyperactivity may not be genuine lifestyle preferences but defensive mechanisms against the onset of manic episodes. They may cultivate an unnatural calm or engage in relentless activity, not necessarily because they enjoy these states but to prevent their minds from spiralling into uncontrolled mania.

Consequently, highly intelligent individuals confront two interconnected threats. The first is the strain of maintaining an artificial calm, which can feel like self-imposed boredom and confinement. The second threat is the risk of uncontrolled mania, which can be distressing during the experience. It often culminates in despair when the individual realises their frantic efforts did not alter their fundamental life circumstances.

These threats reflect the challenging dynamics individuals with high cognitive capabilities often face. Understanding these challenges is the first step towards managing them effectively, promoting mental health, and ensuring that intellectual potential is harnessed healthily and productively.

## Features of a Racing Brain

Our brains are inherently exploratory, always seeking, questioning, and analysing. This tendency makes it difficult for our minds to quiet down, even when we desperately need rest. As we lie in bed, our brains continue their work, replaying the day's events, worrying about tomorrow, and pondering unresolved issues. This restless brain, seemingly built without an off switch, often results in insomnia. It's a surprising oversight that we often fail to acknowledge the inherent connection between our survival-dependent thinking processes and the occurrence of insomnia.

As a society, we've reached a point where we are quick to label insomnia as a disorder necessitating treatment. Our instinctive reaction is to seek help from medical professionals, sleep clinics, therapists, and even cutting-edge technology. We reach out for medications hoping they can offer an immediate solution. However, this approach may only sometimes address the root cause of the problem, which often lies in our unquiet minds.

Mindfulness techniques, designed to help calm the mind and bring our attention to the present moment, can be particularly effective in managing insomnia. Mindfulness practice encourages a sense of tranquillity and relaxation, allowing the mind to disengage from its constant racing thoughts and fostering a conducive environment for sleep. Despite this, this approach is often overlooked in our medication-first culture, even though it could offer a more sustainable solution than pharmaceutical interventions.

Thus, advocating for and validating non-pharmaceutical approaches like mindfulness is essential. With a growing body of evidence demonstrating the efficacy of mindfulness in managing insomnia and other stress-related conditions, we need to shift the narrative from quick-fix solutions to sustainable, holistic approaches that align with our natural cognitive processes.

## The Smart Gap

One fascinating yet emotionally challenging aspect of being human is our ability to conceive and aspire to intellectual pursuits that might be slightly beyond our grasp. Whether it's theoretical physics, constitutional law, psychological fiction, or biological research at the most advanced level, recognising that such intellectual challenges might be just out of reach or tricky enough to make our efforts feel Sisyphean can cause considerable distress.

These struggles are often invisible to the outside world, leading to a general lack of dialogue or acknowledgement about their existence. However, the battle is genuine and often painfully intense for those grappling with this intellectual gap.

If you find yourself in this situation, it's crucial to be honest and acknowledge the existence of this gap. Recognising this disparity is the first step towards addressing it. The next step is to contemplate potential strategies for bridging this gap or learn how to manage it if it remains insurmountable. Denying its existence, even while it causes distress and affects your productivity, can be more detrimental than facing it head-on and developing a strategic approach.

If, after acknowledging and attempting to address the gap, it remains significant, continues to matter to you, and feels unbridgeable, there are various strategies you can employ. You could invest more effort and energy into personal growth, calming your mind, or broadening your knowledge base.

It's important to remember that intelligence is not a static attribute; it fluctuates. We all have days when we're more intellectually sharp and others when we're less so. This fluidity of cognitive abilities suggests that there's always room for improvement and growth. By harnessing this dynamic nature of intelligence, you can continuously work towards narrowing the intellectual gap, finding fulfilment in the process, and improving your intellectual and emotional well-being.

## Thinking Anxiety

Every cognitive task, whether solving complex equations, envisioning the future, or making predictions, generates inherent anxiety. This anxiety can often be managed effectively if we have developed appropriate coping mechanisms. However, we usually fail to anticipate this anxiety and end up being taken by surprise each time it arises, resulting in the use of several common yet unproductive tactics for reducing stress.

Particularly for individuals with high intellectual abilities who may face this anxiety more frequently, it's vital to be aware of these familiar yet unfortunate strategies and actively works on reducing their use. These tactics include:

1. Avoidance: We may avoid tasks that require thinking to avoid impending anxiety. This avoidance can manifest in different ways: postponing tasks that require thinking, being easily distracted while performing such tasks, or mentally disengaging and letting our minds wander to less demanding topics.

2. Employing harmful self-soothing methods: As anxiety rises during cognitive tasks, we might resort to dangerous self-soothing techniques, like excessive scratching, nail-biting, or even substance use, to help us cope with the stress.

3. Thinking small: Anxiety can push us to limit our thinking scope. Instead of engaging with more significant, more complex problems, we might focus on more minor, less intimidating issues. This strategy can have detrimental consequences, preventing us from reaching our full intellectual potential.

4. Thinking safe: Active thinking is more mentally taxing than repeating memorised information. Many people who regularly communicate with others default to repeating pre-crafted messages instead of thinking on their feet, as the latter is more challenging and anxiety-inducing.

5. Overindulging in fantasies: Those who can weave intricate narratives may spend excessive time in their fantasy worlds. This overindulgence often serves as an escape mechanism to avoid the anxiety associated with rigorous thinking.

6. Over-preparation: Engaging in activities to support our thinking process is beneficial only when actively thinking. However, if anxiety pushes us to avoid thinking, we might end up over-preparing to maintain appearances or preserve our identities. Recognising this game we play can further contribute to distress and disappointment.

7. Attempting to bypass the process: Like any authentic process, thinking involves inevitable errors and unpleasant complexities. The desire to circumvent these challenges is understandable, but unfortunately, it is not feasible. Avoiding the process can ultimately hamper the progression and evolution of our thinking capabilities.

In recognising and addressing these unhealthy coping strategies, intellectually gifted individuals can better manage the anxiety associated with their cognitive processes, enabling them to leverage their intellectual abilities fully.

## The Lure of Language and Logic

Abstract words, by nature, are intricate and multilayered in their meanings, and their utilisation often creates a web of demands, enticements, and pitfalls. Those with heightened intellectual capacities may see through the standard manipulations of language used to control, convince, or market to them. Phrases like "new and improved" or "buy two, get one free" may be met with a sceptical grin, suggesting a perceived immunity to such tactics.

However, these intellectually astute individuals are far from immune. They may be even more susceptible to the impact of language. Like the rest of society, they find themselves trapped by the metaphors and narratives woven by their culture, media, and influential figures. Even with an underlying awareness of these manipulations, they often find themselves just as influenced as anyone else, a truth that can be difficult to accept.

As someone with superior intellectual abilities, you may be adept at creating compelling narratives or crafting convincing arguments using the right combination of words. You may understand the allure and influence of language and be cautious about using it inauthentically. However, the challenge and associated discomfort persist. If you're aware of this dynamic, you're likely to see its evidence everywhere, which can lead to frustration and anger.

There may be times when you can do practically nothing or absolutely nothing about these situations. You may find yourself standing there, furious, scorned by circumstances, and in pain. Simultaneously, you may be strongly tempted to use language and logic, in the same way to protect yourself, make your points, or advance your interests. As such, you will also have to confront your hypocrisy. These dilemmas arise due to our brains' imperfect application of language and logic. They demonstrate that even intellectual prowess cannot wholly safeguard us from the challenges and manipulations inherent in our language-centric society.

## The Lure of Mysticism

An intellectually astute individual, who might have been inundated with religious ideologies during childhood but recognises the real mysteries surrounding the universe's origins, can find themselves in a state of distress if they adopt an oversimplified form of mysticism. Conversely, they reject this simplistic mysticism, openly acknowledging their lack of ultimate answers and the inability to possess them. In that case, they become susceptible to the icy desolation accompanying the suspicion of an indifferent universe.

Embedded within this justification for mysticism is the premise that humans would disintegrate if they accepted life as merely what it appears to be - empty, cold, impersonal, and devoid of purpose. However, this is a misapprehension. The fundamental dichotomy does not lie between a comforting but unauthentic mysticism and accepting an apathetic universe. Instead, it is a choice between oversimplified magic and the acknowledgement of genuine mystery.

Natural psychology takes a different stance. It allows the concept of mystery to retain its authentic complexity and resist reduction to the transparent, simple, or obvious. When intellectually gifted person ultimately accepts the existence of unsolvable mysteries, they can find relief and joy. By respecting the reality that ultimate answers remain elusive to all, recognising the difference between what is not yet known and what is fundamentally unknowable, understanding that speculation isn't equivalent to genuine knowledge, and acknowledging that soothing practices like meditation or nature walks offer comfort but don't provide ultimate answers, one can step away from superficial mysticism. This acceptance leads to the understanding that the responsibility of navigating one's life resides squarely in their hands.

## A Firm but Not Proud Conviction

Numerous intelligent individuals find themselves in a perplexing situation, steadfast but unenthusiastic in their belief that nothing in life genuinely piques their curiosity or can potentially spark their interest. They assert, perhaps without complete conviction, their yearning for something that could captivate their interest passionately. However, their assertions ring slightly insincere, as vacuous as the protestations of an artist devoted to self-starvation.

The process of reclaiming a sense of purpose and meaning entails a multitude of practices and is deserving of a more comprehensive discussion. Each individual succumbing to the absence of meaning or purpose in life likely reached that state through their unique journey. It's doubtful that a single pathway leads to a lifetime of intense meaninglessness. There are many methods through which one can obliterate a sense of purpose: displaying apathy, abstaining from commitment, lacking courage, refraining from making choices, failing to conquer personal demons, and refusing to take a stand. Despite the diversity of paths leading to this state of 'hunger', the recovery process can appear remarkably uniform. It encompasses a potent and convincing shift in paradigm, mental model, and attitude towards personal meaning-making. With this paradigm shift, self-imposed fasting from life's inherent purpose and meaning can finally be terminated.

## Unreasonable Self-Pestering

We've examined the sad reality prevalent among many: living a life devoid of substantial meaning. Numerous factors contribute to this state, the primary one being that individuals are often unaware of the necessity to create sense to possess it. A secondary but crucial factor is that many individuals, particularly those with a higher intellect, incessantly bombard themselves with internal dialogue, leaving little space for cultivating a sense of purpose.

This internal bombardment doesn't merely consist of negative self-talk. It also encompasses what may initially appear to be entirely rational pondering, wherein one poses a series of reasonable questions and subsequently feels obligated to answer each query.

However, a thought deemed reasonable does not warrant consideration (and, preferably, should not even be formulated) if its contemplation does not contribute to your quest for meaning. Creating value-based sense is achieved by entertaining thoughts that facilitate your pursuit of purpose, not by dwelling on ideas that are simply rational. 

An intelligent individual possesses a brain inclined to relentlessly barrage them with an array of reasonable thoughts, often at the expense of living a life imbued with meaning. Eventually, it might dawn upon them that a thought's reasonableness isn't the sole criterion that warrants its consideration. What's more significant is whether or not the idea aligns with their intentions of seeking meaning. To ascertain this, they will need to identify what their meaning-oriented choices are. Upon doing so, the relentless barrage of rational thoughts may suddenly subside. Can it magically cease entirely? No - reasonable thoughts are reasonable, and we must permit a specific number to engage us. However, we can substantially curtail their frequency if we focus on seeking meaning.

## The Pain of Appraising

An intelligent individual is capable of clear thinking, at least intermittently. The consequence of such cogent thought, wise vision, and utilisation of the brain's latent power is the ability to perceive the illogical and erroneous notions surrounding him—this, however, gives rise to a grave new set of challenges.

Primarily, it is disheartening and isolating to comprehend that most people harbour—and can be swayed into adopting—misguided and hazardous beliefs. Secondly, their capacity to perceive clearly will compel them to acknowledge their mistakes and deficiencies, in addition to the stark reality of their circumstances.

Every instance of stepping back to evaluate presents a risk of falling into the trap of self-inflicted harassment. Stepping back and assessing, which an efficient brain feels morally obligated to perform, diminishes your capacity to fully endorse any viewpoint or stance. For instance, during wartime, if you step back and perceive your adversary as a fellow human being, this dramatically reduces your ability to launch an attack against them, regardless of the potentially compelling reasons for doing so. 

This thoughtful detachment can instigate a crippling dilemma: the constant tug-of-war between objective analysis and emotional engagement. This dilemma can become a recurring torment for intelligent individuals, a side-effect of their enhanced cognitive abilities. Consequently, managing this balance of clear-headed appraisal and genuine involvement becomes crucial in their quest for meaning and peace.

## The God-Bug Syndrome

Two opposing sentiments incessantly harass an intellectually gifted individual within a first-world society: firstly, the sense of being an unparalleled creation of nature, and secondly, the stark realisation that he is essentially insignificant, a brief spark of life soon to dissolve back into the cosmic abyss.

This amalgamation of justifiable self-importance and equally justifiable self-deprecation, where a potentially healthy narcissistic inclination towards one's distinctiveness clashes head-on with existential reality, results in individuals with a fluctuating spectrum of behaviours. They may appear confident one moment and impotent the following, display motivation at one point and apathy at another, exhibit diligence and perseverance at one moment and succumb to indulgence and addiction the next.

Conventional psychological theories have perceived this tension as a disorder, encapsulating the paradoxical dynamic within phrases like 'delusions of grandeur' and 'inferiority complex'. However, fundamentally, what we're examining isn't a pathological condition but a complete and conflicting comprehension: an understanding that we hold significance contrasting starkly with the realisation of our brief existence—knowledge, in essence, that we matter yet simultaneously do not.

This dual awareness encapsulates the human condition in a modern society, a society that simultaneously empowers us with the sense of our potential while reminding us of our ultimate insignificance. This tension and inner struggle do not indicate mental dysfunction; instead, it mirrors the quintessential existential dichotomy inherent in the human experience. It's a testament to our ability to hold contrasting truths within us, acknowledge our grandeur and transience, and reconcile our existential worth with our existential irrelevance.

## Coming to Grips with Meaning

The quest for meaning is likely to be more complex for the intellectually gifted than for the average person. Their ability to form abstract concepts, perceive the existential nature of reality, and assess the intricate mechanics of the cosmos allows them to delve deeper into questions of purpose and significance. However, with a proper understanding of the nature of meaning, the intellectual struggle associated with it can be significantly mitigated.

Fundamentally, meaning is a psychological experience. It arises when our ongoing subjective experience is imbued with a particular resonant quality—a sense of correctness, an encompassing feeling akin to standing before an ocean, a feeling of synthesis and unification, or an intense realisation of significance. Perhaps it's an experience of delight or gratification; these sensations collectively give us the impression that life is imbued with meaning.

The quest for meaning presents a tremendous challenge—especially since we talk about 'making meaning' and 'creating meaning', but we are essentially advocating a certain kind of effort with no guaranteed outcomes. A practitioner of natural psychology who diligently evaluates their values and what matters to them directs themselves towards the pursuit of meaning, put in the necessary effort, and then lets go. 

Natural psychology begins with the understanding that humans can find virtually anything meaningful. However, we tend to value ourselves more when the meaning we derive aligns with our principles and values rather than when it emerges spontaneously, without conscious thought. In essence, the purpose we consciously and thoughtfully construct, adhering to our values, is the most precious form of meaning we can derive from our lives. It gives us a sense of purpose, direction, and alignment with our deeply held beliefs and principles, leading to a more fulfilling and meaningful existence.

## Making Daily Meaning

Emphasising the significance of creating and maintaining a sense of meaning, we must build strategies to incorporate this process into our daily routine. The following points illustrate a guide to creating a consistent, practical framework for daily meaning creation:

1. **Orientation**: Begin each day by aligning yourself towards the direction of meaning. Start your day with purpose and intention.
2. **Daily Morning Practice**: Dedicate the initial part of your day to an activity that directly contributes to your sense of meaning. This could be an action-based activity or a state of mindful being. This daily effort accumulates "meaning capital" over time, thereby building resilience against crises of meaning.
3. **Address Meaning Challenges**: Identify your greatest challenge in creating meaning. Rather than ignoring or avoiding it, consciously decide on an action plan to tackle this challenge for the day.
4. **Contextual Meaning**: Recognize that life comprises a series of unique moments. Meaning is not solely derived from abiding by abstract principles but should be created by each special moment.
5. **Anticipate**: Be mindful of the time ahead and declare how you wish to spend it.
6. **Define Free Time**: Free time isn't necessarily leisure time. It should be approached with much thoughtfulness as any other part of your day.
7. **Allow Ease**: Avoid the perception of being on an endless quest for meaning, allowing you to relax and enjoy moments as they come.
8. **Invest in Being**: Being mindful of your attitude is as crucial in creating meaning as choosing meaningful activities.
9. **Align Thoughts with Intentions**: Continuously align your thoughts with your intentions, reinforcing your sense of purpose and direction.
10. **Align Behaviors with Intentions**: Similarly, ensure your actions align with your intentions, reinforcing your commitment to your purpose.
11. **Leverage Your Available Personality**: We possess an inherent, formed, and available personality. Utilise your public character - the part that maintains self-awareness, sets intentions and expresses freedom - to create meaning.
12. **Explore Meaning Opportunities**: Understanding your unique preferences is critical; you might derive more meaning from achieving goals, while relationships and love might hold more significance for others.
13. **Manage Meaning Leaks**: Should you encounter a situation that seems to drain your sense of meaning, act promptly to address it. These situations might be emotionally challenging but also impact your sense of purpose.
14. **Address Special Circumstances**: Be vigilant about any special events or situations that might impact your relationship with meaning. Act quickly when a potential threat to your sense of purpose arises.
15. **Regular Practice**: View life as an ongoing practice where each day serves as an opportunity to cultivate and enhance your sense of meaning.

By following these steps, you can develop a personalised routine that ensures the constant presence of meaning in your life, enhancing overall fulfilment and satisfaction.

## Embracing Shifting Meanings

Addressing the complexities of high intelligence involves multifaceted strategies, as the issues encountered can vary widely. Among these challenges is the existential question of the meaning of life. The search for meaning can be daunting for an intelligent individual due to their ability to explore and question various dimensions of existence. 

The notion that life does not possess a single, ultimate meaning might be disturbing or liberating. However, the essential understanding lies in realising that life comprises a spectrum of human experiences that generate sense. These can range from transient instances of significance, conjectures about purpose, personally crafted interpretations of life, and subjective evaluations about the meaningfulness of experiences.

Regardless of the initial emotional response to this perspective, an intelligent individual will recognise its truthfulness. This is because it aligns with the reality of subjective human experiences rather than a universal, absolute meaning. Accepting this view, an intelligent person embraces the truth of varied, personalised purposes of life and uses it as a guide to making informed decisions.

Using their intelligence to identify what feels authentic and meaningful, they can construct a life that resonates deeply with their values and aspirations. Instead of seeking a singular, predefined meaning of life, they generate a unique blend of senses continuously shaped by their experiences, interpretations, and personal growth. 

This proactive approach to meaning-making allows them to face the inherent uncertainties of life with a sense of agency and purpose. In doing so, they empower themselves to create a life that, while acknowledging the absence of ultimate universal meaning, is rich with personally significant implications and fulfils their desire for authenticity.

## A Blueprint For Smart

The transformation of self into an entity of beauty—into the very beauty that colours and enriches one's life—may seem monumental. However, it becomes more manageable and meaningful when seen in the light of intentional living and daily actions. As one among the 1.5 billion individuals who make up the most competent 15 per cent of the world's population, you are not part of a homogeneous unit. You and your counterparts represent a vast array of unique perspectives, ideas, and approaches to life. While you do not collectively constitute a force for good, nor will you ever stand unified in thought and action, your potential is boundless.

Within this vast array, you can shape your existence. You can mitigate your distress, confront your obstacles most effectively, and cultivate an inner beauty from your deliberate and consistent efforts. It is not the effortless attainment of a utopian ideal but the conscientious endeavour to live authentically each day, to make decisions that reflect your values, and to strive for your personal best. This transformative journey is possible and a call to embrace our human potential.

In a world filled with contrasting views and differing paths, your power resides in your intelligence, resilience, and intentional ability. You can shine brightly as an individual, not by adhering to the prescribed ideals of others but by living a life that resonates with your truths and aspirations. We, as humans, possess the unique ability to carve out such existences for ourselves.

Despite life's inevitable complexities and contradictions, we can cultivate beauty within ourselves—beauty that permeates our very existence and leaves a lasting imprint on our journey. By striving to lead lives that fill us with pride each day, standing up in the face of adversity, and living with intention and awareness, we reflect the essence of humanity. And in doing so, we create a world imbued with the unique beauty of our existence.
