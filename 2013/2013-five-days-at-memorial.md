# Five Days at Memorial
**Author**: Sheri Fink | **Year**: 2013

## Summary
"Five Days at Memorial" is a gripping work of investigative journalism that reconstructs the harrowing events at Memorial Medical Center in New Orleans during and after Hurricane Katrina. When floodwaters overwhelmed the hospital in 2005, healthcare workers faced impossible choices as resources dwindled, temperatures soared, and evacuation seemed unlikely. The book centers on the controversial deaths of 20 patients—many of whom were injected with lethal doses of morphine and midazolam—and the subsequent investigation that culminated in murder charges against Dr. Anna Pou and two nurses.

This meticulously researched narrative combines medical drama, legal thriller, and ethical examination to explore what happens when disaster medicine meets life-and-death decision making. Fink, a physician and journalist, spent six years investigating the events, conducting hundreds of interviews and reviewing thousands of documents to piece together what really happened in those five critical days.

The book is essential reading for healthcare professionals, disaster preparedness officials, bioethicists, and anyone interested in exploring the moral boundaries of medical care under extreme conditions. Readers will gain profound insights into disaster response protocols, ethical decision-making frameworks, and how quickly professional standards can blur in crisis situations.

## The Essential Story

### Hurricane Katrina's Devastation (Days 1-2)
Memorial Medical Center initially seemed to have weathered Hurricane Katrina when it struck on August 29, 2005. The building sustained damage but remained functional on backup power. However, when the levees broke and floodwaters inundated New Orleans, the hospital became an island of desperation. Power failed except for limited emergency generators, air conditioning stopped working in 100°F+ heat, and resources rapidly dwindled. Over 2,000 people—including patients, staff, and family members—were trapped without clear evacuation plans.

**The Critical Situation**: The hospital's emergency plan had failed to anticipate such extensive flooding. Food and water supplies were limited, critical medicines were running low, and the rising water made evacuation seem impossible. Communications systems collapsed, leaving hospital workers isolated and uncertain about rescue efforts.

### The LifeCare Hospital Controversy (Day 3)
Memorial housed LifeCare, a long-term acute care facility on the seventh floor with 82 frail patients who depended on ventilators and specialized care. As conditions deteriorated, these vulnerable patients became increasingly impossible to care for properly. The power failure meant manual ventilation was required, and the extreme heat further endangered their lives. Hospital staff faced agonizing decisions about which patients could be saved and which were too sick or heavy to evacuate.

**The Turning Point**: On Wednesday, August 31, Memorial executives allegedly made the decision that patients would receive lethal doses rather than be left to suffer. Dr. Anna Pou, along with nurses Lori Budo and Cheri Landry, administered injections of morphine and midazolam to at least nine LifeCare patients.

### The Evacuation and Aftermath (Days 4-5)
On Thursday, September 1, rescue helicopters finally arrived and began evacuating patients. The medical staff prioritized those deemed "salvageable," while the sickest patients were left behind. By the end of the evacuation, 45 patients were dead—20 of whom had been injected with drugs. The Louisiana attorney general launched an investigation, eventually charging Dr. Pou and the two nurses with second-degree murder in 2006.

**The Legal Battle**: The case became a national sensation, raising fundamental questions about medical ethics under emergency conditions. After a grueling legal process, a grand jury refused to indict the three healthcare workers in 2007, effectively ending the criminal case but leaving the ethical questions unanswered.

## Key Characters

- **Dr. Anna Pou**: A dedicated head and neck surgeon who became the central figure in the euthanasia allegations. She had stayed at the hospital out of concern for her patients but ultimately faced murder charges for her actions.

- **Susan Mulderick**: The nursing director and designated incident commander who led the hospital's disaster response. She exemplified the impossible pressure faced by healthcare administrators during crises.

- **LifeCare Patients**: Vulnerable, chronically ill patients who depended on ventilators and specialized care. They included elderly residents like Emmett Everett (380 pounds), Wilda McManus, Alice Hutzler, and Rose Savoie—many of whom became victims of the alleged euthanasia.

- **Dr. Bryant King**: An internal medicine specialist who raised concerns about what was happening and became a key witness for investigators, breaking the "code of silence" that descended upon Memorial staff after the evacuation.

## Best Quotes

> "The only way the staff could evacuate was if they could report there were no more living patients to take care of. This was not about compassion or mercy. It was about throwing someone else over the side of the lifeboat in order to save themselves."

> "I am going to give you something to make you feel better," Dr. Anna Pou reportedly told patients before administering the lethal injections.

> "If you don't feel comfortable, don't do it, because it will come back to haunt you. The first time I did it, I wasn't ready and it haunted me for two years," Dr. Pou allegedly told one nurse who refused to participate in administering drugs.

> "We're not talking about it... And by the way, nothing happened" — how hospital staff described their code of silence about the events.

## Key Takeaways

- **Disaster Preparedness Gaps**: The tragedy revealed critical failures in hospital disaster planning, particularly for prolonged power outages and flood scenarios.

- **Ethical Frameworks Under Pressure**: The book demonstrates how standard medical ethics can break down under extreme conditions, leaving caregivers to make impossible choices without clear guidelines.

- **Resource Allocation Dilemmas**: Memorial became a microcosm of the brutal triage decisions required in mass casualty situations—essentially, who gets saved and who gets left behind.

- **Corporate Responsibility Questions**: The investigation raised concerns about whether hospital corporation Tenet Healthcare failed to provide adequate resources and evacuation planning for their facilities.

## Questions to Consider

1. **Where is the line** between palliative care to relieve suffering and active euthanasia in disaster situations?

2. **Who should decide** which patients get prioritized for evacuation when resources are limited—doctors, hospital administrators, or government officials?

3. **What responsibility** do hospitals and healthcare corporations have for ensuring their facilities can withstand catastrophic events?

4. **How should society** balance compassion for caregivers making impossible decisions with accountability for potential abuses of power?

5. **What protocols** should be established for medical care during prolonged disaster scenarios when evacuation is delayed or uncertain?

## Conclusion
"Five Days at Memorial" is an essential, profoundly disturbing examination of what happens when medical ethics meet catastrophic disaster. Fink's meticulous reporting reveals both the heroism of healthcare workers who stayed to care for patients and the horrifying decisions made when systems failed and desperation mounted.

This book is worth your time not just for its gripping narrative but for its vital exploration of ethical boundaries in medical care. It serves as both a cautionary tale about disaster preparedness and a compassionate look at the moral dilemmas faced by healthcare professionals in impossible circumstances.

The biggest reason to read this book is its unflinching look at how quickly civilized behavior can break down under extreme pressure, and the urgent need for clear ethical frameworks and disaster protocols before—not during—the next catastrophe. In an era of increasing climate disasters and pandemic threats, the questions raised by "Five Days at Memorial" have never been more relevant.
