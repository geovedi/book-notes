**Authors**: Luiz Del Col, Mauricio Filho | **Year**: 2013

## Summary
"PMO Fighter" is a practical guide for Project Management Officers working on complex megaprojects in large corporations. The book addresses the high-stakes environment where PMOs must navigate aggressive schedules, multiple stakeholders, and organizational politics to ensure project success. The authors emphasize that in today's global business scenario, the PMO's role is crucial - they share responsibility for project success or failure alongside Project Managers.

This book targets professionals dealing with large-scale projects who want insights into successful PMO behavior, attitude, and performance. It's particularly valuable for those working in complex environments with hundreds of suppliers and difficult scope organization. Readers will learn practical strategies for pushing results, controlling activities, and surviving the pressure-cooker environment of corporate megaprojects.

## Core Insights

### The Art of Pushing and Controlling
The fundamental skill that separates successful PMOs from others is their relentless focus on pushing and controlling project activities. The authors argue that if you're not passionate about pushing and controlling, you shouldn't be a PMO. This means being persistent in your actions while understanding that pushing is an art that requires cultural sensitivity and emotional intelligence.

> "If you are not crazy about pushing and controlling, you can be anything but a PMO!"

**Quick Take**: Effective pushing requires understanding organizational culture and adapting your approach. In some companies, direct conversations work best; in others, formal emails are more effective. Never try to change the company culture to suit your style - instead, absorb, incorporate, and respect existing norms.

### The PMO's Essential Toolkit
Every successful PMO needs a comprehensive toolkit to manage complex projects. The book outlines 17 essential tools including templates for meeting minutes and status reports, risk management matrices, critical path analysis, and escalation protocols. The most critical tool is the action items control spreadsheet that tracks all pending activities with responsible parties and deadlines.

> "The PMO's biggest mission is to keep an eye on the upcoming 'tsunamis' that might ruin the project."

**Quick Take**: Your toolkit is only as good as your discipline in using it. Establish routines for daily or weekly tracking, and always have your critical information "in your pocket" when managers request updates.

### The TBD Dilemma
"To Be Defined" deadlines are a PMO's nightmare that can become a dangerous lifestyle if not addressed aggressively. When PMs start responding with TBDs instead of concrete dates, the PMO must intervene immediately. The authors provide three strategies: don't accept TBDs and escalate immediately, work with midterm dates (dates when you'll get a real deadline), or establish dates yourself (after informing the PM first).

> "If a status report contains TBDs, the PMO will be blamed for it, not the PM."

**Quick Take**: Never accept TBDs as a permanent solution. They indicate planning failure and compromise critical path milestones. Use escalation as your primary tool to force concrete commitments.

### Understanding Management Theories
PMOs must navigate between Theory X (authoritarian, fear-based management) and Theory Y (democratic, empowerment-based management) environments. In Theory X companies, PMOs need to be fighters who can take hits and keep going despite being questioned and doubted. In Theory Y environments, the challenge is getting consensus when everyone has decision-making power.

> "On 'X Theory management' you have to be PMO fighter, not because you have to hit harder, but because you have to be ready to receive a harder hit and keep fighting."

**Quick Take**: Identify which management theory dominates your company culture and adapt your approach accordingly. Both environments require different strategies, but both need PMOs who can maintain focus and drive results.

### Removing the Rugs
The PMO's role is to remove the "rugs" under which managers hide delays and problems. This means making complex charts simple, consolidating information, and presenting project status clearly - warts and all. The authors warn that lying about delays is common in project environments, and PMOs must develop skills for hunting truth without taking deception personally.

> "Try helping removing the 'rugs' to show the truth and help the manager with the critical points and delays."

**Quick Take**: Your value to the organization lies in providing accurate, unvarnished information that enables good decision-making. Don't let complex graphics or selective data presentation obscure the real project status.

### The Traffic Light System
Projects should be categorized using green, yellow, and red indicators based on deviation from the baseline. The authors provide three criteria sets: (5-10% threshold), (10-20% threshold), and aggressive (1-5% threshold). The key is communicating your criteria clearly and showing trends through risk assessment, not just current status.

> "There is a question that must be answered by the PMO in every status report: is the project on the green, yellow or red?"

**Quick Take**: Choose criteria that match your project's tolerance for delays and communicate them consistently. Always show trends through risk assessment, as current green status might turn yellow soon due to emerging risks.
