This darkly humorous exploration of funeral customs takes readers on a fascinating journey through the weirdest, creepiest, and most bizarre death traditions from around the world and throughout history. Benjamin proves that humanity's creativity doesn't stop when it comes to disposing of bodies—everything from vampire prevention techniques to modern cryogenics gets its moment in the spotlight.

Perfect for history buffs, morbid curiosity seekers, and anyone who thinks standard funerals are boring, this book reveals that dealing with death has inspired some of humanity's most imaginative, disturbing, and occasionally hilarious practices.

## Core Insights

### Human Creativity Knows No Bounds—Even in Death
From the beginning of ritual burial 100,000 years ago, humans have shown incredible ingenuity in how we treat our dead. The book demonstrates that funeral practices reflect our deepest beliefs, fears, and cultural values, whether it's Chinese aristocrats buried in jade suits, Victorians posing with corpses for photographs, or modern sports fans requesting team-themed coffins.

> "While you would think burying your dead would be pretty self-explanatory (dig a hole and then cry over it for a bit), history proves that there is no limit to the human imagination, especially when it comes to getting rid of dead bodies."

**Quick Take**: Funeral traditions are a mirror reflecting what each culture values most—from the afterlife to social status to family honor.

### Death Has Always Been Big Business
The funeral industry's billion-dollar annual revenue isn't a modern phenomenon. From ancient Egyptian tomb builders to medieval gravediggers stealing clothes for fashion, to modern crematorium scandals, people have been monetizing death for millennia. The book reveals how economic motives have shaped funeral practices throughout history.

The infamous "Grim Eater" of New Zealand who attended up to four funerals per week for free food, or Jean Baptiste who robbed 300 corpses for their clothing, show that where there's death, there's opportunity.

**Quick Take**: Where there's grief, there's someone trying to make a profit—whether selling jade burial suits or just pocketing the funeral buffet.

### Fear of the Dead Shapes Our Rituals
Many bizarre funeral practices stem from fear that the dead might not stay dead. The book catalogues numerous "undead burial precautions" from different cultures: stones shoved in mouths to prevent vampires, stakes through hearts in Bulgaria, and even New England families burning organs of suspected vampire corpses in the 1890s.

These practices weren't limited to medieval times—the same techniques were used in parts of America until the early 20th century, showing how deep-seated our fear of the restless dead really is.

**Quick Take**: We're more afraid of the dead coming back than we are of death itself.

### Cultural Differences Reveal Universal Truths
Despite covering funeral practices from every continent and thousands of years of history, the book reveals universal human concerns: ensuring the dead reach the afterlife properly, maintaining family honor, dealing with grief, and asserting social status even after death.

Whether it's Chinese hanging coffins, Indian suttee (widow burning), Brazilian funerary cannibalism, or Italian bone chapels, every culture struggles with the same fundamental questions about mortality and meaning.

**Quick Take**: How we treat our dead says more about how we live than about death itself.

### Modern Technology Meets Ancient Practices
The book's final sections show how technology is revolutionizing death: cryogenic freezing, environmental burial options, space burial, diamond creation from ashes, and even pet cloning. Yet these modern innovations often serve the same ancient purposes—preserving memory, asserting status, and attempting to conquer death.

The "Frozen Dead Guy Days" festival in Colorado, celebrating a cryogenically preserved corpse, perfectly illustrates how new technology meets ancient ritual in bizarre combinations.

**Quick Take**: No matter how advanced our technology gets, we're still just trying to solve the same problems our ancestors faced 100,000 years ago.

## Best Quotes

- "You are going to die. It's true and it's something that everyone has to come to terms with eventually. You will die, and no matter what afterlife or lack thereof you think you are headed for, the body you left behind suddenly needs to be disposed of as quickly as possible."

- "According to most studies, people's number one fear is public speaking. Number two is death... This means to the average person, if you go to a funeral, you're better off in the casket than doing the eulogy."

- "While most people should be given a proper and respectful funeral when they die spans all times and cultures, there is also a long-standing desire to see that bad people get the exact opposite."

## Action Items

- **Plan ahead**: Consider what you actually want done with your body—your family might not honor your wishes otherwise, as the book shows with multiple examples of ignored wills and funeral preferences.

- **Question traditions**: Many funeral practices we consider "normal" were once controversial (like cremation) or serve commercial rather than cultural interests.

- **Explore alternatives**: From green burials to space memorials to donating your body to science, there are more options today than ever before.

- **Talk to your family**: Discuss your funeral wishes while you're still alive—otherwise you might end up as someone's "Weekend at Bernie's" story or sports-themed coffin display.

## Questions to Consider

- What does your culture's funeral practices reveal about your deepest values and fears?

- How much of what we consider "dignified" funeral behavior is actually recent commercial invention rather than ancient tradition?

- If you could design any funeral tradition (regardless of cost or practicality), what would it say about how you want to be remembered?

- Why are humans so fascinated by the macabre and bizarre aspects of death, even while we fear dying ourselves?

## Conclusion

**Is this worth your time?** Absolutely—if you have a dark sense of humor and are fascinated by the stranger side of human history. Benjamin's writing balances morbid curiosity with genuine historical insight, never taking herself too seriously while respecting the cultural significance of even the weirdest practices.

**The biggest reason to read this book**: It will forever change how you think about funerals, death, and human creativity. You'll never look at a standard church burial the same way again—and you'll appreciate the freedom we have today to choose how we want to be remembered, whether that means turning into a diamond, getting shot into space, or just avoiding being eaten by your relatives.
