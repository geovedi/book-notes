**Authors**: Amanda J Field | **Year**: 2013

## Summary
This practical guide demystifies the process of working with graphic designers for business professionals who need professional design but may not understand how to commission it effectively. Field argues that design is a professional service, not a commodity, and provides a comprehensive framework for building successful designer-client relationships that deliver both creative excellence and business value.

The book is essential for business owners, marketing managers, and anyone who commissions design work, offering actionable strategies to avoid common pitfalls like committee decision-making, poor briefing processes, and treating design as a cost center rather than an investment. Readers will gain confidence in selecting the right designers, writing effective briefs, and managing the creative process to achieve their business objectives.

## Core Insights

### 1. Design is a Professional Service, Not a Commodity
The fundamental mistake many businesses make is treating design like a commodity to be purchased at the lowest possible price. Just as owning a scalpel doesn't make someone a heart surgeon, owning design software doesn't make someone a designer. Professional designers bring strategic thinking, creative expertise, and business understanding that cannot be replicated by in-house amateurs or template-based solutions.

> "Thinking you can design because you own a sophisticated computer design program is a bit like thinking you can be a heart surgeon because you own a scalpel."

**Quick Take**: Invest in professional design for strategic work (brand identity, corporate materials) but create a portfolio of designers for different needs and budgets.

### 2. Build a Strategic Designer Portfolio
Rather than using multiple ad-hoc designers or putting all work with one agency, develop a curated portfolio of approved designers. For strategic work like corporate identity and major campaigns, use top-tier designers who understand business strategy. For routine materials like flyers and presentations, use more cost-effective designers who work within established brand guidelines.

> "Unless you are a very small organisation, you are likely to build a portfolio of designers, each handling a different aspect of your business."

**Quick Take**: Appoint one strategic designer for high-level work and brand guidelines, then use a network of approved designers for routine projects.

### 3. The Power of Inspirational Briefing
Distinguish between a "brief" (inspirational vision) and "briefing" (detailed requirements). Great design comes from clear, inspiring direction coupled with comprehensive background information. The classic example: Coca-Cola's brief to "design a bottle I can recognize in the dark" conveyed their need for differentiation while giving designers creative freedom.

> "The brief for the Coca-Cola bottle is a good example of an inspirational brief. They said 'design a bottle I can recognize in the dark': a succinct brief that conveyed the idea that they were looking for differentiation."

**Quick Take**: Always brief designers with the problem, not the solution. Give them constraints as creative challenges rather than limitations.

### 4. Avoid the Two-Concept Trap
When designers present multiple concepts, it often indicates they haven't done the creative work themselves. Insist on seeing only their strongest, most recommended solution. This forces designers to make tough decisions and shows they have the courage of their convictions.

> "The first rule about design concepts is that you really only need one concept presented. Most clients are used to seeing two, and having to choose between them. This might be the right way to buy a pair of trousers, but it's not necessarily the best way to buy design."

**Quick Take**: Expect your designers to present their strongest solution with confidence and clear rationale.

### 5. Single Point of Authority Essential
Design by committee always produces compromised results. Establish one person as the project owner with ultimate decision-making authority. Other stakeholders can provide input at specific stages, but final approval must rest with one designated person to maintain consistency and quality.

> "You can spot something that's been designed by committee a mile away. It is always a compromise and always a second-rate job, so you need to fight to avoid it."

**Quick Take**: Fight for single-point approval rights; gather input when helpful but maintain final decision authority.

## Best Quotes

- "Good design is good business."
  _Thomas Watson Jnr, IBM_

- "Design templates on programs such as Microsoft Word, Adobe InDesign or QuarkXPress may be tempting to use, and will give a superficially professional look to your design, but they are not always the answer: you still need good concepts that are not clichéd or passé."

- "The development of computer-based publishing programs has transformed the graphic design business. The good news is that packages like QuarkXPress, Adobe InDesign and PhotoShop have enabled professional designers to turn work around quickly... The downside is that it has put the ability to be a 'designer' into the hands of every business person."

- "The most revered designers in the country are still capable of producing inappropriate or poor work unless they are properly managed."

- "House styles will produce a set of 'rules' to follow, this does not mean they have to be a straitjacket which will stifle any originality or creativity."

## Action Items

- Audit your current design materials and identify inconsistencies between professionally designed and in-house created materials
- Create a comprehensive briefing template that covers objectives, key messages, brand personality, constraints, timeline, and budget
