# Manager as a Role Model: A Guide to Better Management
**Authors**: Jon Allen | **Year**: 2013 | **Category**: Business & Finance

## Summary
This practical management guide explores how leaders can become powerful role models through conscious behavior and attitude modeling. Based on neuro-linguistic programming (NLP) principles, the book reveals that managers unintentionally set examples for their teams through every action, gesture, and word—making conscious role modeling essential for effective leadership.

The book serves both new and experienced managers who want to lead through example rather than command, showing how to develop the behaviors and attitudes that inspire teams to cooperate, innovate, and take ownership. Readers will learn practical techniques for modeling excellence and for learning from others they admire.

## Core Insights

### Modeling Excellence Starts with Self-Awareness
Managers are always role models, whether they want to be or not. Team members unconsciously absorb behaviors, attitudes, and communication patterns from their leaders through constant observation. The key insight is that modeling happens automatically—people learn by watching others rather than by being told what to do.

> "We don't do as we're told to, we do what we see other people doing, what seems to have succeeded for them."

**Quick Take**: Your team is watching you constantly and will模仿 your behaviors, both good and bad. Conscious awareness of your modeling impact is the first step toward effective leadership.

### Behaviors vs. Attitudes: The Complete Model
Effective role modeling requires attention to both external behaviors and internal attitudes. While behaviors are observable actions and communication patterns, attitudes reflect the underlying beliefs and mindsets that drive those behaviors. The book emphasizes that attitudes are harder to fake—people detect genuine versus pretended attitudes.

> "If you don't believe in whatever it is your organisation produces or offers as a service, then neither will the people who work for you."

**Quick Take**: Align your internal beliefs with external actions. Authentic leadership comes from genuine conviction, not superficial behavior modification.

### The Modeling Process: Learn from the Best
The book outlines a systematic approach to learning excellence through conscious modeling: observe physical posture, voice patterns, and language; understand the person's mental approach; practice the complete pattern; then adapt it to fit your natural style while maintaining effectiveness.

> "It's the sort of thing that we do when we're feeling good. In my experience, the things that people want from each other, the things that make a work place effective in terms of behaviours are the behaviours that make common sense to us."

**Quick Take**: Choose role models selectively based on specific characteristics you want to develop, then adapt their excellence to fit your authentic personality.

### Recovery and Honesty: Leadership Imperfection
When managers fail to model effectively, the book recommends honest acknowledgment rather than denial. Admitting mistakes and demonstrating commitment to improvement actually strengthens respect and provides a valuable example of growth mindset.

> "I'm sorry, I would prefer for us to be able to work well together but I've just managed to cause an enormous row with you and it really was my fault. Could we start this conversation again?"

**Quick Take**: Vulnerability and honesty about modeling failures demonstrates the learning mindset you want to cultivate in your team.

### Self-Care as Leadership Foundation
Consistent role modeling requires personal well-being. The book emphasizes that managers must maintain their physical and mental state to provide reliable examples for their teams. Sometimes the best leadership example is demonstrating healthy boundaries and self-care.

> "Being a caring manager doesn't necessarily mean that you are constantly available for all your staff and all the things they want to bring to you, caring sometimes means sending people away and setting the example of someone who knows how to care for themselves."

**Quick Take**: Your personal sustainability modeling is as important as your professional behavior modeling.

- Which characteristics would you most like to develop through conscious modeling?
- How do you handle situations where you fail to model effectively?

## Conclusion
This book offers a refreshing perspective on leadership that moves beyond traditional command-and-control approaches to embrace the power of example. Its strength lies in making the unconscious process of role modeling conscious and actionable, giving managers practical tools for developing both their behavior and attitudes.

The modeling process and recovery strategies provide immediately applicable techniques for leadership development, while the emphasis on authenticity prevents the guide from becoming another superficial leadership formula. This is worth your time if you're ready to accept that your example matters more than your instructions, and you're willing to do the internal work required to lead through influence rather than authority.

The biggest reason to read this book is its practical approach to a fundamental leadership truth: people do what people see, not what people are told.
