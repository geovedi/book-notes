# Colonising Myths - Māori Realities
**Authors**: Ani Mikaere | **Year**: 2013 | **Category**: History & Biography

## Summary

This powerful collection of essays dismantles the foundational myths of New Zealand's colonial project while illuminating the lived realities of Māori people navigating an imposed legal and cultural system. Mikaere, a prominent Māori legal scholar, draws on her experiences as a legal academic and activist to expose how colonial law operates as an "imposter legal system" that continues to disenfranchise Indigenous peoples while maintaining the illusion of bicultural partnership.

The book systematically deconstructs key colonial narratives—from the Treaty of Waitangi's supposed legitimacy to contemporary policies of "closing the gaps"—revealing how these serve to perpetuate Pākehā dominance while masking the ongoing impacts of colonization. Through five distinct sections, Mikaere examines everything from institutional racism in legal education to the fundamental differences between Māori and Western worldviews, offering instead a vision grounded in tikanga Māori andrangatiratanga (sovereignty).

This work is essential reading for anyone seeking to understand the continuing impacts of colonization in New Zealand and the intellectual foundations of Māori sovereignty movements. It provides both a devastating critique of colonial legal frameworks and a compelling articulation of Māori ways of being and knowing that offer alternatives to Western models.

## Core Insights

### The Imposter Legal System
Mikaere exposes how New Zealand's legal system operates as an imposter that masquerades as neutral while fundamentally serving colonial interests. She argues that the system was never designed to deliver justice to Māori but rather to legitimize the theft of land and the suppression of Māori sovereignty. This is evident in how the legal education system, even in supposedly bicultural institutions like Waikato Law School, continues to marginalize Māori perspectives and place Māori students and staff in vulnerable positions.

> "Like the karanga during a pōwhiri on the marae a preface is the first voice that is heard in a book, and like the tauparapara of a whaikōrero it is meant to summarise and set the tone for whatever wit and wisdom might follow."

**Quick Take**: The legal system cannot be reformed to serve Māori interests because its very foundation is the denial of Māori sovereignty.

### Colonisation as Genocide
Mikaere boldly characterizes the impact of colonization on Māori as genocide, pointing to the 80% population decline between 1840 and 1896. She argues that this genocide continues through policies that seek to assimilate Māori into Pākehā norms and values, effectively completing the colonial project by eliminating Māori distinctiveness. The "Closing the Gaps" policy, for instance, measures Māori success against Pākehā standards rather than recognizing Māori concepts of wellbeing.

> "Turia could scarcely be accused of exaggeration in her characterisation of an 80 percent population decline as genocide."

**Quick Take**: Contemporary policies that measure Māori success by Pākehā standards represent a continuation of colonial genocide through assimilation.

### The Treaty Truth-Telling
One of Mikaere's most powerful contributions is her distinction between Te Tiriti o Waitangi (the Māori text) and the Treaty of Waitangi (the English text). She argues that these are fundamentally different documents that cannot be "read together" as courts often claim. Te Tiriti affirmed Māori rangatiratanga while delegating kāwanatanga (governance) to the Crown over British subjects, whereas the Treaty falsely claims Māori ceded sovereignty. Only 39 signatures were obtained for the English Treaty compared to over 500 for Te Tiriti.

> "Apart from the fact that the latter two documents happen to have been drafted and circulated during the same time period, they have absolutely nothing in common with each other."

**Quick Take**: The legal fiction that Te Tiriti and the Treaty can be reconciled serves to legitimize the theft of Māori sovereignty.

### Racism as Pākehā Problem
Mikaere reframes racism not as a Māori problem to be endured but as a Pākehā problem rooted in guilt and insecurity about the illegitimacy of their presence on Māori land. She identifies various Pākehā strategies for avoiding this truth: selective amnesia about history, denial of colonial violence, claims of victimhood when Māori seek redress, and the obsession with "moving forward" without addressing past wrongs.

> "Despite the fact that Māori have suffered and continue to suffer a great deal as a result of Pākehā racism, racism in Aotearoa is, however, still essentially a Pākehā problem."

**Quick Take**: The burden of addressing racism falls on Pākehā, who must confront their position as beneficiaries of colonial injustice.

### Tikanga Māori as Alternative Framework
Throughout the book, Mikaere presents tikanga Māori not as historical artifact but as living, evolving systems of knowledge and practice that offer alternatives to Western frameworks. She explores concepts like whakapapa as comprehensive ways of understanding the world that emphasize relationships rather than individualism, collective rights rather than just individual rights, and balance with the natural world rather than dominion over it.

> "Our sovereign authority in Aotearoa is sourced in the simple fact of our having been here for over a thousand years, in our having developed an intimate connection with this environment and an intricate web of relationships to regulate our place within it."

**Quick Take**: Māori knowledge systems provide sophisticated frameworks for organizing society that predate and could replace colonial models.

## Questions to Consider

- How might New Zealand's legal and political systems change if Te Tiriti rather than the Treaty was recognized as the founding document?
- What would it mean for Pākehā to genuinely confront their position as beneficiaries of colonial injustice rather than denying or minimizing it?
- How might tikanga Māori concepts like whakapapa and collective rights transform our understanding of issues ranging from environmental protection to economic organization?
- In what ways do contemporary policies continue the colonial project of assimilation despite appearing to address Māori concerns?
- How might Māori and non-Māori build genuine partnerships based on mutual respect rather than on Pākehā domination?

## Conclusion

This is a challenging but essential read that exposes uncomfortable truths about New Zealand's colonial foundations and their continuing impacts. Mikaere combines rigorous legal analysis with personal experience to create a work that is both intellectually powerful and emotionally resonant. While some readers may find her characterization of colonization as genocide confronting, this framing accurately captures the devastating impact of European settlement on Māori populations and the ongoing nature of colonial violence through assimilationist policies.

The book's greatest strength lies in how it moves beyond critique to articulate positive alternatives based in Māori knowledge systems. By presenting tikanga not as historical curiosity but as living, evolving frameworks, Mikaere offers glimpses of how Aotearoa might be organized differently—on foundations of mutual respect rather than Pākehā dominance, relationship rather than individualism, and balance with the natural world rather than exploitation.

This work is particularly valuable for readers interested in Indigenous sovereignty, decolonization, postcolonial theory, or New Zealand history. It challenges fundamental assumptions about law, property, rights, and progress while offering sophisticated alternatives rooted in Māori ways of knowing and being.
