# Don't Get a Job, Build a Business
**Authors**: Joan Baker, Joanne Hession | **Year**: 2013 | **Category**: Business & Finance

## Summary

This book challenges aspiring entrepreneurs to shift from being self-employed (having a job) to becoming true business owners (building wealth-creating assets). The authors argue that most people who think they're running businesses are actually just employing themselves, working long hours for limited returns. Real business ownership requires building an enterprise that can operate independently, generate sustainable wealth, and provide financial freedom.

**Who should read this**: Aspiring entrepreneurs, small business owners feeling stuck in day-to-day operations, self-employed professionals wanting to scale, and anyone seeking to create wealth through business rather than traditional employment. **What you'll gain**: A clear framework for transforming your mindset and business model from a job-like operation into a valuable, scalable asset.

## Core Insights

### The Business Owner vs. Self-Employed Mindset
The fundamental distinction between self-employed individuals and true business owners lies in their approach to income, time, and growth. Self-employed people trade time for money and focus on immediate survival, while business owners reinvest profits to develop capital and build lasting value. Business owners work strategically on their business rather than being trapped working in it, focusing on systems, growth, and creating something that can eventually operate without their constant involvement.

> _Original: "The business runs the self-employed person, while the business owner runs the business."_

**Quick Take**: Assess whether you're building a job or a business by asking: "If I stopped working for 3 months, would my business continue generating revenue?"

### Three Paths to Wealth Through Business
The book outlines three clear strategies for achieving financial freedom through business ownership. First, build a valuable business and sell it for a substantial sum. Second, develop a business that delivers profits without your daily involvement through systems and delegation. Third, create a business that generates strong cash flows and strategically extract those profits while maintaining the enterprise. Each path requires different mindsets and approaches, but all demand building a business that works independently of your personal time investment.

> _Original: "Creating a business that creates wealth and freedom differentiates the business owner from the self-employed person – they have a business, not a job."_

**Quick Take**: Choose your wealth strategy early—build-to-sell, build-to-delegate, or build-for-cash—because each requires different business structures and decisions.

### Working On vs. Working In Your Business
Most entrepreneurs get trapped doing technical work rather than strategic business building. True business owners dedicate specific time to planning, system development, and growth strategies. They protect time for strategic thinking, delegate or outsource non-essential activities, and focus on high-impact tasks that move the business forward. This requires conscious time management, setting boundaries around operational work, and developing the discipline to step back from daily tasks to work on long-term business development.

**Quick Take**: Schedule weekly strategic thinking time where you work exclusively on your business—not in it.

### Building a Wealth-Creating Asset
A true business is an asset that generates wealth independently of your time, not just a vehicle for your personal income. This means developing goodwill through brand reputation, customer lists, competent staff, supplier relationships, and systems that make the business valuable beyond your personal involvement. The focus shifts from immediate income to building long-term value that could eventually be sold or operated without you.

> "Business creation is not just about one job for one person, it's about building a wealth-creating asset that delivers value and employment for the owner and for others."
> _Original: "Business creation is not just about one job for one person, it's about building a wealth-creating asset that delivers value and employment for the owner and for others."_

**Quick Take**: Make decisions based on whether they increase your business's asset value, not just your immediate income.

### Network is Net Worth
Business success depends heavily on who you know, not just what you know. Strategic networking across different industries and communities creates opportunities, partnerships, and insights that can accelerate business growth. The authors emphasize building diverse relationships, joining appropriate professional associations, and developing genuine connections that go beyond transactional networking. Your network becomes a valuable business asset that provides access to knowledge, opportunities, and resources.

**Quick Take**: Map your current network and identify gaps—then strategically build relationships in areas that will grow your business.
