# The Art of Reading Difficult Books
**Original Title**: 難解な本を読む技術 (光文社新書)
**Authors**: Akinori Takada | **Year**: 2009 

## Summary
"The Art of Reading Difficult Books" presents reading as a technical skill that can be systematically learned and improved. Takada argues that reading is not a passive activity of receiving information, but an active practice of internalizing knowledge and thoughts from others. The book provides a structured methodology for tackling challenging philosophical and theoretical works that many readers find intimidating.

This guide is essential for students, academics, and serious readers who want to engage with complex philosophical texts, academic papers, or classical literature but feel overwhelmed by their difficulty. Readers will learn to transform confusion into understanding through systematic preparation, strategic reading approaches, and effective note-taking techniques.

## Core Insights

### Reading as a Technical Skill
The fundamental premise is that reading difficult books is not an innate talent but a learnable technique. Most people never receive formal instruction in "reading technology" beyond basic literacy, yet advanced reading requires specific methods and approaches.

> "Reading is not the passive act of 'receiving information' but the active practice of taking the knowledge and thoughts expressed there and making them your own."
> _Original: 「読書というのは決して『情報を受け取る』という受動的な営みなのではなく、そこに表現されている知識や思想を、自分の内部に取り込むという能動的な営みです。」_

**Quick Take**: Treat challenging reading like learning any skill - with patience, practice, and proper technique rather than expecting immediate comprehension.

### Understanding True Understanding
"Understanding" means being able to "use" the concepts presented in a text. If you can't imagine applying an idea to solve problems or explain situations, you haven't truly understood it. This practical definition helps gauge genuine comprehension versus false familiarity.

> "When you feel you've understood something while reading, it means you've become able to 'use' the concepts written there."
> _Original: 「本を読んでいると、理解したと感じることがありますが、それはそこに書かれている概念を『使う』ことができるようになったということを意味しています。」_

**Quick Take**: Test your understanding by asking how you would apply each concept in real situations.

### Book Types: Mountain-Climbing vs. Hiking
Different books require different reading strategies. "Mountain-climbing" books (like Wittgenstein's *Tractatus*) build concepts cumulatively - each step depends on mastering the previous one. "Hiking" books (like Derrida's work) present various concepts and arguments you can explore more freely.

> "Mountain-climbing books require you to step-by-step climb the stairs of conceptual understanding. Hiking books focus more on enjoying the scenery along the journey rather than reaching a summit."
> _Original: 「登山型の本は、概念の理解という階段を一歩一歩登って行かなくては理解することができないというタイプです。ハイキング型は、どこかの山の頂上に到達することよりも、『その途中の行程での景色を楽しむ』ことに主眼が置かれている。」_

**Quick Take**: Identify the book type early and adjust your reading strategy - sequential mastery for mountain-climbing, exploratory engagement for hiking.

### Closed vs. Open Books
"Closed" books present clear arguments and conclusions, allowing readers to follow along more passively. "Open" books deliberately hide the author's position, inviting readers to construct their own understanding. This distinction determines whether you should primarily absorb or actively engage.

> "Open books expect readers' active opinion-building, hiding much of their own thinking to provide groundwork for readers' own thoughts."
> _Original: 「『開いている本』とは、読者の積極的な意見構築を期待するために、著者が自らの考えを少なからず隠蔽しているタイプの本のことを指します。」_

**Quick Take**: Closed books = absorb first, question later. Open books = question and build understanding simultaneously.

### The Two-Stage Reading Method
The core technique involves reading each challenging book twice. First reading creates a "map of what you don't understand" through quick survey with rough notes. Second reading fills in details by stopping at difficult points and working through them systematically.

> "First reading creates a map of what you don't understand. Second reading fills in the details by stopping at difficult points and working through them."
> _Original: 「一度目の読みで作る地図とは、『わからないことの地図』です。二度目の読みでは、一度目の読みで作った読書ノートを横に置きながら読んでいくのがよいでしょう。」_

**Quick Take**: Don't expect full understanding on first read - use it to create your learning roadmap for the second pass.

### Reading Notes as Knowledge Containers
Takada emphasizes creating structured reading notebooks before, during, and after reading. Reserve one notebook per book, divide it by chapters, and use it to build "knowledge containers" that organize information systematically.

> "Reading notes create the framework for knowledge containers. Knowledge is efficiently acquired when containers are prepared to store it."
> _Original: 「読書ノートを作る」という作業は、知識を格納するための容器が準備されているときに効率的に習得されるのだ、ということを意識して作業を進めることが大事です。」_

**Quick Take**: Create structured notes before reading - outline chapters, leave space for concepts, and track what you don't understand.

### Assimilative vs. Critical Reading
"Assimilative reading" involves temporarily suspending disbelief to understand the author's perspective fully. "Critical reading" approaches texts skeptically, looking for problems and limitations. Takada recommends starting with assimilative reading for difficult classics.

> "Assimilative reading's basic principle is not to doubt. Believe that everything written in the book serves some purpose and try to understand it."
> _Original: 「同化読みの基本的方針は、疑わないということです。その本のどのページに書かれていることも、必ずある目的のために書かれているものだと信じ、それを理解しようとするという態度を貫くという方法です。」_

**Quick Take**: First understand books on their own terms, then critique them from your perspective.

## Action Items

- **Pre-reading research**: Spend 3+ hours researching the book, author, and field before reading
- **Create reading notebooks**: Set up structured outlines before starting each book
- **Master "shelf-scanning"**: Visit bookstores and browse entire sections to build knowledge maps
- **Practice two-stage reading**: First pass maps difficulties, second pass resolves them
- **Choose your attitude**: Decide between assimilative vs. critical reading before starting
- **Track your confusion**: Mark difficult passages and work systematically to understand them
- **Apply concepts**: Test understanding by imagining how to use each idea in practice
- **Join reading communities**: Discuss difficult texts with others to deepen comprehension

## Questions to Consider

- What books have you avoided because they seemed too difficult? How could this approach help?
- Are you currently a "mountain climber" or "hiker" reader? How does this affect your book choices?
- Do you tend toward assimilative or critical reading? When might each approach serve you best?
- How could you create better "knowledge containers" for what you read?
- What difference would it make to approach reading as a technical skill rather than innate ability?
- Which "sleeping thoughts" from past readings might be ready to awaken with new techniques?

## Conclusion
This book is absolutely worth your time if you regularly encounter challenging texts or want to expand your intellectual horizons. Takada demystifies the reading of difficult books by breaking it down into learnable techniques rather than mysterious talents.

The biggest reason to read this book is its practical, systematic approach that transforms reading from frustrating confusion into manageable skill-building. While the techniques require patience and practice, they unlock access to some of humanity's most profound thoughts that might otherwise remain inaccessible.

Even if you only apply a few of these methods, you'll find yourself approaching difficult texts with confidence rather than dread. The book's greatest strength is making the reading of challenging books feel like an achievable adventure rather than an impossible burden.
