Author: Kensuke Watanabe

## Problem-Solving Kid Basics
- You're Never Too Old to Become a Problem-Solving Kid:
  - This book emphasizes that anyone, regardless of age, can adopt a problem-solving mindset.
  - Problem-solving kids are those who face challenges head-on and have the ability to think critically, make decisions, and take proactive actions to overcome obstacles.
  - They come in all ages and backgrounds, and they possess the skill to think, act, and live proactively.
  - Problem-solving kids have learned how to tackle problems and have acquired useful problem-solving tools along the way.
- Problem-Solving Kids and Company:
  - The book introduces characters that represent common attitudes that hinder effective problem solving.
  - Miss Sigh gives up easily when facing challenges, blaming others and feeling sorry for herself.
  - Mr. Critic criticizes without contributing to solutions, avoiding responsibility.
  - Miss Dreamer comes up with ideas but fails to execute them, satisfied with just dreaming.
  - Mr. Go-Getter takes action quickly but often lacks thoughtful planning and consideration.
  - Problem-solving kids strike a balance between thinking and acting, focusing on goals and effective solutions.
  - They learn from both successes and failures, using a toolkit that includes identifying root causes, setting goals, and staying positive.
- What is Problem Solving?
  - Problem solving is a systematic process comprising four steps: understanding the current situation, identifying the root cause of the problem, developing an effective action plan, and executing the plan while making necessary modifications.
  - These steps work together as a package, involving both thinking and acting.
  - The process involves breaking down complex problems into smaller manageable components to find effective solutions.
  - Problem solving is a combination of critical thinking and action, aiming to overcome challenges and achieve desired outcomes.
- Problem-Solving Tool Box: Logic Tree:
  - A logic tree is a visual tool that aids in identifying root causes and generating various solutions.
  - It involves breaking down a problem into categories without overlap or exclusion.
  - It helps in systematically exploring options and finding effective solutions.
  - Logic trees start with a central problem and branch out to various categories and subcategories, grouping similar topics together.
  - They provide a structured approach to problem solving, encouraging a comprehensive and organized exploration of potential solutions.
  - Logic trees are a valuable tool for problem-solving kids, allowing them to think beyond initial ideas and generate innovative solutions.

## Rock Bands and Root Causes
- Potential Root Causes of the Problem:
  - Lack of awareness about the Mushroom Lovers' concert
  - Limited appeal to potential concert-goers
  - Ineffective communication methods
- Hypothesis for Likely Root Cause:
  - The lack of awareness about the concert and limited appeal might be contributing to the low attendance.
- Analyses and Information Required to Test Hypothesis:
  - Interviews with potential concert-goers to understand their preferences and reasons for attending concerts
  - Analysis of past concert attendance data and reasons for attendance or non-attendance
  - Evaluation of communication methods used to promote the concert
- Analysis and Identification of the Root Cause:
  - Interviews revealed that people were unaware of the concert and needed more enticing reasons to attend.
  - Examination of past concert data showed that attendance increased when people were exposed to the band's music.
- Develop a Wide Variety of Solutions to Solve the Problem:
  - Create a logic tree to brainstorm communication methods: newspapers, magazines, message boards, e-mail, radio, etc.
  - Explore options beyond personal communication to reach a wider audience.
  - Focus on not only raising awareness but also making people want to attend the concert.
- Prioritize the Actions:
  - Criteria for prioritization: impact of the action and ease of implementation.
  - Solutions with high impact and easy implementation are prioritized.
  - Solutions with high impact but hard implementation are considered next.
  - Solutions with low impact and easy implementation are also considered.
  - Solutions with low impact and hard implementation are least attractive.
- Develop an Implementation Plan:
  - Seek help from others with specific skills (e.g., art for poster creation).
  - Collaborate with classmates to create a CD or a website.
  - Prioritize actions based on criteria and seek assistance accordingly.
  - By leveraging others' strengths, all thirteen ideas can be pursued.
  - The implementation plan involves using strengths of different individuals to execute ideas effectively.

## Fishy Goals and Solid Achievements
- Deconstructing an Ambitious Aspiration into Manageable Milestones:
  - Problem-solving-oriented youngsters break down substantial dreams into smaller, attainable benchmarks.
  - They establish lesser objectives that serve as navigational points on the trajectory toward their grander visions.
  - These incremental accomplishments serve as steadfast wellsprings of motivation and maintain their unwavering focus.
- Formulating a Well-Defined Objective:
  - A well-defined goal possesses specificity, temporal confines, and encompasses explicit conditions.
  - Illustration: "Procure a previously owned Apple computer worth $500 within half a year, devoid of external monetary assistance."
- Assessing the Disparity Between the Desired Goal and Current Circumstance:
  - Discern the gap that exists between the prevailing circumstances and the coveted objective.
  - Evaluate the magnitude of the gap—whether it is modest or extensive—and deliberate on the optimal strategy to bridge it.
- Enumerating a Plethora of Alternatives and Notions to Bridge the Gap:
  - Embark on an intensive ideation process, conceiving a broad spectrum of well-defined ideas to surmount the objective.
  - Harness a structured logic tree to explore assorted branches of conceivable solutions.
  - Distinguish practical and efficacious concepts from those that lack feasibility.
- Opting for the Most Favorable Notions as Your Working Hypothesis:
  - Prune the roster of concepts to pinpoint the most feasible and efficacious propositions.
  - Discard ideas that do not hold practicality, effectiveness, or alignment with core values.
  - Formulate a hypothesis grounded in the most promising ideas for effectuating the desired objective.
- Identifying the Required Analyses and Information to Test the Hypothesis:
  - Draft a roadmap delineating the analyses and requisite data to validate the formulated hypothesis.
  - Assemble pertinent data and information to either corroborate or refute the formulated hypothesis.
- Analyzing and Crafting an Action Blueprint:
  - Subject the amassed data to comprehensive analysis to refine the blueprint and make judicious determinations.
  - Devising a matrix or hierarchical system to rank actions based on their projected impact and feasibility.
  - Engineer an action blueprint characterized by its adeptness at addressing the detected gap with strategic precision.
  - For instance, scrutinizing spending patterns to curtail superfluous expenditures and bolster savings.
  - Appraising the viability of liquidating assets to generate supplementary income.
  - Exploring and evaluating opportunities for transitioning to a more remunerative occupation.

## Soccer School Pros and Cons
- Problem-Solving Tool Box: Pros and Cons; Criteria and Evaluation
  - Tool 1: Pros and Cons
    - Pros and Cons tool helps evaluate options by considering both positive and negative aspects before making decisions.
    - Step 1: List all options, e.g., schools to choose from.
    - Step 2: List pros and cons of each option to avoid bias and consider all aspects.
    - Step 3: Assign weight to each pro and con, indicating their importance.
    - Step 4: Select the most attractive option based on weighted pros and cons.
  - Tool 2: Criteria and Evaluation
    - Criteria and Evaluation tool clarifies qualifications for evaluation, determines their importance, and assesses options effectively.
    - Step 1: List all options, e.g., schools.
    - Step 2: List evaluation criteria, e.g., quality of education, study abroad availability, cost, etc.
    - Step 3: Assign importance level to each criterion.
    - Step 4: Evaluate each option based on weighted criteria using a three-level evaluation method.
    - Step 5: Select the most attractive option considering criteria weights.
