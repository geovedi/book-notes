# In the Land of Invented Languages
**Author**: Arika Okrent | **Year**: 2009
**Category**: Philosophy & Critical Thinking

## Summary
"In the Land of Invented Languages" is a fascinating exploration of the 900+-year history of artificial languages, from medieval mystical tongues to modern Klingon. Linguist Arika Okrent takes readers on a journey through the ambitions, eccentricities, and ultimate failures of language inventors who dreamed of creating perfect communication systems—only to discover that language's "flaws" are actually its greatest strengths.

This book appeals to language enthusiasts, history buffs, and anyone curious about why human communication works the way it does. Readers will gain a deeper appreciation for natural language's organic complexity and the remarkable human drive to perfect even our most fundamental tools.

## Core Insights

### 1. The Illusion of Language "Perfection"
For centuries, inventors have tried to "fix" natural language by eliminating irregularities, ambiguities, and inefficiencies. From Hildegard von Bingen's 12th-century Lingua Ignota to 20th-century logical languages, these creators believed language was an engineering problem with a perfect solution. They were wrong.

> "The history of invented languages is, for the most part, a history of failure."

Okrent reveals that language's supposed flaws—irregular verbs, multiple meanings, idioms—are actually features that make communication more flexible, expressive, and human. The plastic flower analogy says it all: you can design something that looks perfect, but without organic roots, it won't grow.

**Quick Take**: Language evolved the way it did for good reasons; attempts to "improve" it misunderstand how communication actually works.

### 2. The Three Motivations Behind Language Invention
Okrent identifies three driving forces behind artificial languages:

**Auxiliary languages** (like Esperanto) aimed for world peace through universal communication, believing shared language would end conflicts. Creator Ludwik Zamenhof dreamed of "a linguistic handshake" between all peoples.

**Philosophical languages** (like John Wilkins' 1668 system) sought to reveal the true structure of reality by perfectly categorizing every concept. If you could say something perfectly, you could think it perfectly.

**Artistic languages** (like Tolkien's Elvish or modern Klingon) serve creative or community-building purposes, prioritizing aesthetic satisfaction over utility.

**Quick Take**: Every invented language reflects its creator's worldview—whether utopian, logical, or artistic.

### 3. Why Esperanto Came Closest to Success
Among hundreds of attempts, only Esperanto achieved modest success with thousands of speakers worldwide. Okrent shows this happened despite—not because of—its technical merits. Zamenhof's creation succeeded through:

- **Timing**: Emerging during the late 19th-century wave of internationalism
- **Accessibility**: Relatively simple grammar (though not as regular as claimed)
- **Community**: Early adopters who built social structures around the language
- **Idealism**: Tapping into genuine desires for cross-cultural understanding

Yet even Esperanto failed as a world language because people don't adopt languages for logical reasons—they learn them for community, economic opportunity, or cultural connection.

**Quick Take**: Language adoption is social, not linguistic; the best language doesn't win—people join languages that already have speakers.

### 4. The Klingon Miracle: When Success Means Something Different
The most remarkable modern story is Klingon—a language deliberately designed to be difficult and alien, yet it successfully developed actual speakers. Okrent, initially skeptical, becomes convinced at a Klingon conference where people genuinely communicate in this "unnatural" tongue.

Klingon succeeded where hundreds of "better" languages failed because it:

- **Had no practical ambitions**: Nobody expected world peace from Klingon
- **Built community first**: Star Trek fans created the social infrastructure
- **Embraced difficulty**: Learning Klingon became an achievement, not a utility
- **Served identity needs**: Speaking Klingon marked you as part of an in-group

> "So-called normal society spends all these resources figuring out new and exciting ways to drape cloth on our bodies. What's so bad about having fun with this little language?"

**Quick Take**: Languages succeed when they serve human needs for belonging, play, and identity—not when they're "perfect."

### 5. What Language Invention Teaches Us About Natural Language
The grand experiment of 900 years of language invention reveals profound truths about how natural language actually works:

**Ambiguity isn't a bug—it's flexibility**: The same word meaning multiple things allows for poetry, humor, and creative expression.

**Irregularity isn't chaos—it's history**: Irregular verbs are linguistic fossils that tell the story of how language evolved.

**Rules aren't constraints—they're tools**: Grammar provides structure while leaving room for innovation and change.

Most importantly, Okrent shows that language succeeds because it's messy, organic, and constantly changing—qualities that language inventors tried desperately to eliminate.

**Quick Take**: Language's "imperfections" are actually what make it beautifully adaptable and deeply human.

## Best Quotes
- "If you plant a plastic flower, will it grow?"
- "The history of invented languages is, for the most part, a history of failure."
- "So-called normal society spends all these resources figuring out new and exciting ways to drape cloth on our bodies. What's so bad about having fun with this little language?"
- "A consciously invented language that had been brought to life."
- "Language refuses to be cured and why it succeeds, not in spite of, but because of, the very qualities that the language inventors have tried to engineer away."

## Action Items
- **Appreciate linguistic diversity**: Recognize that natural languages' complexity is a feature, not a flaw
- **Learn from Esperanto's community**: When learning any language, focus on building social connections rather than just mastering grammar
- **Embrace communication imperfection**: Don't let fear of saying something "wrong" prevent you from speaking
- **Notice language's organic nature**: Pay attention to how slang, dialects, and new words emerge naturally in your own communities

## Questions to Consider
- If you could design a perfect language, what would you prioritize—logical consistency, ease of learning, or expressive richness?
- Why do we expect language to follow engineering principles when it's actually a living, evolving system?
- What role does imperfection play in other human institutions besides language?
- How might understanding why invented languages fail help us understand why social reforms succeed or fail?

## Conclusion
This book is absolutely worth your time if you've ever wondered why language works the way it does—or marveled at human ambition's delightful absurdity. Okrent's blend of linguistic expertise, storytelling skill, and genuine affection for her eccentric subjects makes what could have been a dry catalog of failures into a profound meditation on human communication itself.

The biggest reason to read it? You'll never look at "imperfect" natural language the same way again. Those irregular verbs, confusing idioms, and inexplicable exceptions aren't bugs to be fixed—they're the living evidence of language's glorious, messy humanity. In trying to perfect language, these inventors taught us why its imperfections make it beautiful.

And who knows? After reading about Klingon speakers proudly "scaring the mundanes," you might even find yourself inspired to join a community that finds joy in the beautifully unnecessary.
