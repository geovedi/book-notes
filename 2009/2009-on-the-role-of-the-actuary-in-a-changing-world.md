# On the Role of the Actuary in a Changing World
**Authors**: John R. Gordon BSc FIA | **Year**: 2009
**Category**: Business & Finance

## Summary
This provocative critique examines the actuarial profession's purpose and direction in the context of the 2008 financial crisis and changing global priorities. Gordon argues that while the world desperately needs actuaries' skills and expertise, the profession is failing to serve the long-term public interest due to commercial conflicts, outdated thinking, and risk-averse governance.

Written as both a wake-up call and a challenge to complacency, the book reveals how the profession's current strategy is unfit for modern challenges. It examines systemic flaws in financial markets, the limitations of traditional risk management, and the urgent need for actuaries to redirect their intellectual capital toward broader societal issues rather than narrow commercial interests.

This essential read offers actuaries and financial professionals a candid assessment of their profession's shortcomings and provides a roadmap for restoring credibility, independence, and public value in an increasingly volatile world.

## Core Insights

### The Profession at a Crossroads
Gordon argues that the actuarial profession faces an existential crisis, having failed to anticipate or adequately respond to the 2008 financial collapse. The profession has become too focused on serving commercial interests rather than the public good, creating what Gordon describes as a "morally compromising" debt to society. This conflict between member interests and public obligations has damaged the profession's credibility exactly when its expertise is most needed.

> "Every man is a debtor to his Profession, it is equally true that every Profession is also a debtor to society – and in that respect, I regret to say, my Profession's debt is presently running at levels that I find morally compromising."

**Quick Take**: The profession must rebalance its priorities toward public service or risk irrelevance.

### Failed Risk Management Paradigm
The book exposes how traditional actuarial methods failed spectacularly during the financial crisis, revealing that sophisticated mathematical models became substitutes for genuine judgment. Gordon argues that actuaries have been more effective at analyzing risks than managing them, and that the profession's risk management expertise is overstated given its inability to prevent or predict major financial catastrophes.

> "The past is no longer a guide to the future, and the sophistication of our financial models has long since ceased to be the limiting factor in equipping actuaries to expedite their responsibilities."

**Quick Take**: Actuaries must rely more on long-term vision and common sense than complex models based on failing paradigms.

### The Growth Delusion
Gordon challenges the fundamental assumption that economic growth should remain society's primary goal, arguing that this pursuit has become detrimental to long-term public interest. He describes how our current economic model is in direct conflict with priorities like sustainability and stability, and that the profession has been complicit in supporting this unsustainable agenda.

> "Our society is heading for a fall, and may be approaching a critical tipping point."

**Quick Take**: Actuaries should use their influence to support a shift toward sustainability and stability rather than growth and profit.

### Communication Breakdown
The profession suffers from poor public communication and media engagement, leaving it unable to contribute meaningfully to important policy debates. Gordon notes that actuaries often speak in terms others don't understand, and that the profession's absence from public discourse during the crisis represented a significant failure of its public interest obligations.

> "A popular criticism of our Profession over the years has been that its members often speak in terms that others do not understand."

**Quick Take**: Better public engagement and clearer communication are essential for rebuilding trust and influence.

### Governance Paralysis
The book reveals how the profession's governance structures support inertia even when majority support exists for change. Gordon uses the failed merger process as a case study in how the profession's decision-making criteria are unfit for a fast-changing world, preventing necessary adaptation and reform.

> "If there is another organisation that has talked more about change and delivered less, it is not one with which I am familiar."

**Quick Take**: Radical governance reform is needed to enable the profession to adapt quickly to changing circumstances.

## Best Quotes

- "These are times when the World needs actuaries, even if the World does not yet know it."

## Conclusion
This book is worth your time because it delivers exactly what its title promises - a candid examination of how the actuarial profession must adapt to remain relevant in a rapidly changing world. Gordon's willingness to challenge sacred cows and speak uncomfortable truths makes this essential reading for any actuary serious about their profession's future.

The biggest reason to read this book is its urgent call for professional renewal at a moment when actuarial skills are desperately needed to address systemic risks. Gordon compellingly argues that without fundamental change in approach, priorities, and mindset, the profession risks becoming increasingly irrelevant exactly when its expertise is most valuable.

While some may find Gordon's criticism harsh, his analysis provides a necessary corrective to professional complacency and a roadmap for restoring the actuarial profession's public value and credibility in an uncertain future.
