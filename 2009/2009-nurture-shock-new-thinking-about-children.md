# NurtureShock: New Thinking About Children
**Authors**: Po Bronson, Ashley Merryman | **Year**: 2009

## Summary
"NurtureShock" challenges conventional wisdom about child development by presenting cutting-edge scientific research that reveals how many modern parenting strategies are backfiring. The book demonstrates that our instincts about raising children are often wrong—not because they're not biologically driven, but because they're polluted by wishful thinking, outdated psychology, and moralistic biases.

This book is essential for parents, educators, and anyone who interacts with children, offering revolutionary insights that can transform how we nurture the next generation. Readers will gain evidence-based strategies that actually work rather than perpetuating counterintuitive practices that undermine children's development.

## Core Insights

### The Inverse Power of Praise
Telling children they're smart backfires by making them afraid of challenges. Carol Dweck's research revealed that children praised for intelligence choose easier tasks and give up quickly when faced with difficulty. Those praised for effort embrace challenges and persist through failure.

> "Emphasizing effort gives a child a variable that they can control. They come to see themselves as in control of their success."

**Quick Take**: Praise effort, not innate ability. Instead of "You're so smart," say "You worked really hard on this."

### The Lost Hour
Children get an hour less sleep than thirty years ago, with devastating consequences. Dr. Avi Sadeh's research showed that losing one hour of sleep reduces cognitive performance by two grade levels. Sleep deprivation affects IQ, emotional stability, ADHD symptoms, and even contributes to obesity.

> "A loss of one hour of sleep is equivalent to [the performance gap between] a normal fourth-grader and a normal sixth-grader."

**Quick Take**: Protect sleep time fiercely. One extra hour of sleep is more valuable than extra tutoring or activities.

### Why Kids Lie
Contrary to popular belief, children learn to lie earlier and more sophisticatedly than we realize. Dr. Victoria Talwar's research shows that adults (including police officers and customs officials) cannot reliably detect when children are lying, scoring no better than chance.

> "People simply cannot tell when kids are lying."

**Quick Take**: Create environments where telling the truth feels safer than lying. Focus on maintaining relationships rather than punishment.

### The Science of Teen Rebellion
Arguing with adults is actually a sign of respect, not disrespect. Research shows that teens who argue constructively with their parents are better at resisting peer pressure and have healthier relationships than those who avoid conflict entirely.

> "Why, for adolescents, arguing with adults is a sign of respect, not disrespect."

**Quick Take**: Encourage respectful debate rather than demanding blind obedience. Teaching teens to argue effectively teaches them critical thinking skills.

### Can Self-Control Be Taught?
While most school programs fail to change behavior (D.A.R.E. shows no long-term effect), one approach stands out: self-control can be taught through specific techniques that make abstract concepts concrete and immediate.

> "Human behavior is incredibly stubborn. We're hard to budge off our habits and proclivities."

**Quick Take**: Focus on developing executive functions through tools like private speech and self-regulation techniques rather than abstract lessons.

## Best Quotes
- "The central premise of this book is that many of modern society's strategies for nurturing children are in fact backfiring—because key twists in the science have been overlooked."
- "Our 'instincts' can be so off-base because they are not actually instincts."
- "When we praise children for their intelligence, we tell them that this is the name of the game: look smart, don't risk making mistakes."
- "Small corrections in our thinking today could alter the character of society long-term, one future-citizen at a time."

## Action Items
- **Praise effort over intelligence**: Replace "You're smart" with "You worked hard" to build resilience
- **Protect sleep hours**: One extra hour of sleep dramatically improves cognitive performance
- **Welcome respectful debate**: Teaching teens to argue effectively builds critical thinking skills
- **Focus on self-control tools**: Use concrete techniques rather than abstract moral lessons
- **Question conventional wisdom**: Many popular parenting strategies have no scientific backing

## Questions to Consider
- What "instincts" about children might actually be culturally learned biases rather than biological wisdom?
- How might our well-intentioned praise be undermining children's resilience and love of learning?
- Are we sacrificing sleep for activities that provide less developmental value?
- How can we create environments where children feel safe telling the truth?
- Are we teaching compliance rather than genuine moral reasoning?

## Conclusion
"NurtureShock" is worth your time because it challenges the very foundation of modern parenting wisdom with solid scientific evidence. The biggest reason to read this book is that it works—these aren't theoretical suggestions but practical strategies backed by rigorous research.

What makes this book essential is its willingness to follow the science wherever it leads, even when the conclusions contradict everything we thought we knew about raising children. The authors demonstrate that many of our sacred cows—from intelligence testing to self-esteem building programs—are not just ineffective but potentially harmful.

This book will fundamentally change how you think about children, making you more thoughtful, evidence-based, and ultimately more effective in nurturing the next generation. It's not a paint-by-numbers approach but a scientific framework for understanding what children actually need to thrive.
