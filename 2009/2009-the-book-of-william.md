## Core Insights

### The Accidental Treasure
The First Folio wasn't intended to be a masterpiece. Published by Shakespeare's fellow actors John Heminge and Henry Condell in 1623, it was a desperate effort to preserve 18 plays that existed only in handwritten manuscripts and would have been lost forever. What makes it extraordinary is not its original purpose, but how it survived centuries of neglect, becoming the most important secular work in English literature.

> "It's the most important work in English literature, and indeed the most important secular work of all time."

**Quick Take**: Great cultural treasures often begin as practical solutions to immediate problems.

### The Four Stages of Value Evolution
Collins traces the Folio's journey through four distinct phases of appreciation. First came neglect (17th-18th centuries), when it was considered old-fashioned and often rebound or cannibalized. Then scholarly resurrection (18th century), when editors like Theobald and Johnson recognized its literary importance. Next, collector's obsession (19th century) drove prices skyward and created facsimile markets. Finally, institutional preservation (20th-21st centuries) made it a global cultural heritage object.

> "In their hands, Shakespeare had become a national saint—and the First Folio his one true book."

**Quick Take**: Cultural value is socially constructed and evolves dramatically over time.

### The Obsession Economy
The book reveals how the Folio created an entire ecosystem of obsession. From George Steevens, who walked London daily visiting Folio copies, to Henry Clay Folger, the Standard Oil executive who amassed the world's largest collection, to Charlton Hinman, who invented new technology just to study the Folio's printing variants, the book has inspired remarkable human dedication.

> "From a single copy of Shakespeare's first collected works, a whole universe of scholarship, commerce, and pilgrimage has emerged."

**Quick Take**: Important artifacts generate their own economies of passion and expertise.

### Technology's Transformative Power
Each technological revolution reshaped the Folio's significance. The 18th-century printing press made Shakespeare accessible to masses. 19th-century photography created the first facsimiles. 20th-century collator technology allowed microscopic analysis of printing variations. Now digital preservation makes it simultaneously globally accessible and physically obsolete.

> "Shakespeare's words are beginning to slip the bonds of mere time and place—ascending into a new life, into new lands never dreamt of in all the philosophy of their makers."

**Quick Take**: Technology doesn't just preserve culture—it fundamentally changes how we value and access it.
