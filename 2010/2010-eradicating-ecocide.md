# Eradicating Ecocide
**Authors**: Polly Higgins | **Year**: 2010 | **Category**: Science & Nature

## Summary
"Eradicating Ecocide" presents a radical legal framework to address mass environmental destruction by proposing ecocide as the fifth Crime Against Peace, alongside genocide, crimes against humanity, war crimes, and crimes of aggression. Higgins, a barrister and environmental advocate, argues that current laws are inadequate to prevent corporations and governments from engaging in widespread ecosystem destruction, which she argues will inevitably lead to resource wars and planetary collapse.

The book demonstrates through examples like the Deepwater Horizon oil disaster that our current legal framework grants corporations the "right to kill" ecosystems without consequence. Higgins proposes making ecocide a crime of strict liability under international law, creating a preemptive legal duty to prevent environmental destruction rather than merely punishing it after the fact.

## Core Insights

### The Legal Definition of Ecocide
Higgins proposes ecocide as "the extensive destruction, damage to or loss of ecosystem(s) of a given territory, whether by human agency or by other causes, to such an extent that peaceful enjoyment by the inhabitants of that territory has been severely diminished." The definition covers both "non-ascertainable ecocide" (where the cause cannot be specifically attributed) and "ascertainable ecocide" (where liability can be determined).

> "Quite simply the laws and governance we need to prevent such a disaster from happening again do not exist. The law as it currently stands, is not fit for purpose. Instead BP have the 'right to kill' the ocean without consequence."

**Quick Take**: Current environmental laws treat destruction as a civil matter with fines, rather than a criminal matter requiring restoration and prevention.

### Ecocide as a Crime Against Peace
The book argues that ecocide should be added to the Rome Statute as the fifth Crime Against Peace, making it prosecutable by the International Criminal Court. This would establish it as an erga omnes obligation - a duty owed to the international community as a whole, similar to piracy and genocide.

> "For the purpose of international law, I propose the following definition for ecocide: the extensive destruction, damage to or loss of ecosystem(s) of a given territory, whether by human agency or by other causes, to such an extent that peaceful enjoyment by the inhabitants of that territory has been severely diminished."

**Quick Take**: By categorizing ecocide as a crime against peace, the framework recognizes that environmental destruction leads directly to conflict and war over remaining resources.

### Strict Liability and Corporate Responsibility
Higgins advocates for ecocide to be a crime of strict liability, meaning intent or mental state is irrelevant - only the act and its consequences matter. This shifts the focus from blame to prevention and ensures directors cannot hide behind corporate structures to avoid responsibility.

> "The proposed crime of ecocide is focused on prevention from the outset. It creates a quasi-crime, a regulatory offence, rather than an ordinary criminal offence."

**Quick Take**: Corporate directors would face personal criminal liability for ecocide, creating powerful incentives to prevent environmental damage.

### The Sacred Trust of Civilization
The book invokes UN Charter principles to argue that governments have a "sacred trust" to protect territories and inhabitants that cannot fully govern themselves - applying this principle to future generations and ecosystems that cannot speak for themselves.

> "The Sacred Trust of Civilization creates an obligation to promote to the utmost the well-being of the inhabitants of these territories."

**Quick Take**: This principle creates a legal duty for governments to protect both current inhabitants and future generations from environmental destruction.

### Eight Principles for Prevention
Higgins outlines specific legal and governance reforms: 1) Amend compromise treaties to prohibit destructive practices, 2) Prioritize community interests over corporate decisions, 3) Require community representation on corporate boards, 4) Mandate transparency and independent scrutiny, 5) Regulate corporate lobbying, 6) Hold governments accountable for damaging policies, 7) Ensure genuine public consultation, and 8) Rapid transition to clean solutions.

**Quick Take**: These principles create a comprehensive framework to prevent ecocide by rebalancing power from corporations to communities.

## Best Quotes

- "Instead BP have the 'right to kill' the ocean without consequence."
- "We literally have to derail this unstoppable train of destruction that we have created. Applying the brakes gently is not going to work."
- "Corporations are the ones gambling our planet away and our governments are running the casino."
- "Money is a useful tool of measurement; it assists us in quantifying the enormity of the damage and destruction caused. But to understand existence value is a step further – it demands a shift in thinking, one that does not subject the world to market measurements."
- "I resolved I would not rest until I had effected its abolition. He gave his whole life to achieve what he set out to do. If that's how long it will take for me to effect the abolition of ecocide, then that is what I committed to doing."

## Action Items

- **Investment Divestment**: Move pensions and investments from destructive industries to clean alternatives
- **Banking Choice**: Switch to banks with strong environmental policies and let current banks know why
- **Corporate Engagement**: Use shareholder power to demand environmental responsibility
- **Political Advocacy**: Pressure governments to support making ecocide a Crime Against Peace
- **Community Organizing**: Hold local meetings and demand genuine consultation on environmental decisions

## Questions to Consider

- How can we value ecosystems beyond their "service" to humanity while still making compelling economic arguments?
- What would our economy look like if corporate directors faced personal criminal liability for environmental destruction?
- How can Indigenous concepts of stewardship be incorporated into international law?
- What prevents governments from taking bold action to prevent ecocide, and how can these barriers be overcome?
- If not ecocide, what alternative legal frameworks could effectively prevent mass environmental destruction?

## Conclusion
"Eradicating Ecocide" is a crucial read for anyone seeking to understand how legal frameworks enable environmental destruction and how they might be reformed. Higgins' proposal to make ecocide a Crime Against Peace represents one of the most ambitious and potentially effective approaches to addressing climate change and biodiversity loss.

The book's strength lies in its comprehensive legal analysis and pragmatic approach to implementation. Rather than relying on voluntary corporate responsibility or market mechanisms, Higgins argues for binding legal obligations that would fundamentally change corporate incentives and government priorities. While the proposal may seem radical, it builds on existing international legal principles and provides a clear roadmap for implementation.

For policymakers, lawyers, environmental advocates, and concerned citizens, this book offers both a stark diagnosis of our legal failures and a hopeful prescription for transformation. Whether or not one agrees with every aspect of Higgins' proposal, the book succeeds in demonstrating that our current legal framework is grossly inadequate and that bold, systemic change is essential if we are to prevent planetary collapse.
