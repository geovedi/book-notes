**Authors**: Sam Kashner, Nancy Schoenberger | **Year**: 2010

## Summary
"Furious Love" chronicles the legendary, tumultuous relationship between Elizabeth Taylor and Richard Burton—the most famous love affair of the 20th century. Beginning with their scandalous meeting on the set of "Cleopatra" in 1962, the book follows their thirteen-year saga through two marriages, countless headlines, magnificent jewels, passionate fights, and international controversy. Their relationship transformed them from respected actors into the world's first celebrity couple, creating the modern template for tabloid culture and paparazzi frenzy. Despite their genuine, profound love for each other, their relationship was ultimately destroyed by the very publicity that created them, Burton's alcoholism, and their inability to escape the "Liz and Dick" spectacle they had become.

This intimate portrait reveals the private marriage behind the public spectacle, drawing from Taylor's personal collection of Burton's love letters and extensive interviews. It's essential reading for anyone fascinated by celebrity culture, classic Hollywood, or the destructive power of fame and passion.

## Core Insights

### The Birth of Modern Celebrity Culture
The Burton-Taylor affair essentially invented contemporary celebrity media. Their relationship on "Cleopatra" created such unprecedented international attention that it spawned the term "paparazzi" (from Fellini's "La Dolce Vita," inspired by the photographers who hounded the couple). They moved from entertainment pages to hard news, ranking alongside Kennedy and Khrushchev in headline coverage. The Vatican condemned Taylor's "erotic vagrancy," and U.S. congressmen called for them to be barred from re-entering America. Their relationship demonstrated that fame could be manufactured through scandal, creating a blueprint for future celebrity culture.

> "They had moved off the show biz pages and into the hard news. They were up there with Kennedy and Khrushchev and the Cuban missiles."

**Quick Take**: Their relationship marks the turning point when private lives became public spectacle and celebrity became a commodity.

### Two Marriages: Public vs. Private
The central tragedy was the conflict between "Liz and Dick" (the public brand) and "Richard and Elizabeth" (the private marriage). The yachts, jewels, lavish parties, and constant press attention overwhelmed their genuine connection. Taylor admitted there were "two marriages"—the ballyhooed union that captivated the world and the private partnership of two people trying to live together. When they attempted to reconnect years later in a stage production of "Private Lives," critics noted they had become caricatures of themselves, unable to escape the personas that had destroyed them.

> "More often than not, Liz and Dick overwhelmed the private marriage, holding it hostage and ultimately helping to destroy it."

**Quick Take**: Public personas can destroy private relationships when the spectacle becomes more important than the substance.

### The Chemistry of Fire and Ice
 Burton was initially drawn to Taylor as just another conquest, but found his match in her fierce sexuality and appetite for life. Taylor, in turn, was attracted to Burton's rough Welsh masculinity—his voice, intellect, and ability to stand up to her when others wouldn't. Burton recognized in Taylor "the embodiment of all the women in Wales he had loved or lusted after," while Taylor saw in Burton a younger version of her beloved Mike Todd. Their chemistry was immediate and overwhelming, both on and off screen, with Burton learning film acting from Taylor's natural camera presence while she gained from his theatrical technique.

> "From that first instant I saw you entering Rome on that fabulous beast, crowned in gold…I envied Caesar…I envied him you."

**Quick Take**: True chemistry happens when two people recognize in each other the fulfillment of their deepest longings.

### The Price of Passion
Both Burton and Taylor were addicted to drama, fighting, and reconciliation. Their relationship was characterized by violent arguments, extravagant drinking, and even suicide attempts when threatened with separation. Taylor once took an overdose of sleeping pills when Burton briefly returned to his wife Sybil, while Burton's jealousy and alcoholism created increasingly dangerous situations. Friends noted that they seemed to thrive on chaos, creating crises to experience the intensity of reconciliation. This pattern made their love unsustainable despite genuine affection.

> "I am forever punished by the gods for being given the fire and trying to put it out. The fire, of course, is you."

**Quick Take**: Relationships built on intensity and drama often burn out quickly, unable to sustain normal life.

### The Final Tragedy
Burton's death from a cerebral hemorrhage at age 58 left Taylor devastated. She was barred from attending his funeral by his widow Sally, but received his final love letter written just days before his death. Taylor kept that letter as her most cherished possession, believing they would have married a third time. In her later years, she reflected that Burton was "magnificent in every sense of the word" and that their bond continued until his final breath. The tragedy was that two people who truly loved each other could never find peace with their love.

> "In my heart, I will always believe we would have been married a third and final time…from those first moments in Rome we were always madly and powerfully in love."

**Quick Take**: Even true love can be destroyed by external pressures and internal demons.
