## Core Insights

### Roman Foundations: London's First Sex Trade
London's sexual commerce began with the Romans, who brought slave girls to service the military in lupanaria (brothels). These early establishments operated alongside bath houses, establishing a pattern of institutionalized vice that would persist for centuries. The Roman connection between sex and power set precedents that would influence London's sexual culture for millennia.

**Quick Take**: Even from its founding, London's sex trade was tied to conquest and commerce, establishing patterns that would repeat throughout history.

### Medieval Hypocrisy: Church and Brothels
Under Norman rule, prostitution flourished with remarkable official sanction. William the Conqueror himself profited from renting properties to brothel-keepers, while the Church's involvement reached surreal levels - St Mary Overie nunnery in Southwark became a celebrated brothel under the Bishop of Winchester's supervision. Streets like Cock's Lane, Maiden Lane, and the provocatively named "Gropecunt Lane" formed the medieval red-light district.

**Quick Take**: Moral hypocrisy has always been central to London's sex trade, with authorities publicly condemning while privately profiting from prostitution.

### Tudor Transformations: Theatre and Vice
When Henry VIII attempted to close the "stews" (brothels) in 1546 to combat syphilis, he inadvertently created a new dynamic. The flourishing theatre district on Bankside became intertwined with prostitution, as patrons of the Globe and Rose theatres frequented nearby brothels with colorful names like "Ye Boar's Hedde" and "The Cardinal's Cap."

**Quick Take**: Attempts to suppress vice often lead to its transformation rather than elimination, with commercial creativity finding new expressions.

### Geographic Patterns: The Geography of Sin
Throughout London's history, prostitution has migrated geographically but remained concentrated. From Southwark's medieval stews to Covent Garden's 18th-century "Square of Venus," from Victorian Soho to modern King's Cross, the trade has consistently found specific districts where it could flourish with minimal interference.

**Quick Take**: London's sexual geography follows predictable patterns of concentration and migration, adapting to urban development and policing strategies.

### Social Paradoxes: Regulation vs. Reality
The book reveals the persistent gap between official regulation and actual practice. Whether through medieval Church sanction, Tudor royal edicts, Victorian moral campaigns, or modern legislation, authorities have consistently failed to eliminate prostitution while often making it more dangerous for those involved.

**Quick Take**: The more society attempts to regulate or eliminate prostitution, the more it drives the trade underground and increases its dangers.
