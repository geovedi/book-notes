## Core Insights

### A Child's Eyewitness Account of Heaven
During emergency surgery, four-year-old Colton Burpo clinically nearly died from a burst appendix. When he later began describing his experience, his parents discovered he had vivid memories of visiting heaven—complete with details no one had told him. Colton described sitting on Jesus's lap, seeing angels sing to him, and watching events from an out-of-body perspective above the operating table while his father prayed and his mother made phone calls.

> "They sang 'Jesus Loves Me' and 'Joshua Fought the Battle of Jericho,' I asked them to sing 'We Will, We Will Rock You,' but they wouldn't sing that."

**Quick Take**: Children's accounts of spiritual experiences carry unique credibility because they're too innocent to fabricate complex theological details.

### Heaven is Real and Tangible
Colton described heaven as a vibrant, real place with physical characteristics: streets of gold, magnificent gates, and colorful rainbows. He met people who had died before him—including a miscarried sister he never knew existed and his grandfather who died 30 years before his birth. These encounters provided his parents with healing and confirmation of heaven's reality.

> "It doesn't get dark in heaven, Dad! Who told you that?"

**Quick Take**: Heaven is portrayed as a continuation of life in a perfected form, not an abstract spiritual concept but a real destination.

### Jesus Appears Exactly as He Is
Colton's descriptions of Jesus were both detailed and specific—brown hair, a beard, beautiful eyes, white robes with a purple sash, and a crown with a pink diamond. When shown various artistic depictions of Jesus, the four-year-old consistently rejected them as inaccurate. Years later, the family discovered that a young artist named Akiane Kramarik had painted a portrait called "Prince of Peace" that perfectly matched Colton's description.

> "Jesus has markers... And his eyes... oh, Dad, his eyes are so pretty!"

**Quick Take**: Our earthly attempts to depict Jesus may fall short of His actual appearance, but children's pure visions can offer remarkable insight.

### Family Continues in Heaven
Perhaps most comforting were Colton's encounters with deceased family members. He met his sister who died in his mother's womb before anyone had told him about this miscarriage. He also met his grandfather, who confirmed their family connection. These details provided profound healing and closure for the family, demonstrating that relationships continue in heaven.

> "She came up to me and said she's my sister. I have two sisters."

**Quick Take**: Heaven restores what was lost on earth and reunites family members across generations and time.

### You're Never Too Young for Ministry
Colton's experience became a ministry tool for others. When visiting elderly church members near death, Colton would comfort them by saying, "The first person you're going to see is Jesus," bringing peace to those facing the end of life. His simple childlike faith carried more weight than any adult's theological arguments.

> "It's going to be okay. The first person you're going to see is Jesus."

**Quick Take**: God can use anyone, regardless of age, to bring comfort and share His message of hope.
