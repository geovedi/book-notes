**Original Title**: Ontwaken in liefde: Het spirituele pad van een cursus in wonderen
**Author**: Margot Krikhaar | **Year**: 2010 | **Category**: Spirituality & Religion

## Summary
"Awakening in Love" is a deeply personal yet universally practical guide to navigating the spiritual path of A Course in Miracles. Margot Krikhaar shares her intimate journey from childhood trauma, through relationship struggles and burnout, to profound spiritual awakening. Written with the guidance of Jesus as her inner teacher, the book serves as both memoir and roadmap for others seeking to transform their suffering into awakening through the practice of forgiveness.

This book bridges the gap between the complex metaphysical teachings of A Course in Miracles and practical daily application. Krikhaar demonstrates how the Course's radical principles can transform ordinary suffering into profound peace, making it accessible for both beginners and experienced students of the Course.

## Core Insights

### The Journey from Victimhood to Forgiveness
The book begins with Krikhaar's childhood experience of nearly drowning, establishing a core pattern: feeling like a victim who needs to be rescued, yet resenting the need for help. This childhood trauma set up a lifelong pattern of trying to be self-sufficient while secretly feeling helpless. The Course teaches that our suffering comes from seeing ourselves as victims of others' actions, while forgiveness involves recognizing that nothing truly happened to us except our own mistaken perceptions.

> "The ego has made the world as it perceives it, but the Holy Spirit, Who reinterprets what the ego has made, sees the world as a teaching device to bring you home" (T5.III.11:1).
_Original: "Het ego heeft de wereld gemaakt zoals het die waarneemt, maar de Heilige Geest, die herinterpreteert wat het ego gemaakt heeft, ziet de wereld als een leermiddel om jou thuis te brengen"_

**Quick Take**: Your victim story is the starting point, not the destination. The Course invites you to see that what you thought others did to you is actually your own projection.

### The Recognition of Needing Help
A crucial turning point comes when we admit we cannot solve our problems alone. Krikhaar's burnout in 2006 became the portal through which she recognized her need for divine guidance. This surrender to help is the first step on the spiritual path, as it opens us to receiving the Holy Spirit's guidance rather than trying to figure everything out with our ego minds.

> "When I said: 'I am with you always,' I meant it literally. I am absent from no one in any situation" (T7.III.1:7,8).
_Original: "Toen ik zei: 'Ik ben altijd met jullie,' bedoelde ik dat letterlijk. Ik ben voor niemand in enige situatie afwezig"_

**Quick Take**: Admitting you need help isn't weakness—it's the beginning of true strength and the invitation for divine assistance to enter your life.

### Learning to Listen to Inner Guidance
The Course teaches we have two voices in our minds: the ego's voice of fear and attack, and the Holy Spirit's voice of love and peace. Learning to distinguish between them is crucial. The ego speaks first and loudest, often with anxiety or criticism. The Holy Spirit's guidance comes with peace, love, and inner certainty, even when the message is challenging.

**Practical ways to learn this distinction:**
- Notice whether guidance brings peace or anxiety
- Practice stillness and inner listening
- Be willing to "not know" and ask for help
- Watch for synchronicities and meaningful encounters
- Write with your inner teacher to clarify guidance

### The Practice of True Forgiveness
The Course's definition of forgiveness is radically different from traditional forgiveness. It's not about excusing harmful behavior or pardoning sins—it's about recognizing that what you thought happened never truly occurred in reality. Your brother is innocent because he is forever God's creation, regardless of appearances.

> "Forgiveness recognizes what you thought your brother did to you has not occurred" (WdII.1.1:1).
_Original: 'Vergeving ziet in dat wat jij dacht dat je broeder jou heeft aangedaan, niet heeft plaatsgevonden'_

**Quick Take**: True forgiveness looks past the dream of attack to the reality of love that never changed.

### Moving Beyond Special Relationships
Krikhaar painfully discovered how her relationships were based on getting love rather than giving it. The Course teaches that "special relationships" (those based on getting something from others) become barriers to awakening when transformed into "holy relationships" (those dedicated to mutual awakening). The shift comes when you stop trying to get love from others and instead see them as your path to awakening.

> "Whenever you meet anyone, remember it is a holy encounter. As you see him you will see yourself. As you treat him you will treat yourself" (T8.III.4:1-3).
_Original: "Telkens wanneer jij iemand ontmoet, bedenk dan dat het een heilige ontmoeting is. Zoals je hem ziet, zie jij jezelf. Zoals je hem behandelt, behandel jij jezelf"_

### The Willingness to Choose Again
The Course teaches that every moment offers a new choice: we can listen to the ego's voice of fear or the Holy Spirit's voice of love. This choice is always available, regardless of past mistakes. The key is developing "a little willingness" to choose differently.

> "I must have made a wrong choice, for I am not at peace. I made the choice myself, but I can also choose otherwise. I want to choose otherwise, because I want to be at peace" (T5.VII.6:7-9).
_Original: "Ik moet de verkeerde keuze hebben gemaakt, want ik ben niet in vrede. Ik heb die keuze zelf gemaakt, maar ik kan ook anders kiezen. Ik wil anders kiezen, omdat ik in vrede wil zijn"_

**Quick Take**: You don't need perfect consistency—just honest willingness to choose again in each moment.

## Best Quotes

- "Do not be afraid to look within. The ego tells you that inside is black with sin, and bids you not look. But it bids you look at your brothers instead, and see the sin in them"
  _Original: "Wees niet bang om naar binnen te kijken. Het ego vertelt je dat alles van binnen zwart ziet van schuld, en gebiedt jou niet te kijken. Daarentegen gebiedt het je naar je broeders te kijken, en de schuld in hen te zien"_

- "Would you not go through fear to love? For that seems to be the journey"
  _Original: "Wil je niet door de angst heen naar de liefde gaan? Want dat lijkt de reis te zijn"_

- "I must have made a wrong choice, for I am not at peace. I made the choice myself, but I can also choose otherwise. I want to choose otherwise, because I want to be at peace"
  _Original: "Ik moet de verkeerde keuze hebben gemaakt, want ik ben niet in vrede. Ik heb die keuze zelf gemaakt, maar ik kan ook anders kiezen. Ik wil anders kiezen, omdat ik in vrede wil zijn"_

- "Whenever you meet anyone, remember it is a holy encounter. As you see him you will see yourself. As you treat him you will treat yourself"
  _Original: "Telkens wanneer jij iemand ontmoet, bedenk dan dat het een heilige ontmoeting is. Zoals je hem ziet, zie jij jezelf. Zoals je hem behandelt, behandel jij jezelf"_

- "Healing is the release from fear of awakening and the substitution of it with the decision to awaken. The decision to awaken reflects the will to love, since all healing is the replacement of fear with love"
  _Original: 'Genezing is de bevrijding van de angst te ontwaken en de vervanging hiervan door de beslissing wakker te zijn. De beslissing wakker te zijn weerspiegelt de wil om liefde te hebben, aangezien alle genezing het vervangen van angst door liefde inhoudt'_

## Action Items

- **Start your day with willingness**: Begin each morning by saying you're willing to see things differently, to be guided, and to choose peace
- **Practice inner listening**: Take a few minutes daily to quiet your mind and ask for guidance, then notice what thoughts bring peace versus anxiety
- **Choose forgiveness in conflicts**: When upset with someone, remind yourself they're helping you see what needs forgiveness in your own mind
- **Transform special relationships**: Look at your close relationships and ask whether they're based on getting or giving love, then practice seeing the other as your path to awakening
- **Accept divine help**: When you feel overwhelmed or stuck, simply say "Help, Holy Spirit!" and be open to guidance coming through intuition, synchronicities, or inner knowing
