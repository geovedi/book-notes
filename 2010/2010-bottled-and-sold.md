# Bottled and Sold: The Story Behind Our Obsession with Bottled Water
**Authors**: Peter H. Gleick | **Year**: 2010

## Summary
"Bottled and Sold" exposes how the bottled water industry has systematically undermined public confidence in tap water while creating a massive environmental crisis through plastic waste. Gleick reveals that Americans consume 30 billion plastic water bottles annually, with consumers paying up to 2,000 times more for bottled water than safe tap water, despite studies showing most bottled water is simply repackaged municipal water.

This eye-opening investigation is essential for environmentally conscious consumers, public health advocates, and anyone concerned about corporate manipulation of public resources. Readers will gain the knowledge to make informed choices about water consumption and understand the broader implications of privatizing essential public resources.

## Core Insights

### The War on Tap Water
The bottled water industry has waged a sophisticated psychological campaign against tap water, using fear-based marketing to convince consumers that tap water is unsafe. Industry executives have openly declared tap water their "biggest enemy" and stated their goal to relegate it to "showers and washing dishes." This campaign has been remarkably successful: water fountains have disappeared from public spaces, and consumers now pay premium prices for something they could get nearly free from their taps.

> "When we're done, tap water will be relegated to showers and washing dishes."
> — Susan Wellington, president of Quaker Oats Company's beverage division

**Quick Take**: The disappearance of public water fountains isn't accidental—it's part of a deliberate strategy to create dependency on commercial water products.

### The Environmental Cost of Convenience
Every second, 1,000 plastic water bottles are discarded in the United States, creating mountains of waste that will persist for centuries. The production and transportation of bottled water generate massive carbon emissions, with some water brands traveling thousands of miles from source to consumer. The "convenience" of bottled water comes at an extraordinary environmental price that far outweighs its temporary benefits.

> "Eighty-five million bottles a day. More than thirty billion bottles a year at a cost to consumers of tens of billions of dollars."

**Quick Take**: True convenience would include considering the environmental impact of our choices, not just immediate ease of use.

### The Illusion of Purity
Contrary to marketing claims, approximately 40% of bottled water is actually filtered municipal tap water. FDA regulations for bottled water are often weaker than EPA standards for tap water, and numerous studies have found contaminants in bottled water that would violate tap water standards. The "purity" premium is largely a marketing construct rather than a scientific reality.

> "How can you be sure your water is safe? Take a closer look at the water in our glass. Can you tell if it's pure? Unfortunately, you can't."

**Quick Take**: The perceived safety advantage of bottled water is often based on marketing rather than measurable quality differences.

### The Global Water Injustice
While wealthy consumers pay premium prices for bottled water, over a billion people worldwide lack access to safe drinking water. The bottled water phenomenon creates a bizarre global dichotomy where suburban Americans lug cases of plastic water bottles to homes with unlimited safe tap water, while people in developing countries walk hours to collect contaminated water that causes illness and death.

> "Suburban shoppers in America lug cases of plastic water bottles from the grocery store back to homes supplied with unlimited piped potable water in a sad and unintentional parody of the labor of girls and women in Africa, who spend countless backbreaking hours carrying containers of filthy water from distant contaminated sources to homes with no water at all."

**Quick Take**: Our water choices have global implications that reflect and reinforce existing inequalities in access to this essential resource.

### The Third Water Age
We're transitioning from a "Second Water Age" of centralized public water systems to a "Third Water Age" that could go in two directions: either complete privatization of water through bottled products, or a "soft path" of sustainable, equitable public water management. The future of water depends on whether we choose to invest in public infrastructure or abandon it to commercial interests.

> "It is possible that we will look back in a few decades at a shortlived bottled water craze and wonder what we were thinking. But if we don't address our growing water crisis, we could just as easily look back wistfully at the era of safe, cheap, and reliable tap water as a golden age."

**Quick Take**: We're at a critical juncture where our choices about water consumption will shape the future of this essential resource.
