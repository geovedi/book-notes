# The Happiness Advantage
**Authors**: Shawn Achor | **Year**: 2010

## Summary
"The Happiness Advantage" turns the traditional formula for success on its head. Conventional wisdom tells us that if we work hard and achieve success, happiness will follow. Achor proves this formula is broken and presents compelling scientific evidence that happiness actually fuels success and performance, not the other way around. When we become positive, our brains perform significantly better than when they're negative, neutral, or stressed.

Based on Achor's research at Harvard and his work with organizations worldwide, this book reveals seven core principles derived from positive psychology that can help us reprogram our brains for higher performance and greater well-being. The book is perfect for professionals, leaders, students, and anyone looking to improve their effectiveness while increasing their happiness and life satisfaction.

## Core Insights

### Principle #1: The Happiness Advantage
Positive brains have a biological advantage over neutral or negative brains. Research shows that happiness raises nearly every business and educational outcome: raising sales by 37%, productivity by 31%, and accuracy on tasks by 19%, as well as a myriad of health and quality-of-life improvements.

When we're happy, our brains flood with dopamine and serotonin, chemicals that not only make us feel good but also enhance the learning centers of our brains, helping us organize new information, maintain that information longer, and retrieve it faster. This creates a literal advantage that allows us to think more creatively, solve complex problems more effectively, and work more intelligently.

**Quick Take**: Start your day with a positive activity—exercise, meditation, or gratitude practice—to prime your brain for peak performance.

### Principle #2: The Fulcrum and the Lever
Our mindset—the belief we have about our abilities and the meaning we attach to our experiences—acts as a fulcrum that can dramatically change our performance and potential. By shifting our mindset, we can "move our world" and achieve what might seem impossible.

The principle is based on the finding that our expectations create brain patterns that can be just as real as those created by events in the real world. When we believe our behavior matters, we act differently, and those changes in behavior can actually improve our outcomes. Research shows that simply believing stress enhances performance rather than hinders it can improve physiological responses and cognitive functioning.

**Quick Take**: Reframe challenges as opportunities for growth rather than threats to avoid.

### Principle #3: The Tetris Effect
Our brains get stuck in patterns based on what we focus on consistently. Just as people who play Tetris for hours start seeing Tetris patterns everywhere, we can train our brains to scan for positives in our environment, leading to increased happiness and opportunity recognition.

The principle works by reprogramming our reticular activating system (RAS)—the part of our brain that filters what we notice based on what we're looking for. By actively practicing gratitude and positive scanning exercises, we can override our natural tendency to focus on threats, problems, and stressors, instead noticing opportunities, possibilities, and reasons to be grateful.

**Quick Take**: Every day, write down three new things you're grateful for to train your brain to scan for positives.

### Principle #4: Falling Up
We all experience setbacks and failures in life and work, but successful people have a specific way of interpreting and responding to adversity. They've learned to find the "mental path up" from every crisis, using failure as a catalyst for growth and learning.

Research shows that people who can find positive meaning in negative events experience less stress and recover more quickly. This doesn't mean ignoring the pain or difficulty of failure, but rather asking constructive questions like "What lesson can I learn?" or "How can I grow from this experience?" The principle is built on the concept of post-traumatic growth—the phenomenon where some people actually become stronger, wiser, and more successful after experiencing adversity.

**Quick Take**: After every setback, ask yourself what opportunities or lessons might be hidden in the experience.

### Principle #5: The Zorro Circle
When overwhelmed by challenges, we regain control by starting small and gradually expanding our circle of control. Just as Zorro first mastered small circles before taking on larger challenges, we build momentum and confidence by focusing on small, manageable goals.

The principle works by reducing feelings of helplessness and overwhelm through small, achievable wins. Each success builds confidence and competence, gradually expanding what we believe we can accomplish. This approach is particularly effective during times of crisis or major change when it's easy to feel powerless.

**Quick Take**: Identify one small area where you have complete control and start there, gradually expanding your sphere of influence.

### Principle #6: The 20-Second Rule
Willpower is a finite resource, and we can increase good habits and decrease bad habits by making positive choices easier and negative ones harder. The principle suggests adding 20 seconds to the time it takes to do something you want to avoid and removing 20 seconds from activities you want to encourage.

Research shows that our brains are wired to choose the path of least resistance. By understanding this tendency and working with it rather than against it, we can make lasting behavior change much easier. This might mean laying out your gym clothes the night before, removing tempting foods from your home, or creating barriers to time-wasting activities.

**Quick Take**: Reduce friction for good habits (make them easier) and increase friction for bad habits (make them harder).

### Principle #7: Social Investment
The greatest predictor of success and happiness is social support. The more social connections we have, the more resilient, productive, and successful we become, especially during times of stress and challenge.

Research in social neuroscience reveals that our brains are designed to be social, and meaningful relationships provide protection against stress while enhancing our cognitive abilities. The investment in relationships pays dividends in every area of life, from physical health and longevity to career success and personal fulfillment. Even during busy or stressful times, investing in relationships is the most productive use of our time and energy.

**Quick Take**: Prioritize meaningful connections with colleagues, friends, and family, especially during busy or stressful periods.
