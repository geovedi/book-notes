# Still Life: Adventures in Taxidermy
**Authors**: Melissa Milgrom | **Year**: 2010

## Summary
Melissa Milgrom's "Still Life" is a captivating journey into the hidden world of taxidermy, spanning from Victorian curiosity cabinets to modern art galleries. The book begins with Milgrom's chance encounter with animal carcasses in Tanzania, sparking her obsession with understanding why humans preserve dead animals. Her quest leads her to meet a cast of unforgettable characters: the Schwendeman family (three generations of museum taxidermists), competitive taxidermy champions, controversial artists like Damien Hirst, and the collectors bidding on Walter Potter's bizarre Victorian anthropomorphic scenes.

Through these encounters, Milgrom reveals taxidermy as a complex art form that exists at the intersection of science, art, conservation, and our deep-seated desire to hold onto life after death. The book explores both the golden age of museum dioramas and taxidermy's controversial role in contemporary art, showing how this misunderstood craft continues to fascinate and repel us in equal measure.

Perfect for readers interested in obscure professions, the history of museums, Victorian eccentricities, or the boundaries between art and science. You'll gain insight into a craft that most people experience only through horror movies or hunting lodges, discovering instead its surprising sophistication and cultural significance.

## Core Insights

### The Living Museum Taxidermists
The Schwendeman family represents taxidermy at its most refined. David Schwendeman, the last chief taxidermist at the American Museum of Natural History, embodies the dedication of museum taxidermists who view their work as "preserving the beauty of God's creations." Working out of their New Jersey workshop since 1921, the Schwendemans practice what they call "taxidermology" – scientific accuracy combined with artistic skill. Unlike commercial taxidermists who create hunting trophies, they preserve specific individual animals that serve as educational specimens for millions of museum visitors.

> "You have to have the delicate finesse of a watchmaker and the brute strength of a blacksmith. You have to be able to mount a hummingbird and an elephant."

**Quick Take**: Museum taxidermists are essentially anatomists and sculptors who must understand animal behavior, physiology, and habitat to create convincing educational displays that last indefinitely.

### The Competitive World of Modern Taxidermy
At the World Taxidermy Championships, Milgrom discovers a thriving subculture where artists compete for prestige and recognition. These competitions have historically elevated taxidermy from crude stuffing to fine art. Participants like Ray Hatfield spend years perfecting their craft, treating each mount as a unique artistic challenge. The competitive circuit provides community, education, and validation for practitioners who often work in isolation.

**Quick Take**: Taxidermy competitions serve as both artistic validation and technical education, pushing the boundaries of what's possible in preserving animal form and behavior.

### Victorian Eccentricity and Walter Potter
Walter Potter created Victorian England's most beloved museum of curiosities, featuring anthropomorphic scenes like "The Death and Burial of Cock Robin" and "The Guinea Pigs' Cricket Match." His work represents taxidermy's transition from scientific preservation to popular entertainment. The controversial auction and dispersal of his collection in 2003 highlighted the ongoing debate about preserving cultural artifacts versus commercial interests.

> "Taxidermy connotes the taint of bad taste. Why is that?" - asks one character, capturing the persistent class associations with taxidermy.

**Quick Take**: Potter's work shows how taxidermy can transcend simple preservation to become cultural storytelling, though its commercial value often conflicts with its artistic merit.

### Contemporary Art and the Emily Mayer Connection
Damien Hirst's controversial art relies on taxidermists like Emily Mayer to create his provocative installations. Mayer represents the bridge between traditional taxidermy skills and contemporary artistic vision. She brings technical expertise to Hirst's conceptual art, enabling him to create pieces that shock and challenge viewers. Their collaboration highlights taxidermy's evolving role in modern art.

> "I just want to create things that look real. I think art is about life. You want things to reflect that—killing things to look at them."

**Quick Take**: Contemporary art has revived interest in taxidermy by using preserved animals to explore themes of death, mortality, and the relationship between humans and nature.

### The Science Behind Preservation
The book reveals the complex chemistry and anatomical knowledge required for proper taxidermy. From arsenical soap (developed in 1743) to modern preservation techniques, taxidermists have always been part chemist, part artist. The Schwendemans' formula books contain decades of experimental knowledge about preserving everything from hummingbirds to elephants, showing that successful taxidermy requires deep scientific understanding.

**Quick Take**: Taxidermy is fundamentally a scientific discipline that combines chemistry, anatomy, and artistry to suspend the natural process of decay.

## Best Quotes
- "The sight of a particularly fine animal, either alive or dead, excites within me feelings of admiration that often amount to genuine affection; and the study and preservation of such forms has for years been my chief delight."
- "You have to respect and intuition for the animals to bring out their best characteristics."
- "In taxidermy, an animal starts out looking like the animal, gets mangled beyond recognition, and then ends up looking like the animal again."
- "Few objects are as strangely alluring as Flaubert's parrot, Goethe's kingfisher, or Truman Capote's rattlesnake."
- "For me it's a love of life to explore it on the fringes. It's why kids take toys apart. It's a morbid fascination. It shouldn't be."

## Takeaways
- **Visit natural history museums with new eyes**: Notice the craftsmanship in dioramas and understand the years of work behind each specimen
- **Question your assumptions**: Taxidermy isn't just about hunting trophies – it's a sophisticated craft serving science, education, and art
- **Appreciate endangered knowledge**: Traditional taxidermy skills are being lost as digital technology replaces physical specimens
- **Understand cultural context**: Taxidermy reflects society's changing relationship with nature, death, and conservation
- **Recognize artistic value**: The line between scientific specimen and artistic object has always been blurred in taxidermy

## Questions to Consider
- Why are humans so compelled to preserve animal form after death, yet find the practice unsettling?
- How do you feel about zoos and natural history museums displaying preserved animals – is it education or exploitation?
- Should Walter Potter's anthropomorphic scenes be considered art, folk craft, or something else entirely?
- What does our reaction to taxidermy reveal about our relationship with death and the natural world?
- In an age of digital imaging, is there still value in physical preservation of animal specimens?

## Conclusion
"Still Life" is worth your time if you're fascinated by obscure professions, the history of science, or the art world's stranger corners. Milgrom's engaging narrative transforms taxidermy from a creepy curiosity into a sophisticated craft that has shaped our understanding of the natural world. The biggest reason to read this book is to discover the surprising humanity behind taxidermy – these aren't morbid animal killers but dedicated artists and scientists who share our fascination with life's beauty and fragility.

The book succeeds in making you see taxidermy not as death-fixated morbidity but as life-affirming preservation. By the end, you'll understand why people have risked arsenic poisoning, social ostracism, and financial hardship to practice this misunderstood craft. You'll never look at a museum diorama the same way again.
