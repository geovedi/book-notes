# Archaeological Anthropology: Understanding the Relationship Between Disciplines
**Original Title**: Archaeology and Anthropology
**Editors**: Duncan Garrow, Thomas Yarrow | **Year**: 2010

## Summary
This scholarly collection explores the complex, often asymmetrical relationship between archaeology and anthropology, examining how these disciplines have historically intersected, diverged, and influenced one another. The book challenges conventional assumptions about disciplinary boundaries and proposes new ways of thinking about interdisciplinary collaboration in the study of human past and present.

The volume brings together leading scholars from both fields who critically examine the perceived "theoretical trade deficit" between archaeology and anthropology, where archaeologists often draw from anthropological theory while anthropologists rarely engage with archaeological insights. Through historical analysis, theoretical reflection, and case studies, the contributors demonstrate how this perceived asymmetry has been productive for both disciplines while also limiting their potential mutual enrichment.

The book is essential reading for scholars and students interested in interdisciplinary approaches to understanding humanity, material culture, and the complex relationship between past and present. Readers will gain new perspectives on how disciplinary boundaries are constructed, maintained, and potentially transcended.

## Core Insights

### The Historical Asymmetry Between Disciplines
The book traces how archaeology and anthropology, once unified through social evolutionism in the late 19th century, became increasingly separated through institutional differentiation and specialized methodologies. This separation occurred differently in North American and British traditions - in America, archaeology remained part of the four-field approach to anthropology, while in Britain, functionalist anthropology led to greater disciplinary divergence. This historical split created an enduring perception that archaeology suffers from a theoretical "deficit" relative to anthropology.

> "I have sometimes imagined what it might be like to be transported back into the past in a time capsule, to arrive somewhere in Sweden during the Neolithic and to be able to observe what was really going on, stay for a couple of years and then return to the late twentieth century and write up my ethnography. I have thought how much richer, fuller and more sophisticated the account would be." - Tilley (1996)
> _Original: "I have sometimes imagined what it might be like to be transported back into the past in a time capsule, to arrive somewhere in Sweden during the Neolithic and to be able to observe what was really going on..."_

**Quick Take**: The perceived archaeological deficit has actually been productive, forcing archaeologists to be explicit about their methods and open to interdisciplinary insights.

### The Productive Nature of "Not Knowing"
Rather than viewing archaeological limitations purely negatively, several contributors argue that the "partiality" of archaeological evidence has stimulated theoretical innovation and methodological creativity. The need to work with absence and fragmentation has led archaeologists to develop unique approaches to understanding material culture, time, and human agency that anthropologists could benefit from engaging with.

> "The knowledge that they are lost is not, so to speak, lost knowledge, it is knowledge about absence, about forgetting and about an unrecoverable background." - Strathern (1991)
> _Original: "The knowledge that they are lost is not, so to speak, lost knowledge, it is knowledge about absence, about forgetting and about an unrecoverable background."_

**Quick Take**: Archaeological engagement with absence and partiality represents a distinctive form of knowledge, not simply a lack of knowledge.

### Material Culture as Methodological Bridge
The book explores how recent theoretical convergences around material culture, agency, and the body offer new possibilities for meaningful dialogue between disciplines. By rejecting the strict separation between people and things that characterized earlier approaches, contemporary theory provides frameworks for understanding how objects actively participate in social life and meaning-making.

> "Material things can say things which words cannot or do not." - Hodder (1982)
> _Original: "Material things can say things which words cannot or do not."_

**Quick Take**: Material culture studies provide a common ground where archaeologists and anthropologists can contribute complementary insights.

### Time as Theoretical Resource
The collection challenges conventional understandings of time as a barrier between disciplines, arguing instead that archaeology's engagement with deep time and temporal processes offers unique theoretical resources. Rather than seeing temporal separation as creating distance, contributors explore how different temporal scales and perspectives can enrich understanding of social and cultural processes.

> "It might therefore be time to re-examine Leach's position... By viewing the material as a 'residue', essentially exterior to the people who produced it, he assumes that this material does not embody enough of the substance of life for the archaeologist to gain access in that direction either." - McFadyen

**Quick Take**: Archaeology's temporal perspective provides unique insights into long-term processes that complement anthropology's focus on contemporary societies.

### Interdisciplinary Practice Beyond Reduction
The book advocates for forms of interdisciplinary collaboration that respect disciplinary differences rather than attempting to reduce one discipline to the methods of another. This approach emphasizes how disciplinary blind spots and areas of "ignorance" can be mutually illuminating when disciplines are juxtaposed in non-reductive ways.

> "The advantage of the narrow focus of the specialist is that it creates detailed perception of a problem. But it also creates blindspots, eddies of ignorance in epistemological space, which can only be perceived from another perspective." - Macdonald (2007)

**Quick Take**: Effective interdisciplinarity works through illumination rather than appropriation, respecting what each discipline uniquely contributes.

## Best Quotes

- "This volume has been some time in the making. The original impetus to re-visit the relationship between archaeology and anthropology emerged through discussions and debates loosely centred around the archaeological 'theory group', held in the Department of Archaeology, University of Cambridge from around 2002 to 2006."

- "Archaeology is never completely on the inside of the workings of humanity. In this chapter I am going to discuss contexts within time, rather than of the same time, in order to deal directly with the materiality of time and all that that entails."

- "If both positions are as Leach has drawn them then archaeology will never get anywhere, because it can never reach its subject. Leach describes a situation in which the workings of humanity that the archaeologist is interested in are unavailable."

- "The writer of fiction is at liberty to invent - as the historian and the biographer are not. Simon Schama's fiction, mixed with documentary, in 'Dead Certainties' lacks the dramatic power and imaginative grasp of his history."

- "In this situation it is not the job of archaeologists to try make amends for what is 'missing'. Rather I suggest that archaeologists should make the effort to understand humanity in the different way that these limits permit."

## Key Takeaways

- Recognize that perceived disciplinary deficits can be productive and stimulating rather than purely limiting
- Value archaeological engagement with absence, partiality, and fragmentation as distinctive forms of knowledge
- Seek interdisciplinary collaboration that respects differences rather than attempting reduction or assimilation
- Explore material culture as a bridge between disciplines that offers complementary insights
- Consider time and temporal perspective as theoretical resources rather than barriers to understanding
- Question assumptions about disciplinary boundaries and how they are constructed and maintained

## Questions to Consider

- How might anthropological approaches benefit from archaeological perspectives on long-term processes and material culture?
- In what ways does the "partiality" of evidence in different disciplines create unique methodological and theoretical opportunities?
- How can interdisciplinary collaboration avoid reproducing existing asymmetries and power dynamics between disciplines?
- What new forms of knowledge become possible when disciplinary differences are respected rather than reduced?
- How might contemporary theoretical developments around materiality, agency, and time create new possibilities for archaeology-anthropology dialogue?

## Conclusion

This collection represents a significant contribution to understanding the complex relationship between archaeology and anthropology, moving beyond simple calls for increased collaboration to examine the theoretical and practical conditions that make meaningful interdisciplinarity possible. The book is particularly valuable for its nuanced approach to disciplinary asymmetry, recognizing both the productive and limiting aspects of how these disciplines have historically related to one another.

The contributors successfully demonstrate that effective interdisciplinary work requires more than simply borrowing methods or theories from one another - it demands critical reflection on disciplinary assumptions, methodological differences, and the conditions of knowledge production. By taking the perceived "problems" of archaeology seriously as distinctive forms of knowledge rather than simply deficits to be overcome, the volume opens new possibilities for thinking about how archaeology and anthropology might mutually enrich one another.

For scholars and students interested in interdisciplinary approaches to understanding humanity, this book offers both theoretical insights and practical examples of how disciplines might learn from one another without losing what makes each distinctive. Its greatest strength lies in showing how the challenges of interdisciplinary work - including asymmetries, misunderstandings, and methodological differences - can become resources for new forms of knowledge rather than barriers to be overcome.
