# The Easy Way for Women to Stop Smoking
**Authors**: Allen Carr, Francesca Cesati | **Year**: 2010 | **Category**: Health & Medicine

## Summary
"The Easy Way for Women to Stop Smoking" adapts Allen Carr's revolutionary Easyway method specifically for women, dismantling the illusion that smoking provides pleasure or support. The book reveals smoking as a sophisticated trap based on nicotine addiction and societal brainwashing, where smokers don't actually enjoy cigarettes but are trapped in a cycle of relieving withdrawal symptoms they've created themselves. Carr's insight is that smokers continue to smoke not for enjoyment but to scratch an "itch" they've created through addiction.

The method combines counter-brainwashing techniques with understanding nicotine's physiological effects to help women escape without willpower, substitutes, or suffering. Francesca Cesati adds female-specific perspectives addressing weight control concerns, pregnancy pressures, stress management, body image issues, and how women use cigarettes as fashion accessories, confidence boosters, and social crutches.

This revolutionary approach promises immediate freedom by removing the desire to smoke rather than forcing abstinence through willpower. The method's success lies in recognizing that stopping isn't about sacrifice but about gaining freedom, health, wealth, and genuine quality of life improvements.

## Core Insights

### The Smoking Illusion
Smokers don't actually enjoy cigarettes. What appears to be pleasure is simply relief from withdrawal symptoms created by the previous cigarette. This fundamental misunderstanding keeps smokers trapped in the addiction cycle.

> "The only reason any smoker continues to smoke is to scratch that 'itch'—not because they enjoy smoking, or because it relaxes them, or improves meals, or relieves stress."

**Quick Take**: If smoking genuinely relaxed you, relaxation would last longer than a few hours. True relaxation doesn't require constant maintenance.

### Two Monsters of Addiction
- **The "Little Monster"**: Physical nicotine withdrawal is almost imperceptible—an empty, insecure feeling indistinguishable from normal hunger that dies within days of stopping.

- **The "Big Monster"**: The real problem is brainwashing—the belief that cigarettes provide genuine pleasure or support, convincing smokers they need cigarettes to relax, concentrate, handle stress, or enjoy social occasions.

**Quick Take**: Physical withdrawal is minimal; the psychological battle comes from believing you're giving something up.

### Women's Unique Challenges
The tobacco industry specifically targets women with sophisticated marketing linking smoking to style, independence, and attractiveness. Women are also more likely to use cigarettes as emotional support during relationship troubles, hormonal changes, and life transitions.

> "Smoking is nothing more or less than addiction to 'Devastation.'"

**Quick Take**: The "sexy smoking" image is pure marketing fiction designed to trap women in addiction.

### The Revolutionary Method
Instead of fighting addiction with willpower, Easyway removes the desire to smoke entirely through counter-brainwashing. The approach advocates making a clean break immediately once you understand the nature of the trap.

> "My life began when I stopped smoking."

**Quick Take**: You don't need substitutes or gradual reduction—you need the truth about what smoking actually does (and doesn't do) for you.

### No Substitutes, No Suffering
The method explicitly warns against nicotine replacement therapy, gums, patches, or food substitutes, explaining they perpetuate the addiction rather than ending it. When done correctly, there should be no withdrawal suffering.

**Quick Take**: Substitutes keep the "little monster" alive and prevent genuine freedom from addiction.

## Best Quotes
- "The only pleasure any smoker gets from lighting a cigarette is the partial and illusory relief of withdrawal symptoms."
- "You don't become addicted to nicotine because you smoke—you only smoke because you are addicted to nicotine."
- "YIPPEE, I'M A NON-SMOKER!"

- "My life no longer revolves around smoking. I can enjoy life without having to worry, When will I get my next cigarette?"

## Action Items
- **Continue smoking until you finish the entire book** – this prevents premature withdrawal while still brainwashed
- **Question everything you believe about smoking's "benefits"** – examine each perceived benefit honestly
- **Make your last cigarette a conscious ceremony** – recognize there's nothing enjoyable about it
- **Use the YIPPEE mantra** – whenever you think about smoking, celebrate freedom instead of feeling deprived
- **Break all smoking associations** – consciously identify and destroy every situation you associate with smoking
- **Avoid all substitutes** – no nicotine replacement, food substitutes, or other crutches

## Questions to Consider
- When did I last genuinely enjoy a cigarette, not just the relief from craving?
- If smoking genuinely relaxes me, why do I need to smoke so often?
- If cigarettes help with concentration, why can't I think clearly without them?
- If smoking is a pleasure, why do I hide it from people I care about?
- What situations do I associate with smoking, and what beliefs drive these associations?
- If I could go back and never start smoking, would I choose to become a smoker now?

## Conclusion
This isn't just another quit-smoking book—it's a complete re-education that frees women from nicotine addiction without suffering. The method works by removing the desire to smoke rather than forcing abstinence through willpower. For women who have tried and failed multiple times, this approach provides something revolutionary: genuine freedom without the ongoing struggle.

The combination of Carr's proven methodology with Cesati's female-focused insights creates a powerful tool that could finally end the smoking epidemic for women willing to trust the process. The book delivers on its revolutionary promise by making what seems impossible—easy, enjoyable quitting—not only possible but inevitable for those who follow its instructions completely.

**Is it worth your time?** Absolutely. If you're a woman smoker who has tried everything else and failed, this method offers not just hope but certainty of success when applied correctly.
