## True Hackers: Cambridge: The Fifties and Sixties
### The Tech Model Railroad Club

Peter Samson and his friends at MIT had an insatiable curiosity for how things worked and loved exploring and tinkering with machines. During their explorations, they stumbled upon the EAM room in Building 26, which housed large keypunch machines that operated like computers. Their interest in programming and computers led them to take a course taught by John McCarthy, a pioneer in Artificial Intelligence.

As members of the Tech Model Railroad Club (TMRC), Samson's group encountered two factions: one focused on building realistic train layouts, while the other, known as the Signals and Power Subcommittee (S&P), was interested in systems and technology. The S&P group yearned to get hands-on access to computers, especially the IBM 704/709, to learn and experiment.

To gain access to the computers they desired, the hackers engaged in hacking activities, often defying strict rules and regulations. Eventually, Jack Dennis introduced them to the TX-0, a transistor-run computer that captivated them with its interactive capabilities and ease of modification.

The hackers began frequenting the Research Laboratory of Electronics (RLE) to work with the TX-0, as it was more accessible than the IBM 704/709. They soon discovered that the best time to hang out in Building 26 was at night when the TX-0 was available. They adjusted their lifestyles to accommodate the computer, sometimes "vulturing time" and enlisting informers to find openings for usage.

Though Jack Dennis was technically in charge, he preferred to take a hands-off approach, allowing the hackers to explore and innovate freely. Among the group, an outsider named Peter Deutsch, who had a fascination with computers from a young age, became one of them.

To enhance their programming experience, Jack Dennis and Tom Stockman developed a programming system, including an assembler and debugger, making it easier for the hackers to write programs. Their projects ranged from practical applications to creative endeavors, such as making the computer play music.

During peak hours, the hackers were intensely focused on their work, and their logical mind-frames spilled over into other aspects of life. This sometimes amused or annoyed others, as they approached everyday tasks with a hacker's precision and attention to detail.


### The Hacker Ethic

Around the TX-0 computer at MIT, a new way of life was taking shape, infused with a philosophy, ethic, and dream. Central to this culture was the Hacker Ethic, a set of principles that the hackers wholeheartedly embraced. According to this code, access to computers and knowledge should be boundless and unrestricted. They believed that taking things apart and comprehending their inner workings was essential for learning valuable lessons. Information was considered a commodity that should be free, and the act of sharing knowledge was seen as crucial for fostering creativity and progress.

In the hacker's world, authority was met with skepticism, and decentralization was favored to encourage a free flow of information. They wanted to be evaluated based on their skills and contributions, rather than superficial criteria. Moreover, the hackers saw computers as instruments capable of creating art and beauty, and they firmly believed that computers could improve lives, granting individuals power and freedom.

The Hacker Ethic was an unspoken agreement that shaped the behavior of the MIT hacker community. They resisted bureaucratic systems and trusted in the potential of computers to empower individuals. These machines opened up new horizons, allowing the hackers to explore, create, and achieve things that were previously unimaginable.

The belief in the Hacker Ethic spurred the development of innovative programs, including groundbreaking projects like the chess program. For the hackers, the computer held the potential to positively transform society if people approached it with the same curiosity and creativity they demonstrated. The MIT hackers embodied this dream, creating a unique and innovative community driven by their passion for computers and their vision of a better future.



### Spacewar

In the summer of 1961, Alan Kotok and other Tech Model Railroad Club (TMRC) hackers learned about the PDP-1, a revolutionary new machine donated to MIT by Digital Equipment Corporation (DEC). Kotok, a renowned hacker on the TX-0, held immense moral authority among the TMRC hackers. Intrigued by the potential of the PDP-1, they delved into exploring the phone system and MIT's tie lines, meticulously mapping and testing the connections.

The PDP-1 was designed to support the interactive and hands-on hacker style that had thrived within the TX-0 community. Kotok and his fellow hackers wasted no time and began crafting systems software for the PDP-1, including a new assembler known as DDT. Unlike the TX-0, the hackers had even more access to the PDP-1, which prompted them to relocate their operations to the Kluge Room.

The PDP-1 inspired an array of impressive programs, ranging from captivating music compositions to visually stunning display hacks like the Minskytron. Among the standout developments was a visually striking game called Spacewar, envisioned by Steve Russell (Slug). The hackers collectively refined Russell's initial work, aiming for a smooth and reliable gaming experience.

The PDP-1 fostered a strong sense of community among the hackers, who believed that software should be shared as a gift to the world, rather than a product for profit. Spacewar emerged as a computer game made by hackers, offering advantages over the real world as problems could be fixed effortlessly by modifying instructions. Programmers such as Peter Samson and Dan Edwards contributed to enhancing the game, incorporating real constellations and introducing a gravity factor. Shag Garetz introduced a hyperspace capability to the game, adding a thrilling dimension to avoid dire situations.

Numerous variations of Spacewar were created, making it increasingly challenging and enjoyable to play. The game quickly became addictive, leading to marathon tournaments among the hackers on the PDP-1. During the MIT Open House, Spacewar's demonstration attracted considerable attention and sparked significant interest in computer gaming.

As the MIT hackers firmly believed in the positive impact of computing, they set their sights on making computers more accessible to people. Their aspirations culminated in the conception of time-sharing systems, eventually leading to the establishment of Project MAC (Multiple Access Computing/Machine Aided Cognition). This ambitious project aimed to create an ideal facility where hackers could work on their groundbreaking ideas and realize their dreams within the realm of computing. Richard Greenblatt was among the brilliant hackers who played a vital role in shaping Project MAC.


### Greenblatt and Gosper

Ricky Greenblatt was a renowned hacker known for his exceptional focus and prolific hacking skills. From a young age, he displayed a natural inclination towards electronics and further honed his abilities with the guidance of mentors. After attending MIT, Greenblatt became deeply immersed in hacking, particularly with the PDP-1 computer.

His accomplishments were remarkable, including writing the first FORTRAN compiler for the PDP-1, which made him indispensable to the hacking community. Another brilliant hacker, Bill Gosper, focused more on mathematical exploration and algorithms. The hacking community, centered around the TMRC and the PDP-1, engaged in passionate debates and discussions about coding and computer systems.

The hackers' enthusiasm extended beyond computing, enjoying Chinese food outings where they explored the restaurant's menu system and playfully challenged the staff's assumptions. They were intensely passionate about computers and hacking, with their gatherings revolving around various hacking issues. Critical of IBM's dominance in the computer industry, they often discussed flaws in computer systems.

The hackers were predominantly male and prioritized hacking over romantic relationships, embracing what they called "bachelor mode." The presence of women in the hacking community was scarce, and there were no star-quality female hackers at the time. Some hackers had unorthodox personal habits, but their focus remained on hacking and creating the best computer systems.

They highly valued the power of LISP as a programming language and recognized its potential for artificial intelligence. Greenblatt, a key figure in the group, developed a highly successful chess program called MacHack. The hackers exhibited an intense passion for their work and a deep understanding of computers, setting them apart from critics who didn't fully comprehend the world of hacking.


### The Midnight Computer Wiring Society

Greenblatt and Gosper were visionary hackers at MIT who played a pivotal role in laying the foundation for the Hacker Ethic. In 1963, Stewart Nelson became the third leg of the techno-cultural triangle at MIT. He quickly displayed curiosity and exceptional skills in electronics, earning the status of a master hacker. Nelson gained fame for his exploits in the phone system, manipulating tones to make free long-distance calls.

His fascination with electronics began early in life, and he possessed a natural talent for it. Joining the Tech Model Railroad Club (TMRC), Nelson started exploring phone hacking around the campus alongside other hackers. Engaging in "phone phreaking," they sought to understand the phone system without seeking personal gain. The hackers went on to develop blue boxes, allowing them to explore toll-free area-code-800 numbers.

Nelson excelled in programming, impressing even the most skilled programmers like Ed Fredkin. Despite his shy and socially introverted nature, he was deeply dedicated to hacking and the principles of the Hacker Ethic. A notable aspect of his expertise was lock hacking, seen as a playful challenge against artificial barriers.

The TMRC hackers firmly believed in open access to information and tools, viewing them as essential for the pursuit of knowledge and improvement. They were skilled at lock hacking and had access to master keys and grandmaster keys. This required persistence, patience, and the dismantling of locks to find common key combinations. Even for high-security master keys requiring special "blanks," the hackers found ways to acquire them.

The master key symbolized the hacker's love for free access and the ability to overcome bureaucratic control. The administrator, Russ Noftsker, struggled to maintain control over the hackers and eventually adopted a policy of "unilateral disarmament." This allowed the hackers certain freedoms in exchange for not openly challenging the administration.

However, conflicts arose with Bill Bennett, a machine shop craftsman who was not a hacker. Bennett's strict philosophy about tool usage and privacy clashed with the hacker's view of sharing and collaborative work. A confrontation between Nelson and Bennett over a damaged screwdriver further escalated tensions between the hackers and Bennett.

### Winners and Losers

The AI lab at Tech Square was a close-knit community that ardently followed the Hacker Ethic, driven by their passion for technology and hacking. Among them was David Silver, a dyslexic 14-year-old with a fascination for computers and robotics, who spent considerable time at the AI lab.

At the lab, robotics was a significant area of interest, and the hackers were exhilarated by the idea of building machines capable of independent movement, sight, and cognition. They saw themselves as "winners," proud of their hacking abilities, while those without expertise were labeled as "losers." The AI theorists and graduate students on the eighth floor were considered nemeses by the hackers due to their lack of hands-on hacking skills.

For the hackers, computer programming was akin to artistic expression, enabling them to understand and control the world around them. They strongly favored interactive programming and had disdain for batch processing or bureaucratic systems like CTSS (Compatible Time-Sharing System). On occasion, they even found ways to circumvent password requirements on systems like CTSS to express their contempt.

Multics, a time-sharing system developed in collaboration with General Electric and later taken over by Honeywell, was highly disliked by hackers, even more than CTSS. Its slow teletype Model 33 terminals and the IBM-created PL/I language were sources of annoyance. Moreover, Multics imposed heavy security and charged users for memory, disk space, and time, directly clashing with the Hacker Ethic. In response, hackers played tricks and caused system crashes as a form of rebellion.

Although planners at the AI lab aimed to convert the PDP-6 into a time-sharing machine, hackers initially resisted the idea. It was Ed Fredkin, a friend of the hackers, who eventually persuaded Ricky Greenblatt, a prominent hacker, to accept time-sharing on the PDP-6. A compromise was struck, allowing time-sharing late at night while preserving single-user control during the day.

To maintain their vision of an open and collaborative system, the hackers created their own time-sharing system known as the Incompatible Time-sharing System (ITS). ITS was designed to be more compatible with other systems and enabled users to run multiple programs simultaneously. Trusting the users not to abuse the system, ITS had minimal security. The hackers continuously improved the system, and no program was ever considered complete.

ITS epitomized the Hacker Ethic, but its adoption as a national standard failed during a meeting at the University of Utah. Nonetheless, the hackers were more focused on creating their own society at Tech Square, diligently applying the principles of the Hacker Ethic to build perfect systems.


### Life

During the era on the ninth floor of Tech Square, hackers experienced a Golden Age of hacking, dedicating themselves wholeheartedly to programming and creating what seemed like a paradise-like existence. They embraced the Hacker Ethic, seamlessly blending art, science, and play, and mastering the flow of information within computers.

However, their idealistic lifestyle faced opposition from the public, who perceived computers as tools of oppression and dehumanization. The AI lab's funding from the Department of Defense also led to tensions and protests, with critics denouncing the perceived connection to military applications. A protest march at Tech Square brought the hacker community face to face with the antiwar movement's criticisms of their work.

The hackers, known for their aloofness, avoided introspection into their emotional lives, focusing solely on hacking and computer-related pursuits. While some hackers faced mental health challenges, the community remained supportive and accepting of one another.

The influence of the Hacker Ethic extended beyond MIT, spreading to other institutions and businesses. Many hackers moved to Stanford's AI Lab, where they found a more laid-back and less confrontational atmosphere compared to MIT. At Stanford, hackers developed the text-based adventure game "Adventure," which became highly influential in the gaming world. Adventure, as a metaphor for computer programming, was continuously improved and addictive.

In the context of this changing landscape, Bill Gosper, a prominent hacker, developed an obsession with the game of LIFE, a computer simulation known for its complexity. Gosper searched for a glider gun, a particular pattern within LIFE, and speculated about the existence of intelligent entities within the simulation.

Despite the enthusiasm and innovation, Gosper came to realize the limitations of the hacker dream at MIT. The AI lab at MIT underwent changes in the 1970s, marking the end of a significant era for the hacker community.

However, a second wave of hackers emerged, focusing on small and powerful computers, spreading the hacker dream to new horizons. The spirit of hacking and the Hacker Ethic continued to evolve and thrive, leaving a lasting impact on the world of technology and beyond.


## Hardware Hackers: Northern California: The Seventies
### Revolt in 2100

The Community Memory project was an innovative communication system that aimed to connect people based on mutual interests using computer terminals. Its first public terminal was located in Berkeley, California, resembling a unique, squashed piano-like machine with a typewriter keyboard. The Berkeley community quickly embraced the terminal, using it for various purposes, from finding information about events to seeking like-minded individuals.

At the forefront of this revolution was Doctor Benway, a key figure who took the hacker dream to new levels. Another prominent figure was Lee Felsenstein, one of the founders of Community Memory, who was passionate about promoting the hacker dream and bringing computers to the people. Lee had been fascinated with electronics from a young age, and science-fiction novels by authors like Robert Heinlein influenced his interest in technology.

Lee was actively involved in political activism and computer programming, having participated in the Free Speech Movement. He worked as a caretaker at Resource One, a collective with a time-sharing computer in San Francisco. It was there that he met Efrem Lipkin, a new roommate, who introduced the idea of taking the computer project to the streets.

The vision for Community Memory was to utilize technology as a tool of social change and spread the Hacker Ethic to a wider audience. It became an offshoot of Resource One, with computers placed on the streets to connect people and foster a sense of community. Lee Felsenstein successfully convinced Resource One to fund an office/apartment in Berkeley for Community Memory.

The People's Computer Company (PCC), a counterculture group, also played a significant role in combining computers and politics. Led by visionary Bob Albrecht, PCC started teaching computer classes to high school students, aiming to spread the Hacker Ethic and promote computer education. Albrecht's book "Computer Lib" became a cult classic during the computer revolution.

Community Memory's parent company, Loving Grace Cybernetics, was established to support the project. They experimented with a Model 33 teletype terminal at Leopold's Records in Berkeley, which received a positive reception from the public, offering connections and information.

Users of the terminal ventured into uncharted applications, creating personas like "Doctor Benway," and Jude Milhon made poetic contributions with her online personalities. Despite its successes, Community Memory faced challenges, leading to a decision to temporarily suspend the project due to technical and financial constraints. Nonetheless, the project left a significant impact, paving the way for future developments in computer-mediated communication and community building.



### Every Man a God

In June 1974, Lee Felsenstein moved into a one-room apartment in Berkeley and embarked on a design project for a computer terminal inspired by the Community Memory concept. His vision was to create transparent and accessible terminals that encouraged user interaction and flexibility in computer technology. Drawing inspiration from Ivan Illich's ideas in "Tools for Conviviality," Felsenstein aimed to build a tool that embodied Illich's vision of a symbiotic relationship between the user and the tool.

Felsenstein's creation, the "Tom Swift Terminal," was envisioned as a terminal for the people, bringing the hacker dream to life and spreading the Hacker Ethic throughout society. While seeking work at Systems Concepts, Felsenstein remained skeptical of the MIT hackers' approach to technology, particularly their lack of concern for disseminating it among the general population.

During this time, Felsenstein met Bob Marsh, a hardware hacker interested in building a "TV Typewriter" project, and they decided to collaborate on the Tom Swift Terminal. Despite the growing Silicon Valley, Felsenstein was cautious about using brand-new microprocessor technology, instead preferring established components for his terminal.

At that time, the idea of having a computer in the home was still considered absurd, but the Bay Area's hardware hackers were enthusiastic about exploring electronics and building various projects. However, in January 1975, Ed Roberts of MITS introduced the Altair 8800 computer kit through Popular Electronics, which generated a massive response from hobbyists and hackers across the country. The Altair's success demonstrated the power of computers in the hands of individuals and ignited curiosity and creativity within the hardware hacking community.

Around the same time, a museum and educational center received a grant to support literacy in the sciences, with a computer education program run by Bob Kahn. The early 1970s computer education program featured a large HP time-sharing computer with teletype terminals, captivating individuals like Steve Dompier. He was fascinated by the computer's speed and became addicted to it, spending time playing games, programming in BASIC, and accessing Lawrence Hall's computer by phone.

Dompier's excitement about the Altair 8800 grew after reading about it, and he eventually visited the MITS headquarters. Despite the challenges of assembling the Altair kit, completing it brought a sense of accomplishment. The Altair's significance lay in being an affordable computer that enticed people to build their own computers, sparking further interest in the hardware hacking community.

Fred Moore, another enthusiast, shared Felsenstein's belief in computers' potential to bring people together. He made efforts to start a hardware group called the "Amateur Computer Users Group Homebrew Computer Club," further fueling the spirit of innovation and collaboration in the emerging computer revolution.


### The Homebrew Computer Club

The first meeting of the Homebrew Computer Club took place on a rainy night in Silicon Valley. The participants were passionate about hardware and had a keen interest in building and studying computers at home. The club's main focus was on cooperation and the sharing of knowledge among like-minded enthusiasts.

The Altair 8800, a microcomputer, served as a significant inspiration for the group. During meetings, members engaged in discussions on various topics, such as hex vs. octal numbers, operating codes for the 8080 chip, and different storage methods. At one meeting, Steve Dompier demonstrated the first working Altair application by playing a song on the computer, showcasing the machine's potential.

As time went on, the Homebrew Computer Club evolved into a haven for hackers and started attracting more hardware designers and enthusiasts. Notably, Bob Marsh, Lee Felsenstein, and others began designing and building circuit boards to plug into the Altair bus.

The club's growth was exponential, creating a close-knit community centered around hardware hacking and exploration. Although Gordon French, one of the founders, had a more didactic style that didn't fully align with the hacker spirit of the club, the majority of members preferred a more technical and hardware-focused approach to their activities.

Fred Moore, the initial moderator, believed in the club's potential for social change through technology sharing and public service work. However, most members were more interested in technical aspects than pushing a social change agenda.

With Lee Felsenstein taking on the role of the new moderator, the club managed to bring together the hacker spirit and a sense of political computerism. The club's structure facilitated free-flowing information exchange and collaboration among members.

The Homebrew Computer Club's members were driven by their passion for hacking, exploring, and building hardware and software. The club's synergy and support empowered individuals to develop new products and ideas, leading to the creation of new companies in the emerging computer industry.

Notably, Les Solomon, an influential figure in the computer world, visited the club and shared stories about vril, a mythical power. The collective energy and dedication to the hacker ethic among the Homebrew Computer Club members empowered them to contribute significantly to the transformation of the computer industry and society's perception of computers.



### Tiny BASIC

In the 1970s, hardware hackers had a strong desire to build and expand the capabilities of the Altair computer. The Homebrew Computer Club served as a focal point for these enthusiasts, but conflicts arose over the free flow of information, a central tenet of the Hacker Ethic.

Paul Allen and Bill Gates developed Altair BASIC, a highly sought-after language for the Altair computer, with plans to sell it. However, some hackers at the Homebrew Club became impatient while waiting for Altair BASIC and decided to copy and share it freely.

Bill Gates expressed his frustration with software piracy and its impact on their business through an "Open Letter to Hobbyists." The hacker community had varying responses to the issue of commercialization, with some supporting the sharing of free software, while others, like Tom Pittman, chose to sell software at low prices to test whether people would buy it instead of pirating.

Pittman's success in selling Tiny BASIC for $5 demonstrated a different approach. However, he faced personal challenges, including a divorce resulting from his devotion to computers. In an essay called "Deus Ex Machina, or The True Computerist," Pittman explained the hacker's satisfaction after successfully hacking something. He outlined his "creed of the computerist," which included the belief that the computer was more interesting than most people and the importance of attending club meetings for news, how-to-fixits, and free software.

Despite the allure of constant computer use, Pittman changed his habits due to the negative impact it had on his personal life. He started taking a day of rest and working hard on the other six days to find a balance.

Lee Felsenstein envisioned the Homebrew Computer Club as an anarchist community that reflected the style of hackerism. He contrasted it with the bureaucratic approach of the Southern California Computer Society (SCCS), which eventually faded away. Felsenstein aimed to create an environment conducive to the "Hands-On Imperative," allowing users to learn about and control the tools they used, rather than being kept away from them.

To further this vision, Felsenstein designed the "Tom Swift Terminal" for Processor Technology, a video display module (VDM) that facilitated memory sharing between display and computational tasks. Additionally, he collaborated with Bob Marsh to design the Sol, a complete computer and intelligent terminal that broke into the mainstream market and brought hacking into homes.

The Sol garnered significant attention at PC '76 in Atlantic City and received wider exposure when it appeared on Tom Snyder's "Tomorrow" show, showcasing the power and potential of computers to a broader audience.


### Woz

Steve Wozniak was an active participant in the Homebrew Computer Club meetings, where his early interest and talent in computer hacking were evident. He designed his own TV Typewriter and computer, being fascinated by microprocessors and instruction sets. During this time, he also met John Draper (Captain Crunch) and engaged in phone phreaking activities.

Wozniak's passion for computer design led to the development of the Apple I and Apple II computers. The Homebrew Computer Club served as a catalyst for innovation and collaboration, where Wozniak's clever design choices and optimizations in the Apple II were appreciated and admired. His special BASIC commands and sketches of the machine's innards inspired others, like Chris Espinosa, to write BASIC programs and create flashy color displays.

As Wozniak and Steve Jobs worked on creating the Apple II, Jobs focused on building up Apple and hiring top-notch management talent like Mike Markkula and Mike Scott. Engineers like Ed Roberts learned the importance of strong management for a successful company. While Wozniak's commitment to the computer was more about design and hacking, Jobs convinced him to join Apple full-time and dedicate himself to the company.

The shift was happening in the computer industry, transitioning from hobbyist hacking to a business-oriented focus. This shift became evident at the First Annual West Coast Computer Faire, where thousands of attendees witnessed the success of Apple and other companies. The Faire marked the triumph of hardware hackers, as their passion for computers turned into a burgeoning industry.

It became apparent at the Faire that small computers were about to revolutionize society, creating a massive consumer market for computers. Wozniak's vision and dedication, combined with Jobs' business acumen, played a pivotal role in shaping the future of personal computing.


### Secrets

Ted Nelson's speech was an unplanned outburst that signified the unprecedented growth in the microcomputer industry. Homebrew hackers found themselves at a crossroads - some ventured into business, forming new companies, while others continued their hacking endeavors. The advent of small computers spread the hacker spirit, but many overlooked the role of money in the proliferation of computer power.

The West Coast Computer Faire played a pivotal role in transitioning hackers from working in garages to entering mainstream consumer markets. Companies like Commodore PET and Radio Shack TRS-80 introduced ready-to-use computers, becoming megamillion-dollar enterprises.

As the pioneers of Homebrew faced increasing competition, changes occurred in their hacker ethic, leading to a degree of secrecy within their companies. For instance, John Draper, a former hacker, was hired by Apple but encountered challenges due to his unconventional programming style.

Apple, though still possessing a sense of community, began focusing more on creating products and maintaining market share. Meanwhile, Lee Felsenstein remained dedicated to the revival of Community Memory, despite the success of personal computers.

Processor Technology, a company involved with Homebrew, eventually crumbled due to lack of planning and competition. On the other hand, Lee Felsenstein found financial success by designing the Osborne 1 for Adam Osborne, but faced internal conflicts at Community Memory.

Despite computers gaining widespread acceptance, the original vision of Community Memory seemed to have faltered. Efrem Lipkin's departure further compounded the group's challenges, eventually leading to the demise of Osborne Computer.

Amidst these changes, Lee Felsenstein's dedication remained steadfast, focused on promoting accessible hardware construction and the magic of computers for the next generation of hackers.


## Game Hackers: The Sierras: The Eighties
### The Wizard and the Princess

Driving northeast out of Fresno on Route 41, one encounters Oakhurst, a small town featuring a modern poly-mart named Raley's and a few fast-food joints. However, amidst this quaint setting, a significant development was taking place. Sierra On-Line, a company built on the hacker dream and specializing in adventure games, had its roots in this region.

Ken Williams, the founder of Sierra On-Line, was once a hacker himself, but he transitioned into a successful businessman. The company experienced remarkable growth, going from two founders to around seventy employees in a single year. Driven by ambition, Ken Williams aspired to take Sierra On-Line public, capitalizing on the rising popularity of the computer games industry and the broader computer industry.

Ken's journey in the world of computers had its ups and downs. He initially struggled with them but later became fascinated with programming. A critical figure in his journey was Jay Sullivan, a programming wizard with whom Ken found great synergy. Despite his growing responsibilities as a businessman, Ken's passion for programming remained strong, and he disliked traditional managerial structures.

The impetus to establish Sierra On-Line came from Ken's desire for financial security and a better lifestyle. Buying an Apple II computer was a turning point, as its interactive capabilities and power captivated him. Initially planning to write a FORTRAN compiler for the Apple, Ken became intrigued by the idea of creating adventure games with graphics.

The involvement of Ken's wife, Roberta Williams, further fueled the company's journey. She became fascinated with playing "Adventure" on the computer and expressed interest in making her own adventure game. Together, they formed On-Line Systems and brought to life their first game, "Mystery House," featuring graphics and puzzles. The game's independent success brought significant profits, propelling them forward.

As the company continued to flourish, Sierra On-Line moved to the mountains, establishing its headquarters there. Their second game, "Wizard and the Princess," sold over sixty thousand copies, further solidifying their position in the industry. With the rapid growth of On-Line Systems, they expanded their team and operations, setting the stage for Sierra On-Line's future accomplishments.


### The Brotherhood

The Hacker Ethic, fueled by the popularity of small, affordable computers from companies like Apple, Radio Shack, Commodore, and Atari, was undergoing a transformation and spreading across the country. As these computers proliferated, there was a growing demand for innovative programs, leading to the rise of software companies such as On-Line, Sirius, and Brøderbund.

Early computer owners found themselves immersed in the hacker mentality, as even the simplest tasks on these machines required a learning process and seeking help from experts. Computer stores emerged as the primary distribution channels for software, with games being the most popular programs that harnessed the machines' power.

Notably, pioneers like Nasir Gebelli began writing games with impressive graphics and effects specifically for the Apple computer. Margot Tommervik founded Softalk magazine, which became closely associated with the Apple World software companies and provided a valuable platform for advertising and information sharing.

In a remarkable display of camaraderie and cooperation, companies like On-Line, Sirius, and Brøderbund formed a Brotherhood within the Apple World industry. They worked together, exchanging information and collaborating to benefit users and improve software quality. Instead of sabotaging each other, competitors embraced a spirit of cooperation and mutual support in their quest to push the boundaries of computer technology and software development.


### The Third Generation

The chapter explores the life of John Harris, a born hacker with a natural curiosity and inclination towards technical matters, especially computers and games. From a young age, John was fascinated by computers, prompting him to explore various machines and programming languages. His particular interest in the Atari 800 and its game development capabilities led him to create a Pac-Man-style game, which he had to modify to avoid copyright issues with Atari.

John eventually joined On-Line Systems, where he and the team worked on a preventive dentistry-themed game called Jawbreaker. However, dissatisfaction grew among developers at Atari due to its bureaucratic nature and lack of recognition for programmers. This led some top programmers to leave Atari and form their own companies, causing a decline in Atari's market share. Instead of addressing the issue of disappearing programmers, Atari focused on licensing and litigation.

During the summer of 1981, a brilliant hacked version of Pac-Man, created by John Harris, began circulating in users' groups. Atari took notice and expressed interest in buying the game from John. However, due to past conflicts, John refused to have his name associated with anything published by Atari. Instead, he completed Jawbreaker for On-Line Systems, and the game became a bestseller.

Atari believed that Jawbreaker infringed on their right to profit from Pac-Man and pressured On-Line Systems. Atari's lawyers attempted to resolve the issue through negotiation, offering a low royalty. However, Ken Williams, the owner of On-Line Systems, chose to stand firm and fight Atari in court. The situation became tense, with the possibility of Atari shutting down On-Line Systems.

During the legal proceedings, John Harris was deposed and struggled with the adversarial nature of the legal system. Atari's lawyers tried to prove that Jawbreaker copied Pac-Man, but the judge refused to grant a preliminary injunction. Despite the ruling, Ken Williams was not entirely content and preferred to settle the lawsuit before it went to trial.


### Summer Camp

Ken Williams, the founder of On-Line Systems, cultivated a creative subculture of hacker-programmers, influenced by games like Galaxian, Dungeons and Dragons, and Star Wars. He had a unique approach to hiring young programmers, offering them free rent and impromptu graphics tutorials. The office at On-Line was chaotic but highly productive, reflecting the company's unstructured and fun atmosphere. Ken's focus was on having fun, getting rich, and being part of a politically and morally positive field.

One of On-Line's most ambitious projects, Time Zone, faced organizational challenges but eventually achieved a successful release. Another game, Softporn, an adult-themed adventure game, caused controversy but became a big seller for On-Line. Ken firmly believed that personal computers could transform people's lives and used On-Line to help underutilized individuals in the community.

Warren Schwader, a talented programmer, joined On-Line and produced successful games like Cribbage and Threshold. However, Warren struggled with the conflict between his love for programming and his devotion to his faith as a Jehovah's Witness.

Meanwhile, John Harris, a Third-Generation hacker, lived in the Sierra foothills away from San Diego. Despite his hacker superstar status and six-figure income from his royalty deal with On-Line for his games, John was unhappy due to the lack of a girlfriend. Ken and Roberta Williams, the founders of On-Line Systems, made it their unofficial goal to help John find a girlfriend.

However, John faced difficulties finding women in Oakhurst; most women were in high school or not his type. Ken's various attempts to help him find a girlfriend often ended in disaster or embarrassment. Despite the dating troubles, Ken remained dedicated to On-Line and sought to attract talented programmers with marketing materials focusing on money and financial success.

As the computer industry boomed and companies like Apple experienced rapid growth and investment offers, Ken chose to stay dedicated to On-Line Systems. He continued to enjoy his successful and fulfilling life as a hacker entrepreneur.


### Frogger

Ken Williams' company, On-Line Systems, was experiencing rapid growth, but Ken became frustrated with his star programmer, John Harris, and young hackers in general. With the company's expansion, Ken no longer had time to provide technical assistance. The home computer software industry was changing, and the focus was shifting towards marketing rather than hacker creativity.

To capitalize on the popularity of arcade games, Ken acquired the rights to Frogger and assigned John Harris to convert it to the Atari Home Computer. However, John's version of Frogger, along with his entire software collection, was stolen, leaving him in a deep depression. Despite setbacks, John rewrote Frogger, and it became a successful game for On-Line Systems.

As On-Line Systems continued to grow, Ken Williams started making deals with companies like Sega, Jim Henson, and IBM for game development and partnerships. The company received venture capital to support its expansion. To provide cohesive leadership and professional management, Ken brought in Dick Sunderland, his former boss, as the new president of On-Line Systems. The company underwent a name change to Sierra On-Line, with a new logo introduced on September 1, 1982.

Ken Williams wanted to reduce programmer royalties from 30% to 20% to limit their power and focus on marketing and promotion, which led to a clash of cultures between hackers and bureaucracy. The programmers resisted the rigid corporate structure imposed by Dick Sunderland and missed the old hacker culture. Third-Generation hackers at Sierra On-Line were unhappy with the changes.

The company faced competition from other software companies like Brøderbund and Sirius, which offered higher royalties. Some programmers considered leaving for other companies like Electronic Arts. In response, Ken Williams hired new programmers with little experience and aimed to mold them into software superstars.

Amidst these changes, Bob and Carolyn Box, middle-aged gold prospectors, became programmers at On-Line and developed educational games. Roberta Williams, proud of the company's success, wanted to promote the message of On-Line's accomplishments to the world. The media took an interest in the company, and an NBC Magazine crew visited the offices to film a documentary.


### Applefest

The Third Generation hackers faced compromises to the Hacker Ethic as commercial interests and money started influencing the software industry. The introduction of copy protection by software publishers created conflicts with hackers who believed in the free sharing of information. Hackers saw copy protection as limiting their ability to modify and improve programs, which they viewed as organic entities. This led to a battle between hackers and publishers, with hackers finding ways to break the protection schemes.

Mark Duchaineau, a Third-Generation hacker, developed Spiradisk, a copy protection scheme, and wanted to use it for On-Line Systems' programs. However, the reluctance to adopt traditional copy protection created conflicts within On-Line Systems, causing tensions in the company. Ultima 2, a highly anticipated game by Richard Garriott (Lord British), faced delays due to Spiradisk copy protection concerns.

The 1982 San Francisco Applefest was a significant gathering of Apple World companies but marked the end of its importance as the industry shifted its focus to larger trade-only shows. The show reflected the economic explosion in the computer industry, with many attendees being millionaires who were once involved in obscure and unprofitable activities. Start-ups were drawn to the success of the Apple World, seeking to establish newer software companies.

Electronic Arts (EA) was one such company aiming to revolutionize the software industry and attract independent software artists. Founded by Trip Hawkins, who had left Apple to pursue this venture, EA hosted a party at the Applefest, attracting programmers and industry authors. Steve Wozniak, an Apple co-founder, was involved in industry gatherings and served as a board member of EA.

As the industry grew, the relationships among companies became more competitive, leading to tensions. Softalk magazine published a negative review of On-Line's game, Frogger, which led to friction between On-Line and Softalk. The Williamses experienced the changing dynamics of the Brotherhood, as companies grew larger and more competitive.

Despite the challenges, On-Line hosted a dinner with Wozniak as the guest of honor. However, a fire broke out at Ken and Roberta Williams' home, causing significant damage and destroying Ken's original Apple I motherboard, a sentimental artifact for him.


### Wizard vs. Wizards

In December of 1982, Tom Tatum organized a television contest called "Wizard vs. Wizards," where game designers played each other's games for prizes. The contest featured hackers from different companies, representing a new kind of hero who fought with brains instead of muscle. The event aimed to draw a new audience to the genre of "docusports" programming, focusing on the growing popularity of computer games. However, the hackers participating in the contest seemed uncomfortable and ill at ease with the publicity and attention.

Amidst the contest, Bob Davis, a former alcoholic turned software superstar, faced personal struggles, drug addiction, and legal troubles. Sierra On-Line, the company organizing the contest, experienced internal conflicts between Ken Williams and Dick Sunderland. The company struggled with managing growth, maintaining the hacker spirit, and prioritizing quality over business demands.

John Harris, an influential hacker at Sierra On-Line, became disillusioned with the company and decided to leave for another company, Synapse Software. Ken Williams believed that the age of independent hacker auteurs was over, and he valued timely delivery and business efficiency over perfection. To achieve this, he recruited professionals with backgrounds in corporate programming and government contracts, seeking to replace hackers with goal-oriented programmers.

On-Line's strategy shifted from creating new worlds to maximizing sales by duplicating successful games and converting existing ones to other platforms. Ken Williams was introduced to a new venture called "Rich and Rich Synergistic Enterprises," which offered professional programmers for game conversion. These programmers would develop proprietary tools and techniques for conversion, and their source code would remain hidden.

Sierra On-Line faced various challenges due to competition, economic slumps, and the cost of ROM cartridges. Ken had to seek venture capital and dealt with disputes with some programmers, including John Harris, over royalty disagreements. Despite the challenges, Ken and Roberta Williams celebrated their new house and the success they achieved through the computer game industry. The company's future remained uncertain, and it grappled with the impact of the evolving software industry.


## The Last of the True Hackers: Cambridge: 1983
### The Last of the True Hackers

Richard Stallman, a true hacker, found his place at MIT's AI lab, where he fully embraced the Hacker Ethic. His view of the Hacker Ethic solidified in this environment, valuing openness, cooperation, and the removal of artificial obstacles. Stallman went on to develop the EMACS editing program, which he distributed for free, encouraging collaboration among users.

However, changes in the lab's security policies, passwords, and the increasing commercialization of software began to erode the Hacker Ethic. The development of the LISP machine by Greenblatt and others led to the formation of two rival companies, Symbolics and LMI, causing division among hackers. Stallman, in response, collaborated with LMI to counter Symbolics' proprietary approach, engaging in "reverse engineering" to give LMI access to their improvements and harm Symbolics.

Feeling like the last true hacker left on earth, Stallman lamented the loss of the anarchistic and innovative environment that was once possible at the AI lab. He left MIT with a plan to write GNU, a version of UNIX, and give it away for free, preserving his principles and the Hacker Ethic.

At MIT, the emergence of hackerism aimed to explore the magic of computers, and it played a significant role in the growth of the personal computer industry. As more people used computers and experienced their possibilities, the Hacker Ethic spread throughout the culture. However, conflicts with the values of the outside world might have lessened the purity of the Hacker Ethic.

Despite these challenges, the Hacker Ethic continued to thrive through generations. Bill Gosper, a hacker, encountered a young kid who identified as a hacker, showing the continuation of hackerism. Lee Felsenstein, a pioneer, celebrated the success of bringing computers to the people and recognized the impact of computers on society. He emphasized the importance of finding a symbiotic relationship between humans and machines for the future.

The Third Generation of hackers emerged as superstar game designers and culture heroes, further spreading the Hacker Ethic. The portrayal of technology and myth in movies like WarGames highlighted the triumph of the individual over collective dis-spirit and the questioning of conventional wisdom. Felsenstein emphasized that defying cultural norms with creative powers was the essence of the Hacker Ethic.


### Afterword: Ten Years After

Hackers are often described as dedicated, innovative, and irreverent computer programmers who challenge the status quo. Despite facing disinterest from corporate America, they succeeded in liberating technology and pushing for the adoption of their unique style. However, the hacker community also faced negative stereotypes, especially after some high-profile arrests of teenagers for digital trespassing.

Over time, the tide turned, and hacker ideals began to gain positive recognition. The media and Silicon Valley embraced the hacker culture, and the term "hacker" became widely known, representing influential and cool individuals. Hacker ideas and ideals even spread beyond the computer industry and into the broader culture, leaving a lasting impact on society.

As an update on some principal characters from the book, they continue to be involved in technology and hacking. They maintain their dedication to innovation and continue to view hacking as a means of exploring the magic of computers. These true hackers are still influential figures, inspiring others to embrace the hacker spirit and creative powers to defy cultural norms.


### Afterword: 2010

Bill Gates reflects on the evolution of the tech industry, tracing his journey from a young programmer to an industry veteran. The book "Hackers" captures the essence of the computer revolution, showcasing the scarily obsessive, brainy, and inventive people who were behind it. At its core, the hacker ethic emphasizes playfulness, a disregard for limitations, and a belief in the free flow of information.

Initially facing criticism, the book eventually found a receptive audience, inspiring many in their careers and thinking. The tension between hacker idealism and commercial interests remains a central controversy in the information age.

In the interview, several figures from the book are revisited, including Bill Gates, Steve Wozniak, Richard Greenblatt, Richard Stallman, Lee Felsenstein, and Paul Graham. Gates talks about his transition from an intense young hacker to a successful entrepreneur and family man. Wozniak remains a hacker legend while embracing his pop-culture status. Stallman continues his crusade for free software and still feels like an outsider in the modern world. Felsenstein views hacking as an ideal and supports a new generation of hackers through Hacker Dojo. Paul Graham equates hacking with entrepreneurial effectiveness and values hackers in his startup incubator.

Mark Zuckerberg, the CEO of Facebook, recognizes the importance of hackers in building and growing successful companies. The individual mentioned in the text is interested in building societies and studying how systems work. Rather than hacking individual systems, he focuses on exploiting bugs to affect entire communities, like AOL Instant Messenger. Zuckerberg believes in the free flow of information and access to data for everyone.

Hackerism has not only survived but thrived due to its flexibility and adaptability. The current frontier for hackers expands beyond just mathematical realms and involves physical objects like power-generating kites and body parts. DIY biology, manipulating genetic code, has become an area of interest for hackers and is seen as the next revolution in changing the world.

Bill Gates foresees hackers playing a significant role in driving the next revolution and solving complex problems that can positively impact the human condition.
