## Introduction

Barrett Lyon and Andy Crocker emerged as influential figures in cyber defence as they fought against the rising tide of cybercrime in the early 2000s. Their stories, which encompassed interactions with hackers, cooperation with law enforcement agencies, and undercover work for the FBI, shed light on the vast and lucrative cybercrime underground economy. The prevalence of online scams, identity theft, and data breaches underscored the urgent need for improved defences and public awareness.

By 2009, cybercrime had become a global issue with severe financial repercussions and far-reaching implications for international security. Despite their efforts and recognition within government circles, Lyon and Crocker believed that the gravity of the cybercrime problem was still not fully understood. The book serves as a warning, highlighting the ongoing disaster of cybercrime and emphasising the importance of public engagement and understanding in combatting this threat.

The authors advocate for a comprehensive approach to cybersecurity, with increased cooperation, information sharing, and public involvement. The book concludes by urging readers to recognise the significance of cybercrime and take an active role in addressing it, as it continues to undermine the electronic economy and pose challenges to global prosperity and stability.

## Wargames

Barrett Lyon, renowned for his skills in cybersecurity and mitigating denial-of-service attacks, was approached by BetCRIS to defend against a severe cyber attack in 2003. He successfully analysed the attacks and stabilised the company, leading to his decision to start his cybersecurity venture. Despite the rough edges of his potential partners, Barrett believed in their collaboration.

Facing learning disabilities and dyslexia, Barrett's journey showcased his exceptional computer security expertise. He extended his assistance to companies like Don Best Sports, recovering from cyber attacks and tracing perpetrators. These experiences fueled his desire to establish Prolexic Technologies Inc., focusing on defending against domain name server attacks.

As the cyber war intensified, Barrett's naïveté about his partners' backgrounds and intentions became apparent. The complexities and global implications of the undeclared cyber war became evident, highlighting the escalating stakes and the involvement of criminal organisations and governments.


## Hardcore vs Exe

Driven by his determination to track and expose cybercriminals, Barrett Lyon takes matters into his own hands. With limited assistance from the FBI, he relies on his skills and resources, using techniques like SNMP and IRC servers to trace the attackers to Kazakhstan and Russia. As hackers, Barrett establishes a connection with a hacker named eXe, gathering valuable intelligence about his identity and activities.

Barrett shares his findings with the UK's National Hi-Tech Crime Unit (NHTCU) after they discover his efforts to protect companies from DDoS attacks. In collaborative meetings, Barrett provides detailed information about the extortion ring and the hackers' nicknames and locations. The NHTCU firmly commits to combating technology crime and partners with Barrett. Eventually, Barrett uncovers the true identity of eXe as Ivan Maksakov and shares this information with the NHTCU and the FBI. The news of Ivan Maksakov's arrest and two others in Russia marks a significant breakthrough in the pursuit of cybercriminals.

Barrett Lyon's tenacity and collaboration with law enforcement agencies yield significant progress in exposing cybercriminals and dismantling their operations. Despite limited support, his efforts led to identifying and arresting critical individuals involved in cybercrimes, highlighting the importance of public-private partnerships in combating cyber threats.

## In Too Deep

Barrett Lyon delves deeper into gambling as he becomes closely involved with Mickey Richardson and his organisation in Costa Rica. He uncovers Mickey's associates' dual identities and questionable pasts, including Brian Green's history with bookie Steve D. Budin. Barrett's concerns about the integrity of electronic poker and casino games grow as he discovers potential manipulation by gambling companies, raising questions about fairness.

Financial troubles arise for Barrett as he awaits a promised investment from Mickey and Brian. Eventually, he receives a brick of money from Maurice, a contact provided by Mickey. Barrett realises that Prolexic, his company, is being used by Mickey and his crew to launder gambling profits back into the United States. Pressure mounts from Darren and others to relocate Prolexic to south Florida, where Mickey and Brian have connections.

Barrett establishes an office in Hollywood, Florida, but faces challenges obtaining the necessary resources from Darren. He learns that BetCRIS, still owned by Ron Sacco, has ties to the Gambino crime family and operates in Costa Rica. The internet is an avenue for organised crime's involvement in gambling and fraud schemes, with prominent figures like Sacco taking advantage of the less-regulated nature of online operations. Ruth Parasol and her associates, including Seth Warshavsky, also exploit the internet's freedoms for their online gambling and adult entertainment ventures, with PartyGaming achieving success in the online poker market despite legal challenges.

## The Turn

Barrett Lyon wrestled with the moral dilemma of working for a company funded by illegal activities but justified it by using the money to defend companies against extortionists. Prolexic gained recognition for its success in defending against denial-of-service attacks and collaborated closely with law enforcement agencies, sharing valuable information with other security firms. Barrett proposed to Rachelle, but she wanted him to address the ethical concerns surrounding their work and relationship. Barrett aimed to attract non-gambling clients to Prolexic but faced challenges in making significant changes to the company's client base.

Prolexic's revenue increased, but excessive spending and mismanagement persisted, and Barrett had limited access to financial information. The involvement of Mickey Flynn Jr., an investor tied to illegal gambling activities, further complicated matters. Barrett's profile in the security community grew, and he formed connections with industry figures like Jay Adelson and FBI agent Paul Betancourt. However, concerns about Prolexic's association with questionable clients strained relationships within the company and raised ethical concerns.

Frustrated with bad management and a lack of appreciation, Barrett exposed the criminal activities of those around him. He contacted the FBI and provided information on Mickey and Sacco's illegal actions. Barrett left Prolexic and started a new venture called BitGravity, which focused on internet video and partnered with Perry Wu.


## Crackdown

After collaborating with the FBI, Barrett Lyon witnessed a shift in the US government's focus from overseas criminal hackers to targeting American mobsters involved in online gambling. The Justice Department pursued cases against sports gambling outfits tied to organised crime or employing aggressive promotion strategies. This led to the arrest of BetonSports CEO David Carruthers and the subsequent indictment of the company and its founder, Gary Kaplan. Prolexic's name appeared in court records related to a gambling indictment involving the Lucchese crime family and other individuals. This resulted in a raid on Prolexic's office and extensive questioning of employees by law enforcement.

The online poker industry faced challenges and scandals, with concerns about cheating and non-payment of winnings. Industry bodies like the Offshore Gaming Association and the International Sportsbook Council were revealed to be controlled by BetonSports, raising conflicts of interest concerns. Instances of cheating, including automated programs and insider manipulation of games, were exposed in companies like PartyPoker and Absolute Poker—loose regulations in various countries allowed for undetected cheating in online gambling. The passage of the Unlawful Internet Gambling Enforcement Act in 2006 significantly impacted the industry, leading to a decline in poker company stocks and legal issues for companies like Neteller, an online payment system.

Legal pressure intensified on PartyGaming and its co-founders, with guilty pleas and fines being issued. The Unlawful Internet Gambling Enforcement Act introduced regulations impacting credit card companies and processors involved in gambling transactions. Prolexic pleaded guilty to promoting gambling, and investigations targeted individuals associated with the company, including Mickey Richardson and Ron Sacco. Darren Rennick, previously associated with Prolexic, provided valuable information, leading to the indictment of Darren, Mickey, and Sacco by federal and state grand juries. Extradition papers were being prepared as the investigation continued.

## From Spam to Identity Theft

The rise of identity theft and the sophistication of cybercriminals posed significant challenges in combating cybercrime. Russian hackers shifted their focus to identity theft operations, causing financial losses and credit report issues for individuals. Spam played a crucial role in spreading viruses and facilitating criminal activities. Private citizens took alternative measures to combat cybercrime, with individuals like Sven Jaschen creating antivirus viruses in response to the financial motivation behind other viruses. The story highlighted the difficulties faced by law enforcement in addressing cybercrime and the proactive efforts of individuals in combating it.

The commercialisation of hacking emerged, with individuals like Axel Gembe and Lee Walker engaging in hacking activities for profit. Financially motivated denial-of-service attacks caused substantial losses and led to the first prosecution of such an attack in the United States. The enactment of the CAN-SPAM Act inadvertently led spammers to engage in phishing activities, targeting victims through deceptive emails posing as legitimate institutions. Phishers continually improved their techniques, stealing sensitive financial information and putting millions of identities at risk. The need for more urgency in tightening security standards and addressing online identity theft by US banks exacerbated the issue.

The CheckFree Services incident further highlighted the need for a collective effort and reevaluating of the Internet's architecture to combat mass identity theft and the underground economy. Barrett Lyon recognised that fighting an outdated battle was futile and called for multiple governments to work together in addressing the growing challenges posed by cybercrime.

## Whatever It Takes

Barrett Lyon provided crucial information on the BetCRIS cyberattacks to the UK's National Hi-Tech Crime Unit (NHTCU), led by Prime Minister Tony Blair's government. NHTCU agent Andy Crocker played a vital role in the investigation, working to establish international cooperation and confront the challenges posed by Russian authorities. Despite initial scepticism from the FBI and limited initiative in investigating the attacks, progress was made in identifying the perpetrators and their connections to servers in Russia. However, bureaucratic delays and jurisdictional limitations presented obstacles along the way.

With the assistance of General Boris Miroshnikov and Colonel Igor Yakovlev from the Russian MVD's Investigative Committee, the investigation gained momentum. Plans were set in motion to apprehend five prime suspects involved in the distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks and extortion schemes targeting gambling companies. The collaboration between Barrett Lyon, Andy Crocker, and their international counterparts demonstrated the importance of cross-border cooperation in combating cybercrime, despite the enduring tensions and challenges faced in the process.

## The Day of Action

Andy Crocker and Igor Yakovlev executed a coordinated arrest operation targeting Ivan Maksakov and other suspects involved in the cyberattacks. Maksakov's cooperation provided valuable information about the hackers' activities, including their targets, tactics, and technical infrastructure. The investigation revealed a shift in focus from DDoS attacks to identity theft, explicitly targeting betting sites. Maksakov disclosed details about the extortion scheme, money drops, and the use of mules to convert cash into Webmoney.

The involvement of Maksakov, Stepanov, and Petrov solidified their roles in criminal operations while challenges with corrupt officials and elusive hackers persisted. Raids were conducted, but the central server remained elusive, suggesting a possible tip-off. However, actions were taken to turn off the domain name server of Alexander Olegovich Grasman, known as Brain, severing his connection to the botnet and halting ongoing attacks. Despite Brain's attempts to launch new botnets, Andy's team repeatedly shut them down.

It became clear that Brain posed a significant threat, boasting of his immunity to foreign law enforcement in Kazakhstan and focusing on harvesting financial information from individuals. The pursuit of the cybercriminals continued as Andy and his team worked to dismantle their operations and mitigate the harm caused by their activities.

## The Underground Economy

The battle against cybercriminals requires coordinated efforts and international cooperation. Law enforcement agencies target major cybercriminal forums like CarderPlanet and Shadowcrew, apprehending lower-level members and utilising sting operations to infiltrate criminal networks. However, challenges arise due to the ever-changing nature of cybercrime and the reluctance of some countries to cooperate.

The closure of CarderPlanet and Shadowcrew dealt a blow to cybercriminal operations but led to the emergence of smaller, more secretive forums. Breaches of ATM networks and payment processors increased, resulting in significant financial losses. While using informants has yielded successes, there are concerns about collateral damage and potential misuse of computer skills.

Amid these challenges, Andy's deep infiltration into the Russian criminal justice system provides valuable insights into illegal hacking. The fight against cybercrime continues, with the need for continued vigilance and innovative strategies to stay one step ahead of cybercriminals.

## Trial

Andy Crocker and prosecutor Anton Pohamov prepared for the trial against Ivan Maksakov and his co-defendants. The problem occurred in Balakovo, and safety concerns required Andy and Pohamov to stay outside town. Maksakov surprised everyone by pleading not guilty, challenging the previously provided confession. The defence caused delays by challenging evidence, and the trial faced further complications when Petrov secretly took a picture of Andy. The prosecution sought assistance from computer forensics instructors to strengthen their analysis. Timur Arutchev's return became significant, and his testimony led to the defendants being found guilty and sentenced to eight years in prison.

Meanwhile, the British government replaced the National Hi-Tech Crime Unit (NHTCU) with the Serious Organised Crime Agency (SOCA), resulting in less focus on cybercrime. The head of SOCA opted for silence and did not issue press releases about the successful outcome of the Russian case. Andy felt that the trial's accomplishments were not adequately recognised, likening it to the ending of "Raiders of the Lost Ark."

## Beyond Crime

Andy Crocker and Barrett Lyon faced challenges in targeting the leaders of cybercrime after successfully apprehending Russian hackers. The Serious Organised Crime Agency (SOCA) recalled Andy to the UK without a replacement in Russia, hindering further investigations. Corruption and possible political protection made pursuing key targets like Artur Galegov and Alexander Olegovich Grasman difficult. SOCA's lack of support and mishandled investigations frustrated Andy, leading to a realisation that joint investigations would not materialise. Meanwhile, identity theft, phishing attacks, and spyware continued to worsen, with limited assistance from Eastern Bloc countries and ongoing challenges of political protection for cybercriminals.

The Russian Business Network (RBN), linked to organised crime and political figures, posed a significant challenge. RBN provided infrastructure for illegal activities but evaded prosecution due to its operations and connections. Economic factors, political considerations, and corruption hindered effective action against cybercriminals. Eastern European countries faced a lack of career opportunities, contributing to the rise of cybercrime. The alliance between national governments, such as Russia and China, and organised crime raised concerns about state-sponsored cyber espionage. Denial-of-service attacks were used for political purposes, blurring the line between cybercrime, politics, and diplomacy.

The Bush administration needed more focus and investment in cybersecurity, with government networks facing vulnerabilities. It was not until 2008 that cybersecurity became a priority, with President Bush issuing a classified directive. The Obama administration reviewed cybersecurity policies but faced delays in appointing a cybersecurity coordinator, leading to frustrations. Recognising the cybersecurity crisis emphasised the urgency, but concrete steps to combat the evolving cyberwar landscape were yet to be taken.

## Fixing What's Fixable

Efforts to combat cybercrime face numerous challenges, including increasing DDoS attacks, encryption, and online anonymity. Individual actions have a limited impact, and catching the leaders of cybercriminal organisations is challenging. International cooperation, particularly with Russia and former Soviet states, is crucial but requires better understanding and personal relationships. The U.S. should prioritise cybersecurity, promoting collaboration, information sharing, and diplomatic penalties for harbouring cybercriminals.

Turning off primary cyber weapons like botnets and bulletproof servers and cutting off high-speed internet connections is essential. Tracking and disrupting botnet operations can still be effective. Researchers and volunteers have made progress in identifying and blocking IP addresses and domain names associated with cybercrime. Shutting down criminal service providers and implementing stricter verification processes by internet service providers can reduce cybercrime. Consumer education on cybersecurity is essential.

Accountability and liability should be established for software producers, along with laws on data breach disclosure and encryption of sensitive information. Banks and merchants should implement more robust identity verification measures. The executive branch should prioritise cybersecurity, improve cooperation, and hire technology specialists. Privacy concerns must be balanced with the need for inspection and protection against cyber threats. Computer Emergency Response Teams (CERT) can enhance internet security in every country. A comprehensive assessment of the current system is necessary for long-term improvement.

Investments in hardware-assisted security, reducing browser vulnerabilities, and establishing international legal frameworks are essential for enhancing internet security. Disconnecting from certain countries or networks is not a foolproof solution. Privacy concerns limit the feasibility of a mandatory identification system for Internet users. Enhanced internet infrastructure with improved security measures is needed. Research for a new internet protocol should be prioritised to address flaws in network neutrality, security, DDoS attacks, and scaling problems.

## Epilogue

After retiring from the Serious Organised Crime Agency (SOCA), Andy Crocker founded Cyber Security Shield, a private company dedicated to defending against botnets. Despite their notable case, Andy's critical allies in Russia, Igor Yakovlev and Anton Pohamov, did not experience successful careers, and further trials were not pursued. Meanwhile, Barrett Lyon's company, BitGravity, succeeded in Silicon Valley, attracting clients like YouTube and gaining recognition as one of the top ten start-ups. However, Barrett faced conflicts with BitGravity's CEO and eventually had to leave the company.

Undeterred, Barrett conceived a new idea that combined content delivery networks and botnet knowledge. He aimed to leverage idle PC and network capacity for storage and processing. Frustrated by the lack of progress from the FBI in apprehending members of the Costa Rica group, Barrett shifted his focus to his new venture, 3Crowd Technologies. He believed that 3Crowd could become the world's largest botnet.

During this time, the Defense Department announced the establishment of a Cyber Command, and Barrett and Andy took part in a secret conference focused on combating terrorism. Although Barrett declined an offer to provide offensive hacking tools, he remained committed to advancing his content-delivery company and pursuing his vision for utilising botnet capabilities.
