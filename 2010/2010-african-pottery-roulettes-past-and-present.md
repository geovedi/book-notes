# African Pottery Roulettes Past and Present
**Original Title**: African Pottery Roulettes Past and Present: Techniques, Identification and Distribution
**Editors**: Anne Haour, Olivier Gosselain, Kevin MacDonald, Katie Manning, Alexandre Livingstone Smith | **Year**: 2010

## Summary
This comprehensive academic work examines the fascinating tradition of roulette decoration in African pottery - a technique where various objects are impressed onto clay vessels before firing. The book presents a revolutionary approach focusing on the tools (the "cause") rather than just the decorative patterns (the "effect"), offering archaeologists a systematic framework for identifying and classifying these decorative implements that have been used across Africa for millennia.

The volume bridges the gap between ethnographic present and archaeological past, documenting how contemporary African potters continue ancient traditions using everything from twisted cords and carved wooden cylinders to fish bones, palm fibers, and even bicycle springs. This living tradition provides unique insights into Africa's ceramic history, offering direct parallels to archaeological practices that have disappeared elsewhere in the world.

Archaeologists, anthropologists, and museum curators will discover a groundbreaking classification system that facilitates inter-regional comparisons across Africa's vast and diverse ceramic landscape. The book combines extensive field research with archaeological analysis to create practical tools for identifying pottery decorations and understanding their social and cultural significance.

## Core Insights

### The Roulette Revolution: Focusing on Tools, Not Just Patterns
The book's central innovation is shifting analytical focus from decorative patterns to the tools that create them. This "cause rather than effect" approach recognizes that the same visual pattern can be produced by different implements, making tool identification crucial for accurate archaeological interpretation.

> "Roulettes have been associated with pottery assemblages of the continent for millennia, and today comprise a range of objects, from twisted pieces of cord to carved wooden cylinders; from fish bones to hair curlers; from folded sections of palm fibre to bicycle springs."

**Quick Take**: By understanding how decorations were made, not just what they look like, archaeologists can make more accurate cultural connections and chronological assessments.

### A Living Tradition Linking Past and Present
Unlike other regions where roulette decoration has vanished, Africa maintains this practice across an area "about the size of the United States." This continuity provides unparalleled opportunities to understand ancient techniques through modern practice.

The authors document how roulettes represent "the epitome of technical diversity" in pottery decoration, with variations in materials, manipulation methods, and application techniques reflecting complex social and cultural traditions.

**Quick Take**: Africa's living pottery traditions serve as a bridge between past and present, offering unique insights into ancient ceramic practices that have disappeared elsewhere.

### Technology as Social Identity
The book reveals how pottery techniques, including roulette decoration, function as markers of social identity. Research shows that vessel-forming techniques tend to reflect deep-rooted aspects of identity (kinship, language, gender), while decorative attributes may signal more fluid, situational aspects.

> "The way in which potters are socialised into the craft leads them to view shaping technique as both an 'inheritance' and a materialisation of their social affiliation."

**Quick Take**: Pottery techniques are not just technical choices but expressions of cultural identity, social relationships, and community affiliations.

### Classification Framework: Material, Manipulation, Application
The book introduces a systematic classification system based on three key characteristics: the material of which the roulette is made, the manipulation performed on that material, and the manner of application to the vessel.

This framework provides archaeologists with a standardized language for describing roulette types, facilitating comparative studies across regions and time periods. The system ranges from simple twisted cords to complex braided tools, covering the full spectrum of African roulette diversity.

**Quick Take**: A standardized classification system enables researchers to communicate clearly about roulette types and make meaningful comparisons across different archaeological contexts.

### Challenges in Archaeological Recognition
The authors address the significant challenges in identifying roulette types from archaeological remains, noting that visual perception of patterns differs from actual knowledge of how decorations were made.

They document cases where potters copied roulette motifs using familiar tools, misinterpreting the original techniques. This highlights the importance of understanding both the technical processes and the social context of pottery production.

**Quick Take**: Archaeological interpretation requires careful attention to both visual patterns and the technical knowledge behind their creation.

## Best Quotes

- "This was a peak in what could stand as the biggest 'success story' in the history of pottery decoration in Africa."

- "Nowadays, rouletting tools continue be used in most of this area, but we are also witnessing their progressive decline, not simply because pottery vessels are increasingly replaced by metal and plastic containers, but because of a loss of popularity against new decorative fashions, such as painted motifs."

- "In most other areas of the world where rouletting was practised in the past, there exist no contemporary parallels. African examples therefore provide a link between past and present."

- "Only by privileging a consideration of the tool, and by including a good database of images, can we hope to discern the defining characteristics of the various types of impressed decoration: and thus identify any ruptures or continuities between types."

- "Style allows us to ask what cultural diversity actually is, and how it is socially constituted and maintained."

## Practical Applications

- **Field Identification**: Use the three-part classification system (material, manipulation, application) to systematically record roulette types during archaeological excavations
- **Comparative Analysis**: Apply the standardized terminology to enable meaningful comparisons between different archaeological sites and regions
- **Ethnographic Documentation**: Record contemporary pottery-making practices before they disappear, focusing on the complete chaîne opératoire of roulette production
- **Chronological Sequences**: Develop more precise pottery chronologies by understanding the technical relationships between different roulette types
- **Social Identity Studies**: Use pottery decoration patterns to investigate questions of cultural interaction, population movement, and social change

## Questions to Consider

- How do technical choices in pottery decoration reflect broader patterns of cultural identity and social interaction?
- What can the distribution of specific roulette types tell us about ancient trade routes and cultural exchanges?
- How might the decline of traditional pottery techniques impact our understanding of Africa's archaeological record?
- In what ways do modern pottery traditions preserve or transform ancient technical knowledge?
- How can archaeologists better integrate technical analysis with broader interpretations of cultural change?

## Conclusion

This groundbreaking volume represents a major advance in African ceramic studies, offering both methodological innovation and deep cultural insight. The systematic approach to roulette classification provides archaeologists with powerful tools for interpreting Africa's rich pottery traditions, while the integration of ethnographic and archaeological data creates a unique bridge between past and present.

The book's significance extends beyond technical pottery analysis to address fundamental questions about cultural identity, technological transmission, and social change. By focusing on the tools of decoration rather than just the patterns, the authors reveal how technical choices reflect complex social relationships and cultural traditions.

For anyone working with African ceramics, this volume is essential reading that will transform how they look at pottery decorations and understand their cultural significance. The comprehensive classification system, extensive photographic documentation, and theoretical framework make it an invaluable resource for both field archaeologists and museum specialists.

**Worth Your Time?** Absolutely. This is not just a technical manual but a profound exploration of how material culture reflects and shapes human social relationships. The biggest reason to read it is to gain a new perspective on how to read pottery - not just as decorative objects, but as expressions of cultural identity and technical knowledge.
