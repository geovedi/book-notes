# Keeping the Bees
**Author**: Laurence Packer | **Year**: 2010 | **Category**: Science & Nature

## Summary
"Keeping the Bees" reveals the urgent crisis facing bee populations worldwide and explains why these tiny insects are crucial to human survival. Packer, a lifelong melittologist (bee biologist), takes readers on a global journey from the Atacama Desert to Cape Breton Island, showing how bees pollinate one-third of our food supply and are essential for healthy ecosystems.

This book is perfect for environmentally conscious readers, gardeners, and anyone who wants to understand the hidden crisis threatening our food systems. You'll gain practical knowledge about protecting bees and appreciate these remarkable creatures in ways you never imagined.

## Core Insights

### Bee Diversity: The 19,000 Species We Overlook
Most people think of honey bees when they hear "bee," but there are actually over 19,000 bee species worldwide, each with unique behaviors and adaptations. Unlike the familiar honey bee that lives in massive colonies, most bees are solitary creatures, with 90% of species living alone rather than in hives. These solitary bees are often better pollinators for specific plants than honey bees.

> "Of the more than nineteen thousand known species of bees, only the females of less than 75 percent of them are capable of stinging us, and most of them have a sting that causes pain for only a few minutes."

**Quick Take**: Bees are incredibly diverse, and this diversity makes our ecosystems more resilient to threats.

### The Pollination Crisis: Our Food at Risk
Bees are essential for pollinating approximately one-third of the food we eat, including many fruits, vegetables, and nuts. The book reveals alarming statistics: without bees, we wouldn't have almonds, apples, blueberries, squash, or even chocolate (cacao requires bee pollination). Even meat and dairy products depend on bees indirectly through alfalfa pollination for livestock feed.

The current reliance on honey bees as industrial pollinators is dangerously fragile. Colony Collapse Disorder (CCD) and other threats to honey bee populations put our entire food system at risk.

> "Whatever the cause or causes of CCD, it is yet another indication that relying on just one organism to provide almost all our pollination needs is an unwise strategy."

**Quick Take**: Diversifying our pollination strategy with multiple bee species is essential for food security.

### The Triple Threat: Pesticides, Habitat Loss, and Climate Change
Bees face three major anthropogenic threats. Pesticides, particularly neonicotinoids, devastate bee populations even at sub-lethal doses. Habitat fragmentation destroys nesting sites and food sources. Climate change disrupts the delicate timing between bee emergence and flower blooming.

Packer explains how bees in deserts and diverse habitats are more vulnerable because they often specialize on specific plants, making them less adaptable to environmental changes.

> "Pesticide use is not the only thing reducing the number of species on the planet. The three anthropogenic impacts that conservation biologists think are the most important are climate change, invasive species and habitat fragmentation."

**Quick Take**: Protecting bees requires addressing all three threats simultaneously through systemic changes.

### The Secret Life of Bees: Nature's Most Fascinating Behaviors
The book reveals extraordinary bee behaviors that rival any nature documentary. There are bees that line their nests with cellophane-like material, others that are "sexually transmitted child-eating female impersonators" (parasitic beetle larvae that trick male bees), and bees that perform complex dances and communication rituals.

Desert bees have evolved remarkable strategies to survive unpredictable environments, often specializing on specific plants and emerging only when conditions are perfect. Some bees can recognize individual human faces, while others navigate using polarized light patterns invisible to humans.

> "These nest parasites are sexually transmitted. If that sounds rather icky, it gets worse when you imagine that the interaction between bee and beetle larvae is akin to you chatting up some attractive person at a bar and then finding that he or she has disintegrated into seven hundred rat-sized parasites that attach themselves to your back."

**Quick Take**: Bees are far more complex and interesting than most people realize, making them worth protecting for their intrinsic value alone.

### Urban Bee Havens: Cities as Unexpected Sanctuaries
Surprisingly, urban areas often provide better bee habitat than intensively farmed rural areas. A single city block with diverse gardens, flowering plants, and various nesting sites can support over 100 bee species. Packer's own Toronto backyard hosts more than 30 species, thanks to wooden structures, raspberry canes, and soft brickwork that provide nesting sites.

The key is habitat complexity—different flowers bloom at different times, various materials offer nesting opportunities, and minimal pesticide use creates a safe environment.

**Quick Take**: Cities can become vital refuges for bee populations if designed and maintained thoughtfully.

## Best Quotes

- "Your grandchildren may depend upon it."

- "If you want to find an ecologically complex single square kilometre, you would be hard-pressed to improve upon an old city's downtown neighbourhoods, assuming that the inhabitants are more interested in gardening than they are in covering their property in concrete."

- "When I stop and smell the roses, I will now tarry a little longer and look at the bee that is pollinating the flowers."

- "The areas where I have found the greatest diversity and density of bees are the rural regions of the Dordogne in France and some of the hillsides in the disputed territory currently in northern Israel."

- "Bees are actually almost everywhere—wherever there are flowers, there will usually be bees."

## Action Items

- **Plant native flowers**: Choose a variety of native plants that bloom throughout the season to provide continuous food sources for bees.

- **Provide nesting sites**: Leave some bare soil for ground-nesting bees, install bee hotels, or preserve dead wood and plant stems for cavity-nesting species.

- **Avoid pesticides**: Eliminate or drastically reduce pesticide use in your garden and lawn. If necessary, use bee-friendly alternatives and apply them when bees aren't active.

- **Create diverse habitats**: Mix different flower types, heights, and blooming times. Include some "weeds" like dandelions that provide early spring food.

- **Support organic farming**: Choose organic produce whenever possible to support farming practices that protect bee habitats and reduce pesticide exposure.

- **Educate others**: Share what you learn about bees with friends, family, and community members to build broader support for bee conservation.

## Questions to Consider

- How would your daily diet change if bee pollination disappeared? What foods would you lose?

- What small changes could you make in your yard or balcony to create better bee habitat?

- How can we balance agricultural productivity with bee conservation in your local community?

- What role should governments play in protecting pollinator habitats and regulating harmful pesticides?

- How might indigenous knowledge, like the Mayan bee worship ceremonies, inform modern conservation approaches?

## Conclusion
"Keeping the Bees" is a wake-up call disguised as a fascinating journey into the world of bees. Packer's passion for his subjects is contagious, and his scientific expertise makes the case for bee conservation undeniable. The book succeeds in transforming readers from passive observers into potential bee advocates.

The biggest reason to read this book is its perfect blend of urgency and hope. While the threats facing bees are serious and immediate, Packer provides clear, actionable solutions that anyone can implement. You'll finish with both the knowledge to understand the crisis and the tools to be part of the solution.
