# My Weekly Devotional for Daily Struggles
**Authors**: Phillip Tomasso | **Year**: 2025

## Summary
"My Weekly Devotional for Daily Struggles" is a 52-week Christian devotional that addresses the real, everyday challenges of faith through honest personal testimony and biblical wisdom. Written by Phillip Tomasso, a 911 dispatcher and author of over 30 novels, this devotional stands out for its raw authenticity and vulnerability. Tomasso doesn't present himself as having achieved spiritual perfection but as someone actively wrestling with the same doubts, fears, and failures that many Christians face daily.

Each week focuses on a specific struggle—from finding strength in weakness and dealing with uncertainty to battling internal enemies and learning to forgive—anchoring every reflection in relevant scripture. The author's background as someone who spent fifteen years away from God, pursuing selfish ambitions in writing and publishing, adds depth to his insights about grace, transformation, and redemption.

This devotional is perfect for Christians who struggle with feeling inadequate in their faith, those facing persistent doubts and temptations, or anyone seeking honest companionship in their spiritual journey. Readers will find practical wisdom for turning to God in moments of weakness, understanding trials as opportunities for growth, and discovering that God's grace works most powerfully through our imperfections.

## Core Insights

### Finding Strength in Weakness
Drawing from Joshua 1:6-9, Tomasso explores the paradox of Christian strength: we are strongest when we admit our weakness and depend on God. The author wears a cross engraved with "Be strong and courageous" as a daily reminder, yet honestly admits his fears feel "never-ending." He shares the terrifying thought that his constant failures might cause God to turn away, using Moses as an example of how even great leaders face consequences. The key insight is that strength comes not from perfect performance but from persistent trust in God's presence and patience.

> "Lord, I pray, with Your help, I can do better. Each day, I pray I can at least do better than I did the day before."
**Quick Take**: True courage isn't the absence of fear, but choosing to trust God despite your fears.

### The Purpose of Trials
Using James 1:2-4, Tomasso tackles one of Christianity's hardest teachings: finding joy in suffering. He admits, "It is hard to find pure joy in pain when I am suffering," but discovers that trials test and strengthen faith, producing perseverance. Like students pulling all-nighters for exams or gym-goers pushing through pain for fitness, spiritual struggles develop our character. The author connects perseverance to patience and maturity, emphasizing that God isn't trying to punish us but perfect us.

> "I am learning to find joy in these tests. Often, I come up short. The more I think about it, the more I believe perseverance is about patience."
**Quick Take**: Your current struggle might be God's training ground for future strength.

### Humility and Authentic Faith
Throughout the devotional, Tomasso repeatedly returns to the danger of performing spirituality for others. He candidly shares his past struggles with wanting recognition for his writing accomplishments, admitting, "I gave no glory to God for the books I'd written." He contrasts this with the biblical call to humble ourselves before God, sharing honestly about fears, failures, and needs. True humility isn't thinking less of yourself, but thinking of yourself less and God more.

> "Dear God, why is it so hard for me to do the right things for the right reasons without the need to brag, highlight, and post on social media about what it is I have done?"
**Quick Take**: Real faith grows in the secret places where only God sees.

### The Power of Focused Prayer
Inspired by Daniel's prayer life, Tomasso emphasizes giving God undivided attention in prayer. He admits struggling with distracted prayer—TV on, phone in hand, eyes open—but discovered transformation when he "turns to the Lord God" with focused devotion. The author describes prayer as a conversation where God "is always ready to listen" and deserves our full attention. This isn't about formulaic prayer but authentic communication that strengthens relationship with God.

> "When you pray, focus all of your heart and attention on God. Give him that level of respect! He deserves your full attention."
**Quick Take**: Prayer quality matters more than prayer quantity.

### Grace as Identity Foundation
In the final week, Tomasso contrasts Popeye's famous "I yam what I yam" with Paul's "By the grace of God, I am what I am." He shares his journey from self-promotion to God-glorification, explaining how recognizing God's grace transformed his identity. The author's fifteen-year hiatus from writing wasn't about giving up dreams but about letting God reshape his purposes. True identity comes not from our achievements but from God's grace working through us.

> "But by the grace of God I am what I am, and His grace to me was not without effect. No, I worked harder than all of them—yet not I, but the grace of God that was with me."
**Quick Take**: Your worth isn't measured by your accomplishments but by God's grace.
