## Epilogue
- LeoLabs and Low Earth Orbit Monitoring
  - LeoLabs, a Silicon Valley company, built a network of radar stations to track objects in low Earth orbit.
  - The network tracked satellites, rocket bodies, and debris, even objects as small as centimeters.
  - Traditional government monitoring systems couldn't keep up with the increasing space activities.
  - LeoLabs aimed to prevent collisions by monitoring satellites' paths and providing collision alerts to companies.
- Commercial Space and SpaceX's Dominance
  - LeoLabs is part of the new commercial space race focused on managing low Earth orbit.
  - SpaceX emerged as a dominant player with its impressive rockets and satellite launches.
  - The commercial space industry received significant investments, but economic realities affected its growth.
  - While some doubt the sustainability of the commercial space bubble, technological evolution is expected.
