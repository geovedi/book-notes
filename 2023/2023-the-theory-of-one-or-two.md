# The Theory of One or Two
**Original Title**: De theorie van de 1 of 2
**Author**: Ismail 'Ish' Ait Hamou | **Year**: 2023
**Category**: Fiction & Literature

## Summary
This profound essay explores the psychological and social dynamics faced by the Moroccan-Belgian community through the author's personal experiences. Ait Hamou introduces "the theory of 'the 1 or 2'" – a framework explaining how limited opportunities for minority representation create internal community tension, jealousy, and psychological barriers. The book reveals how when society allows only one or two people from a marginalized group to succeed, it transforms potential allies into competitors and creates a toxic dynamic where success becomes threatening rather than celebratory.

For anyone seeking to understand the subtle mechanisms of discrimination, the psychology of tokenism, and the internal challenges faced by minority communities, this book offers invaluable insights. It's particularly essential for those interested in identity politics, integration issues, and the hidden costs of limited diversity.

## Core Insights

### The Outside Bouncer Mentality
The book opens with a powerful personal anecdote about trying to enter a nightclub that only allowed "1 or 2" Moroccans inside. When the author finally gets in, he realizes his success feels like betrayal to his friends waiting outside. This experience becomes a metaphor for how society systematically limits minority access to success spaces, creating psychological trauma that leads people to stop wanting what they can't have.

> "We switched on our self-defense mechanism: we stopped making important what we desired, and we went about tempering our expectations... I began to believe that I didn't like going out. The deep bass sounds of hip-hop suddenly became too loud, the hundreds of dancing bodies too oppressive."

**Quick Take**: When success spaces are systematically closed to you, your survival instincts may reprogram your ambitions to protect you from repeated rejection.

### The Inheritance of Silence
The author explores how the first generation of Moroccan immigrants internalized their pain and trauma without sharing it with their children. This silence about their struggles created unrealistic expectations and emotional distance between generations. The concept of *Sabr* (patience/perseverance) was passed down, but often interpreted passively rather than as a tool for active problem-solving.

> "We had little knowledge of the fear, pain and uncertainties of our parents. In our children's eyes, they were superheroes. Superheroes who had given us 'another world'. A beautiful and super romantic image, but one that saddled my generation with a virtually impossible task: becoming worthy children of these parents."

**Quick Take**: Unspoken trauma doesn't disappear – it transforms into inherited anxiety and unrealistic expectations across generations.

### The Poison of Limited Representation
The central thesis reveals how when society allows only "1 or 2" people from a minority group to succeed in any field, it creates internal community toxicity. Instead of celebrating each other's success, community members view successful individuals with suspicion and resentment, expecting them to single-handedly open doors for everyone else.

> "When someone from our Moroccan community finds a beautiful job, becomes famous or takes up a high position, and thus becomes a '1 or 2', you would expect us to celebrate this among ourselves. But much more often, that victory leads to disappointment in our community. And to jealousy."

**Quick Take**: Limited diversity spaces don't just harm those excluded – they poison community relationships and transform potential allies into competitors.

### The Burden of the Token Representative
Those who become "the 1 or 2" carry impossible expectations from both their community and the dominant society. They must simultaneously prove their worth while representing their entire community, often without the luxury of nuance or error. This creates intense pressure to conform and avoid controversial positions.

> "We have to make do with 'the 1 or 2', he or she must often be scientist-journalist-imam-artist-journalist-Belgian-Muslim-terror-expert-Fleming and Moroccan in one... He or she must know everything about Islam and the Moroccan community, give all the right answers, bring all possible nuances."

**Quick Take**: Token representation places impossible burdens on individuals to be perfect representatives of entire communities while denying them the grace of complexity and individuality.

Ait Hamou's theory of "the 1 or 2" provides a powerful framework for understanding why marginalized communities sometimes struggle with internal tension and resentment despite shared oppression.
