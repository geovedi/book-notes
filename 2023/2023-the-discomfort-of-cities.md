# The Discomfort of Cities
**Original Title**: El malestar de las ciudades
**Author**: Jorge Dioni López | **Year**: 2023
**Category**: Philosophy & Critical Thinking

## Summary
"The Discomfort of Cities" is a powerful critique of how neoliberal urban policies have transformed cities from spaces of human connection and diversity into economic products that prioritize profit over people. Dioni argues that modern cities are experiencing a profound crisis—what he terms "discomfort"—as they become increasingly privatized, financialized, and segregated, leading to the expulsion of long-term residents and the erosion of public life.

The book reveals how cities have been systematically redesigned to serve market interests rather than community needs. Through privatization of public spaces, gentrification, touristification, and financial speculation, cities have lost their essential character as places where diverse people connect and create culture together. Instead, they've become platforms for capital accumulation and consumer experiences.

This book is essential for urban planners, policy makers, activists, and anyone concerned about the future of cities. Readers will gain a deep understanding of how economic ideologies shape urban spaces and discover why cities feel increasingly alienating despite their apparent vibrancy and activity.

## Core Insights

### The Neoliberal City: From Living Space to Economic Product
The fundamental transformation of cities from places to live to economic products represents the core of urban discomfort. Dioni explains that neoliberal ideology has redefined the city as "what produces value" rather than "what happens in the city." This shift means cities no longer prioritize human connections, diversity, and community, but instead focus on constant movement, consumption, and capital accumulation.

> _Original: "Una ciudad es lo que sucede en la ciudad. Es lo más parecido a nuestro cerebro, lo importante son las conexiones."_
**Quick Take**: When cities prioritize economic value over human connection, they become stages for performance rather than homes for living.

### The Great Expulsion: How People Are Forced Out
Contrary to popular belief, many cities are experiencing depopulation and aging despite appearing crowded and vibrant. Dioni reveals that the visible activity in cities often masks the departure of longtime residents—particularly families with children—who can no longer afford to live there. This "expulsion" happens through multiple mechanisms: rising housing costs, conversion of residential units to tourist accommodations, and the systematic prioritization of visitor experiences over resident needs.

> "Por qué se va la gente de las ciudades? Porque la echan."
> _Original: "Por qué se va la gente de las ciudades? Porque la echan."_
**Quick Take**: Urban development policies that prioritize tourism and investment over housing affordability systematically displace the very communities that give cities their character.

### Privatization: The Theft of Public Space
The gradual privatization of public spaces represents one of the most visible symptoms of urban discomfort. Parks, squares, sidewalks, and streets that were once freely accessible to all citizens are increasingly controlled, restricted, or commercialized. This privatization creates a two-tiered system where access to public life depends on one's ability to pay, effectively excluding those without economic resources from full participation in urban life.

> _Original: "Nos sentimos robados en nuestra propia casa."_
**Quick Take**: When public spaces become private commodities, the fundamental democratic principle of equal access to the city is compromised.

### Tourism as Urban Colonialism
Dioni analyzes how mass tourism functions as a form of urban colonialism, transforming entire neighborhoods into visitor experiences while pushing out local residents. The "touristification" of cities creates a permanent state of festival where local life must adapt to tourist demands rather than community needs. This phenomenon is particularly acute in historical centers, where authentic urban life is replaced by a curated experience for visitors.

> _Original: "todo el año es San Fermín"_
**Quick Take**: When tourism becomes the dominant urban force, cities sacrifice their authentic character and resident quality of life for visitor satisfaction.

### The Middle Class Suicide
Perhaps the book's most provocative argument is that the middle class "committed suicide as a collective to maintain their individual property." Dioni argues that middle-class residents, seduced by the promise of property appreciation and investment returns, supported neoliberal policies that ultimately destroyed the very public services and social infrastructure that had enabled their rise. This paradox—supporting policies that undermine one's own long-term interests—explains why many urban residents continue to support development models that make their lives more difficult.

> "La clase media se suicidó como colectivo para mantener su propiedad individual."
> _Original: "La clase media se suicidó como colectivo para mantener su propiedad individual."_
**Quick Take**: The pursuit of individual property wealth can lead middle-class communities to support policies that ultimately undermine the public infrastructure and social stability that created their prosperity.

## Action Items

- **Defend Public Spaces**: Actively support and use public spaces in your community. Organize community events, demand adequate maintenance, and resist privatization efforts that limit public access.

- **Support Affordable Housing**: Advocate for policies that prioritize housing for residents over tourist accommodations and investment properties. Support measures that limit short-term rental conversions and protect long-term tenants.

- **Promote Local Economy**: Choose local businesses over chains, support cultural initiatives that serve residents rather than tourists, and participate in community organizations that work to preserve neighborhood character.

- **Question Development Proposals**: Critically examine urban development projects that promise growth and investment but may lead to displacement and gentrification. Demand community benefit agreements and affordable housing requirements.

## Questions to Consider

- What happens to democracy when cities become products rather than communities?
- Can cities remain vibrant and economically successful without becoming exclusionary?
- How do we balance the benefits of tourism with the needs of residents?
- What role should public institutions play in ensuring equitable access to urban resources?
- Is it possible to create economically sustainable cities that don't rely on perpetual growth and expansion?

## Conclusion
"The Discomfort of Cities" is essential reading for anyone who has felt increasingly alienated in their own city or wondered why urban spaces feel more like consumer experiences than communities. Dioni provides a compelling framework for understanding how neoliberal economic policies have systematically transformed cities from places of human connection to platforms for capital accumulation.

The book's greatest strength is its ability to connect seemingly unrelated urban phenomena—rising housing costs, touristification, privatization of public spaces, and the proliferation of empty luxury apartments—into a coherent critique of neoliberal urbanism. Dioni shows how these are not isolated problems but interconnected symptoms of a fundamental shift in how we think about and organize city life.

While the book offers few concrete solutions, its analysis is powerful enough to make readers question their assumptions about urban development and consider alternatives that prioritize human well-being over economic growth. The discomfort Dioni describes is not inevitable—it is the result of specific policy choices that can be reversed.

This book is worth your time if you're concerned about the future of cities, interested in urban policy, or simply trying to understand why modern urban life feels increasingly disconnected from human needs and desires. It provides the vocabulary and framework needed to articulate what many feel but cannot explain about the state of contemporary cities.

The biggest reason to read this book is its urgent message that cities are at a crossroads: we can continue down the path of commodification and exclusion, or we can reclaim cities as democratic spaces where diverse people can build authentic lives together. The choice, as Dioni reminds us, is ultimately ours.
