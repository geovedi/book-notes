## A Message for the Meantime
In the chapter "A Message for the Meantime," the author explores different perspectives on time and its implications for our lives. The chapter begins by discussing the Greek concepts of time, "chronos" and "kairos," which represent linear time and qualitative, opportune timing, respectively. The author argues that understanding these different notions of time is crucial for addressing climate nihilism and other challenges related to time.

The author delves into the personal experience of grappling with time, highlighting the anxiety and nihilism often associated with the linear concept of chronos. In contrast, they find hope and possibility in the qualitative nature of kairos, emphasizing the unpredictability of action and the potential for change in every moment. The distinction between these two perspectives on time is seen as essential for reimagining the future and taking meaningful action.

The chapter also explores the connection between time and justice. The author highlights the historical distinction made between European colonizers and colonized people, relegating the latter to a state of permanence within chronos. This perspective not only justified exploitation but also contributed to the climate crisis and current racial injustices. Recognizing the agency of all beings and co-creating time together is seen as an issue of justice and practicality, particularly in the context of the climate crisis.

The author reflects on their personal search for a conception of time that transcends anxiety and fear. Through observations of natural processes and shedding experiences, they find a sense of renewal and a lifeline to a different future. They discuss the role of experiences, such as watching a sunrise or exploring a volcano, and how they can be consumed and commodified in the experience economy. However, they also emphasize the importance of genuine encounters and the potential for transformative moments that defy the dominant language of time.

The chapter concludes by acknowledging the limitations of the book in providing immediate solutions to time-related challenges. Instead, it offers conceptual tools and encourages a shift in perspective on time. The author emphasizes the need for collective action, structural changes, and engagement with activists, policy writers, and cultural shifts. They argue for the potential of doubt and the exploration of alternative ideas of value, responsibility, and kinship in reshaping our understanding of time. Ultimately, the chapter presents a message of hope and a call to reclaim time as a force of invention and possibility.


## Whose Time, Whose Money?
In the chapter "Whose Time, Whose Money?" the author explores the relationship between time and labor, highlighting the ways in which time has been commodified and controlled within capitalist systems. The chapter delves into historical perspectives on time management, drawing on examples from the industrial revolution and the rise of scientific management.

The author discusses the concept of Taylorism, named after Frederick Winslow Taylor, who developed principles of efficient labor management. Taylorism aimed to maximize productivity by breaking down tasks into small, repetitive motions and measuring workers' performance. This approach treated time as a valuable resource and sought to extract maximum output from workers.

The chapter examines how companies like UPS and Amazon have implemented time and motion studies to optimize their operations. The focus is on minimizing the time required for tasks, as time directly translates into money for these businesses. The author also explores the rise of automation and robotics, which have replaced human workers in some industries, while in others, humans are expected to emulate machines.

The dehumanizing effects of automation are discussed, highlighting the physical and mental toll it takes on workers. The author references personal experiences and accounts from workers engaged in monotonous and algorithmic jobs, such as content moderation. These workers often face traumatic content while dealing with strict time constraints and oppressive work conditions.

The chapter emphasizes that time is not just a resource for employers; individuals also internalize the notion of time as work. The commodification of time leads to a perception of oneself as a constant source of labor. This perspective limits individuals' understanding of time and perpetuates an unbalanced power dynamic between employers and workers.

The author concludes by questioning the prevailing industrial view of time as money, arguing that it overlooks the richness and complexity of human experiences. The chapter invites readers to challenge the dominant paradigm and consider alternative approaches to time and labor that prioritize well-being and a broader understanding of human existence beyond productivity.


## Self Timer
The chapter "Self Timer" explores the concept of time, productivity, and the pressure to constantly optimize one's life. It delves into the cultural obsession with busyness and the belief that success is achieved through relentless work and self-improvement.

The chapter begins by examining the phrase "pulling oneself up by one's bootstraps," which originally referred to an impossible task but later became a metaphor for achieving success through individual effort. The author highlights how this notion perpetuates the idea that personal success is solely determined by one's own actions and ignores the role of external factors and systemic inequalities.

The chapter discusses the influence of eugenics, a belief system popular in the early 20th century that aimed to improve the genetic quality of the human population. The eugenics movement promoted the idea of optimizing human potential and was intertwined with the rhetoric of self-improvement and personal efficiency.

The author draws parallels between the eugenics movement and the self-improvement literature of the time, particularly in magazines like Physical Culture. These publications promoted the ideals of physical fitness, measurements, and the pursuit of a "perfect" body. They emphasized the importance of physical health and mental vitality, connecting them to financial success and social Darwinism.

The chapter highlights the deep-rooted cultural values of speed, efficiency, and progress in American society. It explores how these values are ingrained in the concept of time and how being constantly busy and pursuing endless expansion is seen as virtuous. The author argues that this ideal is tied to whiteness and reinforces a particular vision of success.

The chapter explores the concept of burnout and its different manifestations for individuals with varying levels of privilege. It discusses how individuals like "Linda" (representing the privileged) may experience burnout differently from those who are socially and economically precarious. However, it also emphasizes that both forms of burnout share a common cause rooted in the cultural expectations of constant productivity and expansion.

The chapter concludes by discussing the "lying flat" movement in China, where individuals choose to reject the pressure to constantly work and instead prioritize leisure and minimalism. It also addresses the notion of "giving up" and redefining success within the limits of one's own life, highlighting the importance of recognizing privilege and the shared cause of resisting the dominant culture of busyness and productivity.


## Can There Be Leisure?
In the chapter "Can There Be Leisure?", the author explores the concept of leisure and its relationship with work, society, and personal well-being. They begin by examining how leisure has been commodified in the modern world, turning free time into a marketable product through the experience economy. The author also discusses the impact of technology, particularly social media, on our perception of leisure, noting how it often blurs the line between work and leisure and fosters a constant need for productivity and engagement.

The chapter then delves into the historical and cultural dimensions of leisure, highlighting the unequal distribution of leisure time and its association with power dynamics. The author reflects on the experiences of marginalized communities, such as birdwatchers of color, who face systemic obstacles and prejudice even in seemingly leisurely activities. They also discuss how leisure spaces, like national parks, can be exclusionary and fail to address the histories of violence and oppression associated with their creation.

The author challenges traditional notions of leisure as a passive escape from work, instead proposing a more nuanced and politically engaged understanding. They emphasize the importance of leisure as a time for reflection, questioning the boundaries of work, and addressing collective grief and injustice. The chapter examines historical movements for shorter work hours and highlights the desire for freedom and control over one's own time.

Throughout the chapter, the author intertwines personal anecdotes, conversations with activists, and observations of the natural world to illustrate the complexities of leisure and its potential for both liberation and subjugation. They explore the significance of moments when leisure interrupts the dominant culture of work, allowing individuals to experience gratitude, awe, and a deeper sense of their own humanity.


## Putting Time Back in Its Place
In the chapter "Putting Time Back in Its Place," the author explores the concept of time from various perspectives and challenges the dominant Western notion of time as a linear and objective entity. The chapter emphasizes the importance of understanding time in relation to culture, nature, and subjective experiences.

The author begins by discussing the indigenous understanding of time, which is deeply connected to the cycles of nature and the land. Indigenous cultures perceive time as cyclical, non-linear, and intertwined with their surroundings. The author highlights how indigenous knowledge and practices offer a different perspective on time, emphasizing the interconnectedness of all living beings.

The chapter also examines the works of philosophers such as Henri Bergson, who proposed the idea of duration and intuition as a way to grasp the fluidity and irreversibility of time. Bergson challenges the reductionist view of time as a fixed and measurable quantity and suggests that true understanding comes from experiencing time as a continuous flow.

Drawing upon examples from art, literature, and film, the author explores how different mediums can evoke a sense of time and challenge conventional perceptions. The documentary "Winged Migration" is used as an example, where the filmmakers attempt to capture the perspective of migratory birds, revealing a different perception of the world and its temporal dimensions.

The chapter also touches on the political implications of time and the power dynamics associated with the ability to define and control time. The author discusses the experiences of disabled individuals and their struggle for recognition and agency in a society that often diminishes their experiences as nonbeing and nonexperience.

Furthermore, the author examines the connection between experience and experiment, highlighting the importance of actively engaging with the environment and learning through direct interaction. By recognizing the agency of all beings and embracing co-creation, a new understanding of time emerges—one that is empowering and humbling.

The chapter concludes by urging readers to challenge the hierarchical and anthropocentric view of time, embracing a perspective that acknowledges the agency and interconnectedness of all beings. By putting time back in its place, individuals can develop a deeper appreciation for the richness and diversity of temporal experiences and foster a more inclusive and sustainable relationship with the world.


## A Change of Subject
"A Change of Subject" is a chapter that delves into the complex and interconnected issues surrounding the climate crisis, the moral dimension of environmental degradation, and the need for a shift in perspective and subjecthood. The chapter explores various themes and arguments to highlight the urgency and depth of the challenges we face.

The chapter begins by discussing the historical context of colonization and its relationship to the climate crisis. It draws parallels between the technocratic justifications for environmental exploitation in the past, such as the enslavement of people for economic gain, and the current arguments made by energy companies and investors. The author emphasizes the need to recognize the moral and social justice dimensions of climate change, rather than reducing it to merely an environmental or economic issue.

The concept of subjecthood is examined, with a focus on the Western Enlightenment idea of Man as the rational and political subject. The chapter challenges this notion and argues for a broader understanding that encompasses the agency and subjecthood of nonhuman entities. By acknowledging the subjecthood of the nonhuman world, the chapter contends that we can develop a more inclusive and ethical approach to addressing the climate crisis.

The importance of grief and collective action is also emphasized. The chapter suggests that grieving together and finding solace in shared experiences can be a powerful catalyst for change. It emphasizes the need for interconnectedness and mutual support to navigate the challenges ahead.

Furthermore, the chapter explores the notion of multiple worlds, past and future, and the need to reimagine our relationship with time. It encourages a shift in perspective that embraces the contingencies of the past and the possibilities of the future. By acknowledging the historical and ongoing losses and envisioning alternative futures, the chapter argues that we can find new ways of understanding and addressing the climate crisis.


## Uncommon Times
In the chapter titled "Uncommon Times," the author explores the concept of time and its relationship to power, language, and social structures. They delve into various perspectives on time and challenge the dominant capitalist notion that time is equivalent to money. The author argues that time can be understood and utilized in different ways, emphasizing the need to break away from a transactional understanding of time.

The chapter highlights the linguistic power dynamics at play, discussing how language can be used both as a tool of oppression and liberation. Advertisers and those in positions of power manipulate language to exert control and influence. However, the author also acknowledges language's potential for resistance and subversion, citing examples of marginalized communities reclaiming and redefining time-related expressions.

The author examines the significance of non-Western time designations, such as "Filipino time" and "Indian time," which challenge the rigidity of Western time constructs. These alternative temporalities offer different perspectives on punctuality and emphasize the importance of personal and collective experiences of time.

Furthermore, the chapter touches upon the role of routine and ritual in shaping our relationship with time. Routine can both restrict and compose life, and the author highlights the potential for rhythm and chronodiversity to offer alternative ways of experiencing time. They suggest that gardening time, rather than saving or hoarding it, could lead to a more harmonious and expansive understanding of temporal existence.

The chapter concludes by questioning the commodification of time and promoting the idea of time as a shared resource. The author suggests that by recognizing the interconnectedness of our temporal experiences and engaging in reciprocal acts of giving and receiving time, we can challenge the scarcity mindset and create a more abundant temporal reality.


## Life Extension
In the chapter titled "Life Extension," the author explores the concept of prolonging one's life and reflects on the limitations and implications of this desire. The chapter delves into various aspects of life extension, including the pursuit of longevity, the fear of death, and the interconnectedness of individuals within the larger social and natural world.

The author begins by discussing the cultural obsession with increasing one's numerical life span and the pathological nature of viewing life as a finite resource in a zero-sum game. They contrast this hoarding mentality with an alternative perspective of increasing life through mutual regard and connection, emphasizing the importance of acknowledging and valuing each other's existence.

The chapter highlights the ways in which social hierarchies, such as race, gender, ability, and class, contribute to the disregard and social death experienced by certain individuals. It explores the dynamics of inclusion and the need for a deeper understanding of personhood and community beyond market-driven values.

They emphasize the significance of regard and mutual recognition in bringing aliveness to both individuals and the world. The chapter explores the transformative power of connection and the potential for building a more vibrant and inclusive society.

Additionally, the chapter reflects on the inevitability of death and the traditional cultural responses to mortality. It explores how different cultures and religions approach death as a sacred reintegration into the world, emphasizing the continuity of life through the transmutation of energy and the interconnectedness of individuals beyond their physical existence.

The author concludes by contemplating the significance of embracing mortality and the fluidity of identity. They emphasize the importance of relinquishing the ego-driven desire for continuous expansion and instead finding meaning in the present moment and interconnectedness with the world. The chapter highlights the value of being fully alive through acts of perception, engagement, and gratitude.


## Halving Time
The chapter "Halving Time" explores the concept of time, the relationship between past and future, and the significance of moments that exist in between. The author reflects on the nature of time capsules, stating that every piece of writing serves as a capsule that assembles fragments of its own world and sends them to a reader in a different time and place.

The author recounts a personal experience of visiting Raab's Lagoon, a natural area near Quartermaster Harbor. They describe observing the tides and learning about their patterns and effects on the surrounding ecosystem. The author reflects on their newfound knowledge about tides and their fascination with the sea stars in the lagoon, particularly the threatened ochre sea star. The sea star's existence becomes a symbol of hope and a desire for a future where these creatures continue to exist.

The author delves into the concept of determinism and free will, referencing a story by Ted Chiang about a technology called the Predictor that undermines the belief in free will. Despite acknowledging the absence of choice, the narrator in the story urges others to behave as if their decisions matter, emphasizing the importance of belief and self-deception in avoiding a life devoid of motivation.

Drawing connections between sea stars and the broader ecosystem, the author highlights the significance of keystone species and their role in maintaining biodiversity. They discuss the evolutionary history of sea stars and their surprising connection to sea lilies. The sea star in front of the author becomes a representation of interconnectedness and the delicate balance of life.

As the tide continues to rise, the author experiences a sense of transformation and renewal within themselves. They contemplate the passing of time, both personally and collectively, and the recurring patterns and cycles that define our existence. The chapter concludes with a sense of ambiguity and a recognition that despite the impermanence of life, there is a continuous impulse for creation and renewal.
