# How to Significantly Improve Understanding of Mathematics Basics in Very Short Time
**Original Title**: How to significantly improve understanding of the basics of mathematics in a very short time
**Author**: Igor Kazarinov | **Year**: 2023 | **Category**: Science & Nature

## Summary
This book presents a practical guide for rapidly improving mathematical understanding by identifying and correcting fundamental knowledge gaps. Kazarinov introduces simple yet powerful exercises that address common pitfalls affecting nearly 90% of students—gaps that often go unnoticed by teachers, students, and parents alike.

The book is designed for parents seeking to improve their children's math knowledge, teachers wanting faster results with less effort, and students struggling with exam preparation. The core approach focuses on mastering mathematical terminology through game-like training sessions that make basic concepts as familiar as everyday words like "Coca-Cola."

## Core Insights

### The Foundation: Establishing Personal Motivation
Before any mathematical learning can occur, students must understand why they need mathematics and agree to invest time in studying it. Kazarinov emphasizes that forced learning without personal desire produces poor results and creates various physical and mental health problems. He defines mathematics simply as "a science which studies quantities and forms"—a definition accessible even to those who struggle with the subject.

> "Children in schools were taught almost the same way as trainers do with animals—children were put in classrooms and without asking students' desires they were told: 'Now we will study mathematics and then gramma!'"

**Quick Take**: Always secure student buy-in before beginning instruction. Without personal agreement and understanding of purpose, mathematical education becomes ineffective.

### The Game-Based Training Method
The cornerstone of Kazarinov's approach is game-like training where students repeatedly identify and name mathematical components until they achieve instant recognition and cheerful confidence. This method transforms abstract mathematical terminology into familiar vocabulary through positive reinforcement and rapid-fire practice.

> "Training should continue until the student will call the mathematical words quickly, correctly and cheerfully. If the student makes mistakes and need even a second to remember the word he still has not learned the words and there is no sense to move further."

**Quick Take**: Practice mathematical terminology until it becomes automatic and joyful, not just memorized.

### Addition and Subtraction Mastery
Students must master four key terms: addend, sum, minuend, subtrahend, and difference. Kazarinov discovered that many students cannot correctly identify these basic components even in simple equations like A + B = C or A - B = C.

The training involves:
- Writing sample equations
- Having students name each component instantly
- Mixing addition and subtraction examples randomly
- Continuing until responses become automatic and cheerful

> "I've heard such names as 'minus' and 'calculation'... After the student agrees that it is necessary to know exactly the correct names for all math actions I start to train him."

**Quick Take**: Ensure students can instantly identify and name all components of basic equations before progressing to more complex concepts.

### Multiplication and Division Precision
For multiplication (A × B = C), students must identify multiplier/factor and product. For division (A ÷ B = C), they need to know dividend, divider, and quotient. A critical emphasis is placed on understanding that division by zero is impossible—not just as a rule to memorize, but as a concept to fully grasp through verification attempts.

> "Mathematicians did not handle this intricacies... and simply FORBID dividing by zero. So you cannot divide by zero at all!"

**Quick Take**: Master the precise terminology of multiplication and division, with special attention to the concept and implications of division by zero.

### The Power of Positive Reinforcement
Kazarinov emphasizes that acknowledging correct answers is crucial for effective learning. He recommends using varied positive responses ("exactly," "good," "excellent") for correct answers and gentle phrases ("Oops") for incorrect ones. This approach prevents the frustration and anxiety commonly associated with mathematics education.

> "These confirmations (or 'acknowledgements') are VERY important parts of the training, which often are not done by teachers and parents."

**Quick Take**: Provide consistent positive feedback during mathematical training to maintain engagement and accelerate learning.

## Best Quotes
- "All exercises in this book are very powerful, quick and helpful. You need to do all practical exercises to very good results—this is the only way to help your student to understand basics of mathematics."
- "Very few people repeat these words when doing homework or chatting with friends. I explain that in order to memorize the word and to make it your own, it is necessary to USE it."
- "After my training things will go easier. All main difficulties stem from the very first misunderstood words."
- "Words are used when they are pronounced. That is why my students often tell more than I do during my lessons."
- "Many students at the next lesson with me told: 'Today I understood everything that our teacher was saying in school!'"

## Action Items
- **Secure Student Agreement**: Before any mathematical training, ensure students understand why they need mathematics and agree to invest time in learning it
- **Master Addition/Subtraction Terms**: Practice identifying addend, sum, minuend, subtrahend, and difference until recognition is instant and automatic
- **Master Multiplication/Division Terms**: Practice identifying multiplier/factor, product, dividend, divider, and quotient with the same level of automaticity
- **Use Game-Based Training**: Conduct all practice sessions in a cheerful, game-like format with abundant positive reinforcement
- **Verify Zero Division Understanding**: Ensure students truly understand why division by zero is impossible through practical verification attempts
- **Train All Operations Together**: Once individual operations are mastered, practice all four mathematical operations in random order until all terminology is equally familiar

## Questions to Consider
- Do you (or your student) truly understand why mathematics is relevant to daily life?
- Can you instantly name every component in the equation 7 + 3 = 10 and 15 - 8 = 7?
- Do you understand not just that you can't divide by zero, but why this limitation exists?
- How much anxiety versus joy do you associate with mathematical learning?
- Are mathematical terms as familiar to you as everyday words like "mother" or "Coca-Cola"?

## Conclusion
This book is worth your time if you're struggling with basic mathematics or teaching others who are. Kazarinov's approach is deceptively simple yet profoundly effective because it addresses the fundamental issue most mathematics education ignores: terminology mastery. His game-based training method, combined with positive reinforcement and emphasis on automatic recognition, can transform mathematical anxiety into confidence in remarkably short time—often just 15-20 minutes for older students.

The biggest reason to read this book is its focus on the actual root cause of mathematical difficulties: misunderstood basic terminology. By ensuring these foundations are solid, Kazarinov creates a pathway for genuine mathematical understanding rather than superficial memorization. While the exercises may seem elementary, their power lies in making mathematical language as natural as everyday speech, eliminating the translation barrier that prevents most students from grasping more advanced concepts.
