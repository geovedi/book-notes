# A Fever in the Heartland
Timothy Egan

***

"A Fever in the Heartland" by Timothy Egan is a gripping and meticulously researched historical account that delves into the rise and fall of the Ku Klux Klan's influence in the heart of America during the 1920s. Focused primarily on the state of Indiana, the book highlights the chilling impact of the Klan on society and politics, shedding light on the dark underbelly of a nation grappling with bigotry and hatred.

The book centers around the notorious case of D.C. Stephenson, the Grand Dragon of the Indiana Klan, whose charismatic leadership helped the organization gain immense power and influence. Stephenson's trial for the brutal murder of Madge Oberholtzer, a young woman he kidnapped and poisoned, became a turning point that led to the Klan's downfall. A jury of Hamilton County citizens convicted Stephenson, marking the beginning of the end for the Klan's grip on Indiana's state government.

Throughout the narrative, Egan introduces us to the brave individuals who fought against the Klan's oppression and bigotry. George Dale, a courageous newspaper editor, played a pivotal role in exposing the corruption and dangerous ideologies propagated by the Klan. Other notable figures, such as James Cameron, who miraculously survived a lynching attempt, dedicated their lives to speaking out against racial hatred and promoting civil rights.

The book also explores the broader historical context, examining the impact of the Klan's influence on immigration policies and racial discrimination. The Klan-sponsored Immigration Act of 1924 restricted the entry of Jews, Catholics, and various ethnicities, while African Americans faced segregation, disenfranchisement, and violence.

Despite the Klan's eventual decline, Egan warns against complacency, asserting that the ideas and hatred that fueled the Klan's rise still linger in society. He cautions readers that the struggle against prejudice and injustice continues to this day.

## The Quintessential Americans
In the chapter "The Quintessential Americans," the focus is on the pivotal role played by ordinary citizens in confronting and dismantling the powerful influence of the Ku Klux Klan in Indiana during the 1920s.

The chapter begins by highlighting the trial of D.C. Stephenson, the Grand Dragon of the Indiana Klan, for the murder of Madge Oberholtzer. The jury, composed of Hamilton County citizens, delivers a conviction that marks a turning point in the decline of the Klan's authority in the state. The bravery and determination of these twelve average individuals become emblematic of the fight against the Klan's influence.

Egan introduces Madge Oberholtzer as a heroic figure who played a significant role in exposing the true nature of the Klan. Her courageous actions while dying from poison and Stephenson's sadistic behavior revealed the darker aspects of the Klan's ideology. Without her testimony, the insidious influence of the Klan might have continued unchecked, possibly allowing Stephenson to reach even higher positions of power, including a run for the presidency.

The chapter explores the broader impact of the Klan's influence on society. Egan points out that many of Indiana's citizens took an oath to white supremacy and religious bias, leading to harassment and discrimination against various groups, including Jews, Catholics, and Black citizens.

The author emphasizes that the Klan was not the sole cause of these issues but rather a symptom of deep-rooted hatred and prejudice that existed in American society. He draws connections between the Klan's influence on immigration policies and racial discrimination and warns that remnants of these sentiments still persist, impacting American life a century later.

The chapter also sheds light on the role of prominent historical figures in the fight against the Klan's bigotry. Individuals such as James Cameron, who survived a lynching attempt and later founded chapters of the NAACP in Indiana, and George Dale, the courageous newspaper editor who exposed Klan corruption, serve as examples of those who actively opposed the Klan's reign of terror.



## An Empire of Hate

It then explores how the Klan experienced a resurgence in the 1920s, particularly in Indiana, where it wielded considerable influence over state politics and society.

Egan highlights the charismatic and cunning personality of D.C. Stephenson, the Grand Dragon of the Indiana Klan, who played a central role in the organization's growth and power.

The author details the Klan's impact on Indiana society, describing how it targeted and harassed various minority groups, including Jews, Catholics, African Americans, and immigrants. The Klan's ideologies were rooted in hatred and discrimination, leading to violent acts and injustices against these marginalized communities.

However, the chapter also sheds light on the ultimate downfall of the Klan in Indiana. Egan attributes its decline to several factors, including internal scandals and high-level hypocrisy that eroded public support. Additionally, the passage of time saw the fulfillment of many of the Klan's major goals, such as Prohibition and disenfranchisement of African Americans, leading to a decrease in its relevance.

The chapter concludes with reflections on the long-lasting impact of the Klan's legacy. Although the organization itself eventually dissolved, the ideas and sentiments it propagated continued to influence American society. Egan warns against seeing the Klan's decline as a definitive victory over prejudice, as echoes of its ideologies still persist and contribute to ongoing challenges in American life.


### An Opening in Indiana
In the chapter "An Opening in Indiana," the author delves into the case of D.C. Stephenson, the Grand Dragon of the Indiana Ku Klux Klan, and his notorious trial for the murder of Madge Oberholtzer in 1925.

The chapter begins by introducing the charismatic and manipulative personality of D.C. Stephenson, who was a key figure in the resurgence of the Ku Klux Klan in Indiana during the 1920s. Stephenson's ability to exploit public sentiment, coupled with the Klan's promotion of white supremacy and anti-immigrant sentiments, allowed the organization to gain considerable influence over the state's political and social landscape.

The focus then shifts to the events surrounding the murder of Madge Oberholtzer, a young woman who was drugged and assaulted by Stephenson. The case gained national attention and became a pivotal moment in the fight against the Klan's influence in Indiana.

It raises questions about what might have happened if Stephenson had not been convicted, potentially leading to even more dire consequences for the state and the nation.

Egan acknowledges the complexities of history and cautions against seeing the trial as a complete victory over prejudice.

The chapter delves into the relationship between the Klan and the Horse Thief Detective Association, a private militia with arrest powers. The association, despite repeated calls for its outlawing, remained a powerful force in Indiana long after the decline of the Klan. The group's activities were characterized by harassment of minority groups, especially African Americans and immigrants, and the enforcement of white supremacist ideologies.

Egan sheds light on the political climate of the time, where leaders of the 1920s Klan not only influenced public sentiment but also rode the wave of existing prejudices and hatred. The chapter explores how a vein of deep-rooted hatred was always present in American society, and the Klan managed to exploit and amplify it.

The author highlights some of the most significant consequences of the Klan's influence, including the Klan-sponsored Immigration Act of 1924, which severely restricted immigration from certain countries based on religious and racial biases. This act remained in effect for over four decades and had a lasting impact on the nation's demographics and immigrant communities.

Furthermore, the chapter discusses the state's implementation of compulsory sterilization laws and the denial of reproductive rights to thousands of individuals deemed undesirable by those in power. The United States Supreme Court's Buck v. Bell decision in 1927 upheld the right to sterilize individuals deemed "feeble-minded," setting a dangerous precedent for the forced sterilization of minorities, the disabled, and other marginalized groups.

Despite the eventual decline of the Klan's power, the chapter reveals that the legacies of its ideologies persisted. Racism, discrimination, and hatred continued to haunt American life, contributing to the nation's ongoing struggles with civil rights and social justice.

Egan highlights the courage and bravery of Madge Oberholtzer, who played a crucial role in exposing the true nature of the Klan and its leader. Her testimony and the details of the heinous crime committed against her helped to shake Indiana from the grip of the Klan. Without her actions, Stephenson might have risen to greater political heights, and the Klan's influence might have persisted for longer.

The author also delves into the charismatic and manipulative nature of Stephenson, describing him as "the most talented psychopath ever to tread the banks of the Wabash." Stephenson's ability to influence public sentiment and gain followers was instrumental in the Klan's rise to power.

Furthermore, the chapter explores the impact of the trial on the broader political landscape in Indiana.

Egan also emphasizes the broader historical context, discussing the Klan-sponsored Immigration Act of 1924, which restricted immigration based on religious and racial biases. This act remained in effect for over four decades and contributed to the climate of discrimination and prejudice in the country.


### Woman of the Year
In the chapter "Woman of the Year," the focus is on the life and legacy of Madge Oberholtzer, a key figure in the downfall of the Ku Klux Klan's influence in Indiana during the 1920s.

The author highlights the significance of Madge's testimony and actions, which served as a turning point in the trial. Without her willingness to speak out against Stephenson, the true extent of the Klan's corruption and violence may have remained hidden, allowing them to maintain their power and influence in Indiana.

Furthermore, the chapter explores the broader implications of Madge's sacrifice. Her courage and the subsequent trial and conviction of Stephenson brought about relief to the town of Noblesville and marked the end of the Klan's powerful influence in state government. It revealed the dangers of allowing a silken-voiced sexual predator to manipulate and control the political system.

Egan also emphasizes the significance of Madge Oberholtzer's legacy in shaping the history of Indiana and America. Her actions exposed the veiled hatred and prejudice that lay beneath the surface of society and contributed to the eventual disbandment of the Klan.

The chapter also discusses the Klan's role in advocating for Prohibition, disenfranchisement of African Americans, and discrimination against various religious and ethnic groups.

The author sheds light on the deeply troubling practice of forced sterilization that was enforced in Indiana until 1974. The state's eugenics law allowed authorities to deny thousands of Hoosiers the right to have children based on perceived genetic deficiencies. The law was upheld by the United States Supreme Court in the case of Buck v. Bell in 1927, setting a dangerous precedent for similar laws in other states and even inspiring Nazi Germany's eugenics policies.

Furthermore, Egan discusses the presence of private militias, such as the Horse Thief Detective Association, which operated in Indiana even after the decline of the Klan. These vigilante groups took the law into their own hands and used their powers to harass and intimidate minority communities.

Despite the dark and troubling aspects of Indiana's history, the chapter also highlights the resistance and resilience of individuals who fought against the Klan and bigotry. Figures like George Dale, an editor who courageously spoke out against the Klan's corruption, and Dr. Lucian Meriwether, who successfully challenged discriminatory practices, stood up against the prevailing hatred and prejudice.


### The Unmasking

Her tragic death became the catalyst for the decline of the Klan's once formidable grip on Indiana's state government.

Egan emphasizes the significance of the trial and its outcome. The conviction of Stephenson marked a turning point in Indiana's history, as it shattered the illusion of the Klan's invincibility and exposed the dark truth about the organization's leadership and methods.

The author also highlights the bravery and courage of Madge Oberholtzer, whose testimony from her deathbed played a critical role in shaking Indiana from the grip of the Klan. Her willingness to speak out against her attacker and expose the true nature of the political puppeteer behind the Klan's facade was crucial in unmasking the organization's corruption.

Moreover, the chapter delves into the broader impact of the trial. It showed that the Klan's influence was not insurmountable and that ordinary citizens had the power to hold the organization accountable for its crimes. With Stephenson's conviction, the fever of the Klan's power began to dissipate, leading to the eventual dissolution of the organization in Noblesville, Indiana, just a year after the trial.

Egan also presents a broader reflection on the consequences of the Klan's actions. The chapter suggests that while Stephenson was a charismatic con man, the Klan's ideology of hatred and discrimination had already taken root in Indiana. The organization may have fallen apart due to scandals and hypocrisy, but the vein of hatred it tapped into remained, impacting American life for many years to come.


### Creating D. C. Stephenson

Egan delves into Stephenson's early life and background, revealing a man with a dark past. He was a charismatic con man who had a history of criminal behavior even before he drifted north of the Ohio River to Indiana. The chapter sheds light on the impact of Stephenson's presence in Indiana, where he instigated an oath to white supremacy and religious bias, leading to harassment of Jews, Catholics, and African Americans, and denying basic rights and freedoms to Black citizens.

The author also highlights the role of Stephenson's trial and conviction in the ultimate unraveling of the Klan's influence. While Stephenson had positioned himself as a powerful figure and harbored ambitions of running for the United States Senate or even the White House, the trial exposed his true nature as a sexual predator and murderer, ultimately leading to his imprisonment.

The KKK gained thousands of members, cutting across class, gender, and age lines, including prominent figures in politics, law enforcement, and business.

Egan also highlights the role of the media, particularly newspapers, in either fueling or challenging the Klan's rise. Some papers, like the Indianapolis Times, bravely exposed the corruption and violence associated with the Klan, while others pandered to its agenda, further amplifying its influence.

Despite the Klan's claims of being a patriotic and benevolent organization, the chapter unveils its dark underbelly—marked by corruption, violence, and discrimination against African Americans, Jews, Catholics, and immigrants. The Klan's true nature eventually came to light, leading to its downfall.

Moreover, the chapter sheds light on the changing political landscape in Indiana as voters began to reject candidates associated with the Klan.

Stephenson's shrewd tactics and oratory skills allowed him to rally widespread support for the Klan's agenda, which aimed to uphold white supremacy, promote anti-immigrant sentiment, and impose religious bias.

Under Stephenson's leadership, the Klan rapidly expanded its membership and gained significant political influence.

This enabled the Klan to push its legislative agenda and enact policies that targeted minority groups, particularly African Americans, Jews, Catholics, and immigrants.

The chapter highlights the insidious nature of the Klan's activities, as it operated secretly, often using intimidation and violence to enforce its beliefs and maintain control. Klan members, often disguised in their iconic white robes and hoods, spread fear and terror among those who opposed their agenda.

The Klan's influence extended beyond Indiana, as it played a role in national politics and supported the 1924 presidential campaign of Hiram Evans, the Imperial Wizard.

Additionally, the chapter sheds light on the Klan's involvement in various community activities, such as organizing parades, fairs, and social events. The Klan presented itself as a patriotic and moral organization, using such events to garner public support and disguise its true intentions.

He leveraged economic anxieties, anti-immigrant sentiment, and anti-Catholic prejudices to garner support from a broad cross-section of Indiana's population.

As the Klan gained political power, it sought to influence the state's institutions and government. A significant number of elected officials, including the governor and numerous mayors, were Klan members, allowing the organization to pass legislation aligned with its discriminatory beliefs. The chapter also explores how the Klan used its influence to control law enforcement, leading to a climate of fear for anyone who dared to challenge the organization's authority.

One of the most significant events during this era was the trial of D.C. Stephenson, which took place in Hamilton County.

The trial marked a turning point in the decline of the Klan's influence in the state, as it exposed the true nature of the organization and its leader.

Despite the trial's outcome and Stephenson's imprisonment, the chapter argues that the hysteria that took hold of Indiana during the 1920s left a lasting impact on the state's history. The deep-rooted prejudices and hatred fostered by the Klan continued to affect communities and institutions long after the organization's decline.

Following Stephenson's conviction, the influence of the Klan in Indiana rapidly declined. The organization's political power eroded, and many of its members faced public scrutiny and condemnation. The chapter explores how the once-feared Klan was reduced to irrelevance in the state, leading to its eventual dissolution in Noblesville just a year after Stephenson's conviction.

Egan also reflects on the broader impact of the Klan's downfall in Indiana. While Stephenson's conviction was a significant moment in history, the chapter emphasizes that the deep-rooted prejudices and hatred that fueled the Klan's rise did not disappear entirely. Indiana's history of discrimination and racial tension persisted, and the consequences of the Klan's influence continued to shape the state's social fabric for decades to come.

The chapter concludes with the aftermath of Stephenson's release from prison and his subsequent attempts to rebuild his life.

The community members, regardless of their religious backgrounds, came together to form a human chain around the church, vowing to protect it from any harm. This powerful display of unity and solidarity sent a strong message to the Klan that the people of Irvington would not be intimidated or divided by their hateful ideology.

Through the vigil and other acts of resistance, the chapter portrays how the people of Irvington showed courage and determination in the face of the Klan's aggression. Their actions demonstrate that ordinary citizens can stand up against bigotry and discrimination, even in the most challenging and dangerous circumstances.


### The Witness
In the chapter "The Witness," the focus is on Madge Oberholtzer, a key figure in the downfall of the Ku Klux Klan's influence in Indiana during the 1920s. Madge was a courageous young woman who played a pivotal role in exposing the corruption and brutality of the Klan's leader, D.C. Stephenson.

Madge Oberholtzer was an employee of the Indiana state government and worked as a secretary for D.C. Stephenson, who held a powerful position in the state's politics and was the Grand Dragon of the Ku Klux Klan in Indiana. During her time working for Stephenson, Madge suffered from his sexual harassment and predatory behavior. This mistreatment reached a breaking point when Stephenson kidnapped and raped her.

Despite the traumatic experience, Madge had the courage to speak out and report the crime to the authorities. Her bravery and willingness to testify against Stephenson were pivotal in bringing him to justice. The trial that followed was a turning point in Indiana's history, as it led to the rapid decline of the Klan's influence in the state's government.

The chapter highlights how Madge Oberholtzer's testimony and her determination to seek justice became a symbol of resistance against the Klan's tyranny. It exposed the dark underbelly of the powerful organization, showing the public the true nature of the man who claimed to be the law and the puppeteer behind much of Indiana's political landscape.

Madge's testimony was a crucial factor in the conviction of D.C. Stephenson for murder. This verdict sent shockwaves through the Klan's ranks and contributed to the eventual collapse of the organization's influence in the state. Her bravery and sacrifice in speaking out against the Klan's leader helped to dismantle the image of invincibility that the Klan had cultivated.



## Reckoning
### Big Man in a Small Town
In the chapter "Big Man in a Small Town," the focus is on D.C. Stephenson, a charismatic and manipulative leader who rose to power as the Grand Dragon of the Ku Klux Klan in Indiana during the 1920s. Stephenson's ability to tap into existing veins of hatred and prejudice in the state allowed him to gain significant influence and control over politics, law enforcement, and public sentiment.

D.C. Stephenson was a skilled con man who knew how to exploit people's fears and prejudices for his own gain. He was able to rally large crowds, using his silver tongue to spread the Klan's message of white supremacy, religious bias, and nativism. Stephenson's rise to power coincided with a time of societal upheaval, where many Americans felt disillusioned and fearful of the rapidly changing world around them.

Stephenson's influence over Indiana's politics was far-reaching, with the Klan controlling key positions in government, including the governor's office. He used this power to push through laws that promoted the Klan's agenda, such as the Klan-sponsored Immigration Act of 1924, which restricted immigration based on ethnicity and nationality.

The chapter also explores how Stephenson's control over law enforcement allowed him to act with impunity, terrorizing minority communities and silencing opposition. His ability to manipulate the justice system ensured that he remained untouchable for a long time, despite his involvement in numerous criminal activities.

Stephenson's reign came to a dramatic end when he was convicted of the brutal murder of Madge Oberholtzer, a young woman who had worked as his secretary. Madge's courageous testimony and the ensuing trial exposed the dark underbelly of the Klan and revealed Stephenson's true nature as a sexual predator and murderer.


### One Nation under a Shroud
In the chapter "One Nation under a Shroud," the focus is on the decline of the Ku Klux Klan's influence in Indiana and its ultimate dissolution. Despite its decline, the chapter emphasizes that the ideas and attitudes promoted by the Klan during its peak continued to persist and shape American society.

The chapter delves into the aftermath of D.C. Stephenson's conviction for the murder of Madge Oberholtzer and how it marked a turning point in the decline of the Klan's power. Stephenson's trial exposed the dark and violent nature of the Klan, leading to a loss of public support and credibility. With his incarceration, the Klan's influence began to wane, and its membership declined significantly.

However, the chapter also warns against viewing the demise of the Klan as a complete victory over its ideology. While the organization itself may have dissolved, the ideas it promoted, such as white supremacy, religious bias, and anti-immigrant sentiment, remained deeply ingrained in society. The Klan's impact was not solely limited to its existence but had far-reaching consequences on shaping laws, policies, and public sentiment for years to come.

The chapter highlights the enduring legacy of the Klan's influence through various examples, such as the Klan-sponsored Immigration Act of 1924, which remained in effect for over four decades and restricted the immigration of certain ethnic and religious groups to the United States.

It also discusses the persistence of racial segregation and discrimination, such as the continued segregation of schools in Indianapolis until 1971, despite the decline of the Klan. Additionally, the chapter explores how Indiana had pioneered the world's first compulsory sterilization law and continued to enforce it until 1974, denying thousands of Hoosiers the ability to have children.

Moreover, the chapter reveals the lingering presence of private militias and vigilantism in Indiana, even after the decline of the Klan. It wasn't until 1933 that the state legislature finally put an end to these vigilante groups with arrest powers.

The chapter concludes with the realization that the Klan's fall was not a definitive end to the ideas and prejudices it promoted. Instead, these ideologies continued to shape American life, contributing to the racism, hatred, and intolerance that persisted in society for decades after the Klan's decline.

With Stephenson's conviction, the chapter highlights how the Klan's influence rapidly declined in Indiana.

The chapter emphasizes the significance of Madge's testimony in achieving justice. Her willingness to speak out against Stephenson, even as she lay dying from poison, resonated with the jury and the public, leading to Stephenson's conviction for her murder.

Madge Oberholtzer's contribution extended beyond the trial. The chapter highlights that her bravery served as a catalyst for putting an end to the Klan's influence in Indiana.

Stephenson as a charismatic and manipulative leader, referred to as the "Grand Dragon," who used his charm and persuasive skills to recruit followers and gain political power.

Moreover, the chapter introduces individuals who suffered at the hands of the Klan, including African Americans, Jews, Catholics, and immigrants, who were targeted with discrimination and violence. It emphasizes the courage of those who stood up to the Klan's reign of terror, such as Dr. Lucian Meriwether, an African American man who refused to back down in the face of racism and intimidation.

As the Klan's influence grew, so did the resistance against it. The chapter shows how public sentiment began to turn against the Klan, leading to electoral victories for those who campaigned against its corruption and hatred. This shift in public opinion eventually contributed to the decline of the Klan's power and influence in Indiana.


### He Said
In the chapter "He Said," the focus is on the trial and downfall of D.C. Stephenson, the Grand Dragon of the Ku Klux Klan in Indiana, for the murder of Madge Oberholtzer.

The chapter delves into the details of the trial that took place in Hamilton County, where a jury of ordinary citizens convicted Stephenson for the murder of Madge Oberholtzer. Madge's courageous testimony before her death played a pivotal role in exposing Stephenson's sadistic nature and the true nature of the Klan's influence in Indiana's government.

The trial marked a turning point in the decline of the Klan's power and influence in the state.

The chapter begins by highlighting the life of D.C. Stephenson after his release from prison. Despite trying to establish a new life with his daughter, Stephenson's predatory behavior resurfaced, leading to more legal troubles. He moved from place to place, attempting to evade his past, but eventually faced the consequences of his actions.

The story then shifts to other key figures involved in dismantling the Klan's influence. James Cameron, who survived a lynching attempt when he was sixteen, spent his life advocating against racial hatred. He founded several chapters of the NAACP and America's Black Holocaust Museum, working tirelessly to combat bigotry and prejudice.

Another important figure was James Weldon Johnson, who served as the secretary of the NAACP and played a crucial role in breaking the Black vote away from the Republican Party. He was a prolific writer and poet, contributing significantly to the African American literary and cultural landscape.

The chapter also acknowledges the contributions of Will Remy, the boy prosecutor who grew into an elder statesman. He played a pivotal role in bringing down corrupt officials with Klan ties and ensuring justice prevailed in the courts.

The Indianapolis Times, the newspaper that extensively covered the Klan's corruption, also receives recognition for its courageous reporting, which earned it a Pulitzer Prize for public service in 1928.

The prosecution presented evidence detailing Stephenson's sadistic actions and how they led to Madge's death. They portrayed him as a charismatic and dangerous individual who used his position of power to prey on vulnerable women.

On the other hand, Stephenson's defense attempted to discredit the victim and portray her death as a suicide unrelated to his actions. They questioned her character and tried to shift the blame away from Stephenson.

Throughout the trial, the jury heard harrowing testimonies, and the courtroom was filled with emotions. The defense attempted to evoke sympathy for Stephenson, but the prosecution focused on seeking justice for Madge Oberholtzer.

In the end, the jury of Hamilton County citizens delivered a verdict of guilty, finding D.C. Stephenson responsible for Madge's death. This landmark verdict marked the end of the Klan's influence in Indiana. Stephenson's conviction resulted in a rapid decline of the Klan's power and brought some measure of relief to the state.

The chapter also acknowledges the bravery of Madge Oberholtzer, whose courage and testimony played a crucial role in exposing the true nature of Stephenson and the Klan's influence on the state government.
