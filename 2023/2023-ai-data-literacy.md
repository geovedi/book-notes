# AI & Data Literacy: Empowering Citizens of Data Science

**Authors**: Bill Schmarzo | **Year**: 2023

## Summary
AI & Data Literacy presents a comprehensive framework for becoming a "Citizen of Data Science" in an increasingly AI-driven world. Schmarzo argues that AI and data literacy is no longer optional but essential for everyone, regardless of their technical background. The book demystifies AI concepts, explains how AI systems work, and provides practical guidance for participating in AI-related conversations and decisions.

The book is particularly valuable for non-technical professionals, business leaders, educators, and everyday citizens who want to understand and shape AI's impact on society. Readers will gain the knowledge and confidence to engage in AI discussions, make informed decisions about data usage, and contribute to the ethical development of AI systems.

## Core Insights

### The AI and Data Literacy Educational Framework
The book introduces a six-component framework designed to guide personal and organizational development in AI literacy. This framework serves as guard rails rather than railroad tracks, providing flexible guidance for becoming an effective Citizen of Data Science. The framework encompasses data privacy awareness, AI techniques, decision-making literacy, statistical understanding, value engineering competency, and AI ethics - all essential for navigating the AI-dominated landscape.

> "The AI and Data Literacy Framework provides those guard rails – and the associated guidance, rules, principles, and concepts – to ensure that everyone is aware of and educated on their role in ensuring the responsible and ethical definition, design, development, and management of AI models."

**Quick Take**: This framework transforms AI literacy from a technical challenge into an accessible, structured learning journey for everyone.

### Understanding AI Utility Functions
At the heart of every AI system lies the AI utility function - a mathematical expression that maps variables and metrics to guide decision-making. The book explains that AI systems are essentially "dumb" in that they relentlessly optimize whatever utility function humans define. This makes the careful design of these functions critical, as they determine whether AI delivers beneficial or harmful outcomes.

An AI model is defined as "a set of algorithms that seeks to optimize decisions and actions by mapping probabilistic outcomes to a utility value within a constantly changing environment…with minimal human intervention."

**Quick Take**: The key to ethical AI isn't in the algorithms themselves, but in how humans define what the AI should optimize for.

### Holistic Value Definition Beyond Financial Metrics
Schmarzo challenges organizations to expand their definition of value beyond traditional financial and operational metrics. A healthy AI utility function should include variables from multiple value dimensions: financial, operational, customer, employee, partner, societal, environmental, and even spiritual/ethical considerations. This broader perspective prevents AI systems from optimizing for narrow objectives at the expense of broader wellbeing.

> "An AI model will continuously seek to optimize its AI utility function as the AI model interacts with its operating environment. The AI model provides positive and negative feedback to the AI utility function so that the AI utility function can learn and adapt the weights of the variables and metrics that comprise the AI utility function to make the right decisions and actions."

**Quick Take**: Organizations that define value holistically create AI systems that benefit all stakeholders rather than optimizing for narrow financial gains.

### Decision-Making Literacy in the AI Age
The book emphasizes that human decision-making skills become more crucial, not less, in an AI-driven world. Schmarzo outlines common decision-making traps such as confirmation bias, overconfidence, and reliance on averages. He provides practical tools like decision matrices and the OODA loop (Observe-Orient-Decide-Act) to help readers make better decisions while avoiding these pitfalls.

Critical thinking is presented as "your most potent weapon in a world where half-truths, fake news, and outright lies can be presented as truth."

**Quick Take**: AI should augment human decision-making, not replace it - but only if we develop strong critical thinking skills first.

### Ethics as the Foundation of AI Development
Ethics isn't an add-on to AI development - it's the foundation. The book explores how to integrate ethical considerations directly into AI utility functions using economic concepts. This approach makes ethics measurable and actionable rather than abstract principles. Schmarzo argues that organizations must develop shared policies, metrics, and measurement practices to make AI more accurate, understandable, transparent, equitable, and safe.

> "Ethics refers to principles and values guiding our behavior in different contexts, such as personal relationships, work environments, and society. Ethics encompasses what society considers morally right and wrong and dictates that we act accordingly."

**Quick Take**: Ethical AI requires codifying ethics into measurable variables that can be integrated into AI utility functions.

### Cultural Empowerment and "Becoming More Human"
To thrive alongside AI, humans must become "more human" - focusing on creativity, empathy, critical thinking, and collaboration. The book advocates for cultural empowerment that ensures everyone has a voice in defining how AI should be used. This includes creating environments that encourage diverse perspectives, continuous learning, and the courage to question AI recommendations.

Schmarzo emphasizes that "we must become 'more human' to thrive alongside AI," highlighting the importance of uniquely human capabilities in an automated world.

**Quick Take**: The future belongs to those who can combine human strengths with AI capabilities rather than competing with AI on its terms.

## Best Quotes
- "AI will not take over your job. Someone who uses AI will take over your job."
- "If data is the new oil, then analytics is the exploration, mining, extraction, and production tools we use to convert raw oil into products of value."
- "Since AI systems are dumb systems that only seek to optimize around the variables, metrics, weights, and the outcome utility value defined in the AI utility function, defining the AI utility function holistically and comprehensively becomes critical."
- "Critical thinking is your most potent weapon in a world where half-truths, fake news, and outright lies can be presented as truth."
- "Economies of learning are more powerful than economies of scale in a digital-centric world."
- "To become a Citizen of Data Science, we need a set of guidelines – a framework – against which to guide our personal and organizational development with respect to understanding how to thrive in a world dominated by AI and data."

## Action Items
- Assess your current AI and data literacy using the book's radar chart framework across all six dimensions
