## A Science of Awe
### Eight Wonders of Life (An Awe Movement Begins)
In 1988, Paul Ekman introduced awe as a new emotion in psychology, challenging traditional views of emotions as disruptive to rationality. However, awe itself is difficult to define and measure. It is described as the feeling of being in the presence of something vast that transcends one's understanding of the world. The experience of awe can vary depending on cultural and personal context.

To better understand the patterns and essence of awe, the authors collected narratives of awe experiences from individuals in 26 countries. Through this research, awe was classified into eight wonders of life: moral beauty, collective effervescence, nature, music, visual design, spirituality and religion, life and death, and moments of epiphany. Common sources of awe included moral beauty and exceptional physical beauty, while collective effervescence brought people together in a collective self. Other sources of awe included nature, music, visual design, spirituality and religion, life and death, and moments of epiphany.

Awe is distinct from fear and is not rooted in materialism or consumerism. Previous studies on emotions tended to focus on fear, disgust, and joy, neglecting the exploration of awe. This study aimed to inspire awe in participants by using emotionally rich GIFs. Participants were asked to rate their experiences of awe, fear, horror, and beauty. The results placed awe near admiration, interest, and aesthetic appreciation, but far from fear and horror. Awe and beauty were also found to be distinct experiences, with awe being characterized by its vast and mysterious nature.

Interestingly, people experience awe quite frequently, with about 2-3 awe-inspiring moments occurring in their daily lives. Moral beauty, nature, and art/music/film were identified as common triggers of everyday awe. Cultural differences were found to influence the sources of awe experienced by individuals.

Awe is seen as part of a transcendent state that includes joy, ecstasy, fun, and gratitude. It holds the power to transform the mind, one's sense of self, and the way of being in the world, making it a profound and meaningful emotion in human experience.

### Awe Inside Out (How Awe Transforms Our Relation to the World)
In an exciting turn of events, Pete Docter contacts the author for his next film, "Inside Out," which delves into the emotions within a young girl's mind. The movie beautifully illustrates how emotions transform perception and drive actions, providing a perfect backdrop for the exploration of awe.

The author delves into the concept of awe, which he believes diminishes the self and connects individuals to something larger. Awe experiences can be expressed through various avenues such as art, spirituality, and even psychedelic encounters, often leading to the dissolution of the self. As individuals experience awe, the prominence of their default self is reduced, making room for a sense of connectedness and humility.

Research further supports the notion that awe leads to a "small self" and a profound understanding of interconnectedness with the world. It challenges the belief in complete agency, as people recognize the impact of external forces on their lives. In turn, awe fosters inner peace, humility, and a shift from a competitive to a collaborative mindset. The brain's default mode network is suppressed during awe experiences, reducing self-centeredness and anxiety.

Awe also ignites wonder, which, in turn, fosters curiosity, openness, and an acceptance of life's mysteries. The feelings of wonder and awe inspire "saintly tendencies" like sacrifice and generosity, expanding the circle of care and promoting empathy and kindness towards others.

In the context of the sequel to "Inside Out," the character of awe could play a transformative role in Riley's sense of self. It could inspire wonder and saintly behaviors, empowering her to give selflessly to others and fostering a deeper connection with the world around her.

The experiences of awe may even relate to feelings of spirituality, akin to the chimpanzee's "waterfall display," adding further layers of depth and meaning to the exploration of emotions in the film. Overall, the concept of awe is a powerful and compelling aspect to consider in the storytelling of "Inside Out" and its potential sequel, enriching the narrative with profound insights into human emotions and experiences.

### Evolution of the Soul (What Our Tears, Chills, and Whoas Tell Us About the Why of Awe)
The author contemplates experiences of awe and the emotional impact of losing a loved one. Awe is often triggered by music, nature, and shared memories, evoking tears and chills. This phenomenon has been explored by Charles Darwin and William James, who linked awe and related emotions to bodily responses.

Tears of emotion can arise from acts of communal sharing, signaling unity and connection with others. Chills, also known as ASMR, evoke sensations of intimacy, comfort, and a feeling of home, all rooted in bodily responses. A new science of embodiment reveals that bodily sensations underpin our conscious experience of emotions and perceptions, shedding light on the origins and meaning of awe.

Awe, tears, and chills are interconnected bodily responses that provide insights into the origins of awe experiences. The bodily expressions we exhibit, such as furrowed brows and tightened mouths in anger, can influence our perceptions and emotions. Chills and tears often accompany awe, epiphanies, and encounters with the Divine, reflecting a sense of connection with others.

Chills can be of two types: cold shivers associated with horror and dread, and goosebumps associated with a sense of joining with others in community. Awe-related sounds, like "whoas" and vocal bursts, serve as expressions of wonder and transcendence. Research indicates some universal and culturally specific expressions of awe across different countries. Vocal bursts of awe, such as "whoa" and "aaaah," are recognized across various cultures.

Awe's origins can be traced back to early hominids, where it facilitated social bonding and survival. Over time, awe has been archived in cultural forms, including literature, poetry, art, music, and rituals, creating shared aesthetic experiences. In indigenous cultures, awe was once an everyday emotion, but its expression evolved with the emergence of language and art.

Awe allows us to transcend ourselves, connect with others, and recognize larger patterns in nature, culture, and community. The emotions and bodily responses associated with awe provide profound insights into the human experience and the universal quest for connection and meaning.


## Stories of Transformative Awe
### Moral Beauty (How Others' Kindness, Courage, and Overcoming Inspire Awe)
San Quentin State Prison houses 4,500 prisoners, including those sentenced to execution in California. The author had the opportunity to visit the prison as part of an inmate-led restorative justice program and was deeply moved by the books on social injustice they encountered there. Despite their circumstances, the prisoners sought to surface their goodness through art and expression.

During the author's talk on awe, they worried that it might seem irrelevant to those with life sentences. However, to their surprise, the men in blue eagerly shared what evoked awe for them. The concept of awe is not limited to material wealth; in fact, people with fewer resources often report feeling more awe and wonder about their everyday surroundings.

The majority of the moral beauty that stirs awe comes from actions people take on behalf of others, such as acts of courage and kindness. The admiration for rare talents, like a trapeze artist's skills or a contortionist's abilities, also evokes awe. Awe often involves invoking the Divine to explain the sublime and transcending challenges and obstacles.

People from different countries and backgrounds experience awe in various ways. Witnessing rare talents, such as an autistic boy's ability to recall dates or a swimmer's world-record swim, can evoke awe. Everyday moral beauty, like acts of courage, kindness, and overcoming challenges, has the power to transform lives and inspire awe.

The impact of witnessing others' acts of moral beauty is profound; it activates regions of the brain associated with ethical action and releases oxytocin, promoting positive connections with others. Acts of reverence, such as gratitude and symbolic gestures, mark the wonders of life as sacred and evoke kindness in others, inspiring likeminded actions.

The practice of restorative justice, promoting nonviolence, recognition, and reconciliation, can have a transformative effect on individuals and communities. However, solitary confinement deprives individuals of experiencing everyday moral beauty, leading to severe consequences.

Embracing acts of reverence and moral beauty can create lasting connections and inspire positive change in the most challenging circumstances. The exploration of awe and moral beauty provides valuable insights into the human capacity for goodness, empathy, and transformation, even in the most unlikely places.

### Collective Effervescence (How Moving in Unison Stirs the Awe of Ritual, Sport, Dance, Religion, and Public Life)
Radha Agrawal's transformation at Burning Man led her to co-found Daybreaker, a dance party with the aim of recreating collective awe and fostering a sense of community. Moving in unison with others creates shared awareness and a profound sense of belonging to something larger than oneself. The natural inclination for collective movement is evident in the human waves of awe that arise at events and concerts.

Emotional contagion and shared attention enable a collective understanding and a transformed sense of self within a community. Cultural practices like funerals and graduations evoke awe and play a significant role in fostering a sense of shared identity among participants. Psychologist Belinda Campos, for instance, experienced awe at her graduation, representing the struggles of marginalized individuals achieving higher education.

Walking in unison is a simple form of collective movement with deep evolutionary roots, fostering awe and a sense of purpose. The concept of "awe walks," which involves seeking awe in nature or novel environments, has been found to increase feelings of awe and happiness over time. These awe walks lead to a decreased focus on the self and a greater awareness of being part of something larger than oneself. Regular contact with neighbors during walks also fosters a sense of community and an appreciation for everyday moral beauty.

Steve Kerr's philosophy of movement is rooted in his ancestors' moral beauty and the idea of uniting different individuals. In sports and games, collective effervescence is created, uniting communities through moving in unison. Similarly, dance in various cultures symbolizes experiences of being in the presence of the Divine and serves as a medium to express emotions like awe. Dance fosters interconnectedness and imagination, leading to collective effervescence and spiritual experiences within a community.


### Wild Awe (How Nature Becomes Spiritual and Heals Bodies and Minds)
Awe has the potential to reduce inflammation produced by chronic threats, rejection, and loneliness, serving as an antithesis to social threats that elevate proinflammatory cytokines. Everyday experiences of awe are associated with lower inflammation, which could play a role in preventing related diseases. The transformative power of awe is evident in the story of Stacy Bare, a Gulf War veteran who experienced awe amidst the horrors of combat.

The romantic era inspired a search for awe in nature and a deep connection with the sublime. Ralph Waldo Emerson, for instance, experienced awe at the Jardin des Plantes, recognizing the interconnectedness of all living systems. This biophilia, the love of life and living systems, encompasses our passions for nature. Experiencing awe in nature, whether by viewing landscapes or immersing in scents, signals a sense of resource abundance and safety.

Encouraging children's awe-filled exploration of nature is crucial for their understanding of life systems. Being in nature leads to awe-related vagus nerve activation, reducing stress responses and inflammation, ultimately improving concentration, well-being, and overall health. Stacy Bare dedicated his life to sharing the gift of wild awe with veterans and others, recognizing the profound mind-body benefits it brings.

Awe in nature has the power to put life's challenges in perspective and promote a sense of purpose and possibility. Moreover, it can counteract mean egotism and reduce narcissistic tendencies. Experiences of wild awe also lead to a greater awareness of gaps in knowledge and stimulate more rigorous thinking. Awe can even defuse political polarization by reducing the perception of vast gaps between opposing views.

Many people sense the Divine in nature and experience spiritual connections outdoors. Traditional ecological knowledge (TEK) teaches interconnectedness and reverence for the natural world, inspiring eco-friendly behavior and offering solutions to environmental crises. Iconic places like the Alps and Mont Blanc provide a breathtaking backdrop for profound experiences of awe and connection with nature.

## Cultural Archives of Awe
### Musical Awe (How Musical Awe Embraces Us in Community)
Yumi Kendall finds awe in the world through musical forms, experiencing the sounds around her in profound ways. One powerful expression of awe is found in lullabies, which create a somnolent awe in infants, fostering a sense of belonging and connection. Music serves as a symbolic medium of awe, allowing us to express and understand the mysteries of life. It stirs awe by opening our bodies to its neurophysiological profile, leading to chills and emotional responses. Music has the capacity to open our minds to the sublime, bringing moments of clarity, truth, and a deeper understanding of life.

Throughout history, music has been a social activity, providing a shared identity and connection with our past. Playing music with others can create awe and a sense of humbling connectedness to the present and future. Music has the unique ability to transport us through time and space, evoking powerful emotions and taking us on transformative journeys. The neurochemical signals in our brains give music personal and cultural meaning, shaping our experiences of awe.

When we listen to music that moves us, it activates the brain's dopaminergic circuitry, leading to wonder and exploration. Musical awe often involves tearing up and getting chills, merging us with others to confront mysteries and the unknown. Interestingly, when people listen to the same music together, their brains synchronize, creating a sense of unity and shared experience.

Susanne Langer's theory suggests that music represents our experience of life patterns in a realm of symbolic meaning. Klaus Scherer's research shows that music expresses emotions through acoustics that resemble vocal expressions of emotions. Music's acoustics trigger mimetic tendencies and shift our bodies and minds to the wonder of awe. Sacred music, in particular, shares acoustic features of vocalizations of awe, moving us toward feelings of awe and spiritual connection.

Music is deeply ingrained in many cultures, used in rituals and ceremonies to connect with the Divine and experience awe. While music has universal aspects, each culture develops its own unique musical expressions of life patterns. Music has the power to move us to synchronize our movements, fostering compassion and connection with others.

Artists like Diana Gameros and John Adams use music to reflect on social and political issues, evoking awe in their cultural roots or exploring the struggle between power and resistance, culminating in peace. Music has a unique ability to evoke strong emotions and a sense of connection with others, even in unfamiliar settings, making it a profound and universal source of awe.

### Sacred Geometries (How Our Awe for Visual Design Helps Us Understand the Wonders and Horrors of Life)
Jurassic Park is a celebration of the wonders of life, taking us on a journey of encountering overpowering nature, big ideas, and awe-inspiring dinosaurs. Visual art, exemplified by the CGI in Jurassic Park, has the power to evoke awe and pure delight in what is excellent. Michael, a Pixar set artist, finds awe in the world of computer animation, where he creates captivating visual worlds for Pixar films. Visual art has the ability to move us and evoke awe through neurochemical signals in the brain, activating emotions and bodily responses.

Works of art like De Hooch's paintings can evoke everyday awe and feelings of unity and connection with others. On a microscopic level, Rose-Lynn Fisher's photography reveals sacred geometries and patterns in nature, provoking a sense of awe at the intricacies of life. Visual art also allows us to grasp big ideas related to awe, such as expansion, infinity, and the unifying geometries of life. Fisher's photographs of tears of emotion demonstrate distinct neurochemical profiles and sacred geometries, further revealing the power of visual art to capture life patterns and sacred structures of the natural world.

Art has the ability to evoke awe by hinting at vast mysteries, expansive causal forces, and subverting default expectations. It enables direct perception of emotions, leading to insights and new possibilities of feeling. In Mesoamerican art, we see how mystical awe was cultivated through shamanism and interdependence with nature. Art activates the dopamine network in the brain, promoting creativity, inspiration, and pro-social behavior.

The role of visual design in fostering everyday awe is significant, as it positively impacts collective health and well-being. Hanging paintings in hospitals, for example, leads to patients feeling more secure and socializing more. Cities with awe-inspiring designs are associated with better health outcomes, even after accounting for income and pollution. Urban designs that foster a sense of orientation and community contribute to greater well-being.

Awe-based visual design locates individuals within larger life patterns of interdependence, encouraging a deeper connection to the world around us. Art has the capacity to evoke both awe and horror, prompting contemplation of social change. Political art from Central America and Mexican American artists documents and awakens us to moral harm, calling for action and awareness.

The impact of cultural forms on perception and transformation is significant, with more surprising and awe-inspiring art leaving a deeper impression. Visual art has played a crucial role in human evolution, promoting cultural intelligence and understanding of life's mysteries. By allowing direct experiences of awe, visual art benefits individuals and contributes to collective progress. Steven Spielberg's childhood experiences of awe have heavily influenced his career in film, demonstrating the profound impact of awe on artistic expression and storytelling.

### The Fundamental It (How Spiritual Life Grows Out of Awe)
Jennifer Bailey, also known as Reverend Jen, experienced racism at a young age but found solace and awe in an African Methodist Episcopal Church. She now leads the organization Faith Matters Network, which aims to make Christianity more inclusive and diverse. Rising religiously unaffiliated individuals still experience deep spirituality, believing in a Divine force animating their lives and a persistent soul.

Bailey finds mystical awe in the strength and courage of African American women, being inspired by their faith, storytelling, and sense of community. Similarly, Malcolm Clemens Young, dean of Grace Cathedral, experienced awe in natural beauty and has centered his career around exploring mystical awe. William James sought mystical experiences through various means, including spiritualism and nitrous oxide, and collected stories of encounters with the Divine.

Mystical awe originates in inexplicable experiences that transcend the expectations of the default self, and many people report having such encounters. These mysterious experiences often lead to the development of spiritual beliefs and explanations, and they take different forms across cultures. Extraordinary experiences are transformed into beliefs and stories about the Divine, shaping religious and spiritual traditions.

Mystical awe leads to a dissolution of the default self and activates brain regions associated with joy and bliss. It is heavily influenced by culture, history, place, and the prevailing ideas of the times. Various representations, rituals, and practices grow from these experiences of awe, shaping religious and spiritual practices.

Collective experiences of awe strengthen communities and lead to increased well-being and pro-social behavior. However, toxicities within communities of mystical awe can lead to tribalism and oppressive behavior. Individuals like Reverend Jen Bailey, Malcolm Clemens Young, and Yuria Celidwen are working to foster beliefs and practices that unite rather than divide, composting religious practices for a more inclusive and harmonious approach.

The transformative impact of experiences with psychedelics is exemplified in the case of Bob Jesse. Psychedelic experiences often lead to mystical awe and profound transformation. Studies explore the connection between psychedelics and mystical experiences, examining the role of openness to experience.

Psychedelics are being researched for their potential use as treatments for mental health issues and addiction, showing promise in therapeutic contexts. Awe walks, such as the one taken by Nipun and Guri Mehta in India inspired by Gandhi's salt march, have profound effects on individuals like Trupti Pandya during her 1,600-mile walk along the Narmada River.

The Gandhi 3.0 retreat focuses on awe-based experiences and rituals, emphasizing the power of awe in shaping personal and collective transformation. Overall, awe experiences, whether spiritual, psychedelic, or through collective rituals, have significant impacts on individuals' lives and communities, and they continue to be a source of inspiration and growth.

## Living a Life of Awe
### Life and Death (How Awe Helps Us Understand the Cycle of Life and Death)
Awe experiences related to the beginning and end of life are common across cultures. Human evolution has led to the unique vulnerability and dependency of human infants, making childbirth an awe-inspiring event. Witnessing the birth of a child and seeing the beauty of a newborn can evoke profound awe in parents and caregivers. Awe experiences during childbirth are not only emotionally significant but also have neurophysiological implications for parent-child bonding.

The narratives surrounding childbirth often center on the gift, beauty, and responsibilities of a new life. The nesting instinct and cultural archives of awe in child-rearing further contribute to the sense of wonder and awe surrounding the early stages of life. Even in grandparenthood, there are opportunities for awe experiences and the role of grandparents in childcare can be filled with wonder and joy.

Nancy Bardacke's work in promoting awe-filled births highlights the wonders of childbirth and its potential to be a transformative and awe-inspiring experience. Childhood experiences of awe have been linked to benefits for imagination and academic performance, making awe an important aspect of a child's development.

However, there are alarming trends of disappearing awe in children's lives, which can have negative impacts on their mental health. Rachel Carson, a prominent environmental advocate, recognized the importance of awe and wonder in children's lives. Her essay "Help Your Child to Wonder" promotes an awe-based approach to raising children, encouraging parents to embrace wonder and awe in simple acts of looking and listening to the natural world.

Carson emphasizes the need to avoid labeling and classifying natural phenomena, but rather to focus on the mysteries and interconnected systems of the natural world. This perspective encourages a deeper appreciation for the wonders of nature and fosters a sense of awe in children.

As life progresses, embracing the wonders of watching others die, as taught by Roshi Joan Halifax, can also be a source of awe and reflection. By practicing compassionate action and being open to both suffering and kindness, individuals can experience awe even in the face of loss and grief.

The exploration of near-death experiences (NDEs) further reveals the transcendental nature of awe. These experiences can connect individuals with loved ones even after death, providing a sense of comfort and wonder in the face of mortality.

### Epiphany (The Big Idea of Awe: We Are Part of Systems Larger Than the Self)
Charles Darwin's emotions and experiences of awe played a significant role in shaping his big ideas about evolution and emotions. His interactions with people and his travels on the Beagle greatly influenced his thinking about empathy and adaptation. While Darwin discusses various emotions in his writings, he never explicitly uses the term "awe" to describe his experiences.

However, Frank Sulloway, a Darwin scholar, believes that Darwin did indeed experience awe, and he points to various instances in Darwin's life and writings as evidence. For Darwin, his epiphany about evolution and the interconnectedness of life can be seen as a story of awe. Awe, in this context, leads to the knowing of fundamental truths and understanding our connection to something larger than ourselves.

The English language lacks precise vocabulary to describe the sense of connectedness experienced in awe. As a result, awe is often described using abstraction, metaphor, neologism, or mystical language. It connects us to a larger system that is initially invisible but becomes visible in the experience of awe.

Systems thinking is at the heart of awe, allowing us to perceive the interconnectedness of life and its deep structures. Systems, as entities of interrelated elements working together to achieve some purpose, become apparent when experiencing awe. It shifts our minds from a reductionistic view to a systems view of life, enabling us to perceive interdependence and interconnectedness.

Experiencing awe also leads us to understand that we are part of complex social networks, ecosystems, and systems of interdependent adaptations. Awe triggers neurochemical responses, and our cultural systems, such as art, music, and spirituality, help us convey and share our awe experiences.

The end purpose of awe is to integrate us into the systems of life, connecting our individual selves with the vast forces of existence. Awe is an emotion that enables us to wonder together about the mysteries and wonders of life, fostering a deeper understanding of our place in the interconnected web of existence.
