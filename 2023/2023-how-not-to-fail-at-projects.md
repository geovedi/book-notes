# How Not to Fail at Projects
**Authors**: Claude H. Maley | **Year**: 2023

## Summary
This satirical yet insightful guide exposes the "insanity spiral" that causes most projects to fail while offering practical solutions through seven "Sanity Checks." Maley, a veteran project manager with experience across 80+ countries and 110+ nationalities, uses humor and real-world anecdotes to reveal how organizations repeatedly make the same mistakes while expecting different results.

The book targets frustrated project managers, executives who commission projects, and anyone who has experienced the chaos of failed initiatives. Readers will gain a framework for breaking the cycle of project failure and learn to treat project management as a true profession rather than a casual assignment.

## Core Insights

### 🎯 The Seven Sanity Checks Framework
The book's centerpiece is a systematic approach to preventing project failure through seven critical checkpoints that must be addressed before and during any project initiative.

The first sanity check focuses on **how and when to appoint a project manager** - emphasizing that assigning unqualified individuals constitutes "professional homicide." Maley shares his own experience of being thrown into project leadership completely unprepared at IBM, a story that will resonate with many accidental project managers.

> "Repeating the same thing and expecting a different result is insanity. However, in my many professional years I have bordered on insanity, and I note that many individuals in the position of Project Manager travel on that same path."

**Quick Take**: Never assign project management responsibilities without proper training and experience. Organizations must recognize project management as a professional discipline requiring specific skills and preparation.

### 🔄 Projects as Instruments of Change
The second sanity check reveals that projects fail because organizations don't comprehend **why a project is truly needed**. Most organizations approach change reactively rather than proactively, drawing up plans without understanding that they operate in environments beyond their control.

Maley explains that projects often fail before they even begin due to fundamental misunderstandings about their purpose and lack of portfolio management systems. Organizations typically launch too many concurrent projects without assessing resource capacity or total funding requirements.

> "Projects are doomed to fail even before they are launched."

**Quick Take**: Implement coordinated project portfolio management at both strategic and operational levels. Launch the right project for the right reason, and maintain agility to change in an environment of constant change.

### 🎲 Embracing the Unknown
The third sanity check addresses **understanding the unknown** and challenges "the insanity of fixed plans." Maley argues that plans are made to be changed because they're based on incomplete information, assumptions, and speculative risk assessments.

Instead of creating rigid plans that inevitably break, project managers should identify Unknowns and transform them into "Known/Unknowns" - items that can be anticipated and planned for as future change requests. This approach prepares teams for inevitable modifications rather than pretending they won't occur.

> "If you fail to plan, you plan to fail."

**Quick Take**: Create flexible plans that anticipate change. Maintain a living list of identified Unknowns that will likely require future decisions and adjustments.

### 👥 Stakeholder Management and Decision Rights
The fourth sanity check focuses on **capturing who needs what** from the project. This involves understanding stakeholder needs, clarifying decision rights, and navigating the complex layers of management involved in project approvals.

Maley emphasizes that stakeholders may not be the sole decision-makers for their areas of responsibility, as higher-level management and cross-functional processes often create overlapping authority structures. Successful projects require robust stakeholder management processes that cast wide nets across the organization.

**Quick Take**: Map all stakeholders and decision-makers before project initiation. Establish clear processes for escalating decisions when they exceed project manager authority.

### 🔍 The Human Resources Challenge
The fifth sanity check addresses **who does what** - the critical challenge of securing and managing human resources in matrix organizations. Maley describes the "hunt" for project resources and the difficulties of getting competent people assigned to project work.

The core problem is that functional managers control personnel assignments, and project managers often fail to verify whether assigned resources have the actual competence, skills, and availability needed for their roles. This leads to delays and compromised project quality.

**Quick Take**: Verify resource competence and availability before accepting assignments. Develop strong relationships with functional managers to secure the right people for project work.

## Conclusion
This book is worth your time if you're tired of watching projects fail despite everyone's best efforts. Maley's satirical approach makes the painful truth about project failure more palatable while providing concrete, actionable solutions.

If you implement even a few of these insights, you'll significantly improve your project success rate and reduce the "insanity spiral" that plagues so many organizations.
