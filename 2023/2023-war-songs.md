## Core Insights

### The Rise of the "Wild Bunch"
The book introduces us to three very different men who would shape Milan's criminal landscape. Francis Turatello, born in 1944 to a single mother with rumored Mafia connections, rose from petty theft as a teenager to become the self-proclaimed "King of Milan." Renato Vallanzasca, the charismatic "beautiful René," was a master bank robber with an anarchic spirit who loved the spotlight. Angelo Epaminonda, known as "il Tebano" for his fierce loyalty and warrior spirit, was the most ruthless of the three. Their paths crossed in Milan's underworld, where they first fought each other, then formed uneasy alliances, and ultimately returned to war.

> "I liked banks with revolving doors - one kick and the world started spinning. I'd go out first, empty an entire magazine, and kick off the Wild West. They called us 'the wild bunch.'"
> _Original: "A me piacevano le banche con la porta girevole, un calcio e il mondo cominciava a girare. Uscivo per primo, facevo fuori un caricatore intero e davo il via al Far West. Ci chiamavano 'il mucchio selvaggio'."_

**Quick Take**: The three men represented different approaches to criminality - Turatello the empire-builder, Vallanzasca the showman, and Epaminonda the warrior. Their conflicting personalities made their alliance unstable and their eventual war inevitable.

### A Different Era of Crime
The book vividly portrays 1970s Milan as a city consumed by violence, where shell casings littered the streets and nightclubs brought together criminals, businessmen, and entertainment figures. In this era, kidnapping was rampant (543 people abducted between 1972-1985), and Milan averaged 150 murders annually. The criminals operated by their own code of honor, refusing to target civilians and maintaining rules that distinguished them from common thugs.

> "For a moment I thought I was dead, but when I heard all that noise I realized it was the cops. Only cops make that much noise. If it had been the guys, I wouldn't have heard a sound - I'd just be dead."
> _Original: "Per un attimo credetti di essere morto, ma quando sentii quel casino capii che erano gli sbirri. Solo gli sbirri fanno tanta cagnara. Se fossero stati i ragazzi non avrei sentito un fiato: sarei morto e basta."_

**Quick Take**: The book captures a vanished era when criminals operated under strict codes and public sentiment was sometimes sympathetic to charismatic bandits who seemed to challenge the establishment.

### The Bloody War for Control
The heart of the narrative follows the escalating conflict between Turatello and his former lieutenant Epaminonda, who turns against his boss in a bid for power. Their war becomes the most brutal criminal conflict Northern Italy had ever seen, with both sides using increasingly violent tactics. Vallanzasca navigates this conflict carefully, sometimes aligning with Turatello, sometimes with Epaminonda, but always maintaining his independence. The violence culminates in Turatello's brutal prison murder in 1981, where he's stabbed 47 times by four inmates, including the notorious "animal" Pasquale Barra, who allegedly bit out his intestines.

**Quick Take**: The criminal underworld operated like feudal kingdoms, where loyalty was conditional, betrayals were common, and the price of power was paid in blood.

### The Last Man Standing
The final chapters trace what became of the surviving players. Epaminonda died in 2016 after spending years in witness protection, never truly repentant for his crimes. Vallanzasca, now in his 70s, remains imprisoned after 46 years behind bars (reportedly a record in Italian justice). He occasionally speaks to journalists, maintaining that he was never a "pentito" (repented criminal) and that today's criminals lack the honor codes of his generation. The book ends with Vallanzasca as the last of the Mohicans, aging in prison while the world he once ruled has completely disappeared.

> "Many things I did, I wouldn't do again, but I'm not a pentitent. That word doesn't suit me—it was used for those who just decided to betray for their own interests."
> _Original: "Molte cose che ho fatto non le rifarei, ma non sono un pentito, quella parola non mi piace, è stata usata per chi aveva solo deciso di tradire per i propri interessi."_

**Quick Take**: Time eventually defeats all criminals, whether through violence, betrayal, imprisonment, or the simple erosion of the world they once dominated.

## Best Quotes

- "Milan in the 1970s was dark, gloomy, and unrecognizable compared to today. On the streets, you trod on pistol casings, the average murder rate was 150 per year, in nightclubs criminals, entrepreneurs, and show business people mixed, and gambling dens were hidden in unsuspecting palaces."
  _Original: "È questa la Milano degli anni Settanta. Oscura, plumbea, e irriconoscibile rispetto a quella di oggi. Per le strade si calpestano i bossoli di pistola, la media di omicidi è di 150 all'anno, nei locali notturni si mescolano delinquenti, imprenditori e personaggi dello spettacolo e le bische sono nascoste dentro a palazzi insospettabili."_

- "Born without possessing anything, they were ready to take everything, first shooting at each other, then allying, then shooting again."

War Songs is a masterful work of true crime that reads like a novel while maintaining rigorous historical accuracy. Nazzi's intensive research brings to life a vanished era of Italian criminality, showing how three very different men rose to dominate Milan's underworld and ultimately destroyed each other in their quest for power.

The book's greatest strength is its ability to humanize its subjects without glorifying them. We understand how these men became who they were, from Turatello's childhood candy shop robbery to Vallanzasca's circus antics and Epaminonda's warrior mentality. At the same time, Nazzi doesn't shy away from the brutality of their actions or the suffering they caused.

This is definitely worth your time if you're interested in true crime, Italian history, or stories of power and its consequences. The biggest reason to read it is the window it provides into a fascinating period when charismatic criminals challenged social norms and operated by their own codes - a world that has completely vanished but continues to capture our imagination. The book serves as both compelling entertainment and a sobering reminder of how quickly power can turn to violence and how crime ultimately doesn't pay.
