## Summary
Slow Seasons is a heartfelt exploration of living in harmony with nature's cycles through the ancient Celtic Wheel of the Year. Steer weaves together personal memoir, Scottish folklore, seasonal recipes, and practical crafts to demonstrate how aligning our lives with the rhythm of the seasons can provide solace in our fast-paced modern world. The book is structured around eight Celtic festivals—Imbolc, Ostara, Beltane, Litha, Lùnastal, Mabon, Samhain, and Yule—each marking pivotal points in the natural calendar.

Drawing from her Scottish heritage and personal journey with mental health, Steer shares how seasonal awareness helped her navigate OCD and depression. She presents the Celtic Wheel not just as ancient tradition but as a living practice that offers balance: acknowledging both light and darkness, growth and rest, activity and stillness. The book serves as both a practical guide and philosophical meditation on finding peace through nature's predictable cycles when life feels uncertain.

This gentle guide appeals to anyone feeling overwhelmed by modern life's relentless pace, seekers of slower living, craft enthusiasts, and those interested in Celtic traditions. Readers will discover how seasonal awareness can transform daily routines into meaningful rituals, provide natural anchors for mental wellbeing, and connect us to something larger than ourselves.

## Core Insights

### The Celtic Wheel as Mental Health Framework
The eight festivals of the Celtic Wheel provide a natural structure for emotional regulation and mindfulness. Steer shares how these ancient markers helped her through severe OCD and depression by offering predictable points of focus throughout the year. Each festival brings its own emotional resonance—Imbolc's hope during winter's darkest days, Beltane's celebration of life and growth, Samhain's embrace of darkness and rest. This cyclical understanding teaches us that difficult periods, like seasons, are temporary and part of natural balance.

> "The childish joy of the year's first snowfall. Spotting the first shoots emerge from the earth, a miracle of returning life and energy. The hazy freedom of endless Summer days at the seaside."

**Quick Take**: Use seasonal changes as natural prompts for mental check-ins and intentional self-care practices.

### Making as Meditation
The book emphasizes how traditional crafts and seasonal making serve as therapeutic practices, quieting anxious minds through focused hand-work. From cherry blossom syrup in spring to preserving autumn harvest, these activities connect us to ancestral wisdom while providing present-moment mindfulness. Steer shares family recipes and craft projects passed down through generations of Scottish women, demonstrating how creative expression has long served as emotional regulation.

> "Many of these projects I learnt at Mum's kitchen table over Scotch pancakes and jam. Now I make them at my own second-hand kitchen table that has seen everything from candle making to lockdown learning."

**Quick Take**: Choose one seasonal craft or recipe to practice each month as a form of active meditation.

### Darkness as Sacred Space
Rather than viewing winter and darker seasons negatively, Steer reframes them as essential periods of rest and reflection. Drawing from Celtic understanding of the dual goddess (Bride in summer, Cailleach in winter), she shows how embracing darkness allows for necessary restoration. This perspective offers profound relief from modern culture's pressure for constant productivity and positivity.

> "Whether you're in the countryside or the city, so much daily magic can be found – you just have to stop, slow down, and look around."

**Quick Take**: Plan specific rest activities for winter months, treating dormancy as productive preparation rather than wasted time.
