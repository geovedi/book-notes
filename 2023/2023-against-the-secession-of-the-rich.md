# Against the Secession of the Rich
**Original Title**: Contro la secessione dei ricchi
**Author**: Gianfranco Viesti | **Year**: 2023

## Summary

"Against the Secession of the Rich" is a critical analysis of Italy's regional autonomy movement and its potential to fragment the country. The book examines how requests for "differentiated autonomy" by wealthier northern regions like Veneto, Lombardy, and Emilia-Romagna could lead to a de facto secession of rich regions from the rest of Italy. Viesti, a renowned economist, argues that this process would create "region-states" within Italy, fundamentally transforming the country's unity and potentially exacerbating territorial inequalities. The author combines constitutional analysis, economic reasoning, and comparative international examples to demonstrate why Italy needs comprehensive reform of its decentralization systems rather than further asymmetrical devolution of power.

This book is essential for readers interested in Italian politics, constitutional law, fiscal federalism, and European regional integration. It offers valuable insights into how decentralization can either strengthen or weaken national unity, with lessons applicable beyond Italy's borders.

## Core Insights

### The "Secession of the Rich" Phenomenon

The book introduces the concept of "secession of the rich" to describe how wealthy regions seeking greater autonomy effectively separate themselves from the rest of the country without formally declaring independence. These regions would become "region-states" with extensive powers over education, healthcare, infrastructure, and environmental policy, while the central government would be left with residual powers over fragmented territories. The secession is "of the rich" both geographically (initiated by Italy's wealthiest regions) and economically (driven by desires to retain more tax revenue locally). This creates what Viesti calls a "Harlequin country" - confused, inefficient, and fundamentally unequal.

> "The 'secession of the rich' is defined in this book as the process that would begin with granting regions the new competencies as requested. The word 'secession' is used to evoke a separation that, although not legal, would be de facto."
> _Original: "Con 'secessione dei ricchi' si definisce in questo libro il processo che si avvierebbe con la concessione alle regioni delle nuove competenze così come richieste."_

**Quick Take**: Differentiated autonomy risks institutionalizing inequality by making regional disparities legally sanctioned rather than constitutionally opposed.

### Failed Decentralization in Italy

Viesti argues that Italy's major decentralization reforms since the 1990s, particularly the 2001 constitutional reform, have created a problematic system characterized by continuous conflicts between state and regions, weakened national government, and "regional sovereignty" tendencies. Instead of addressing these issues, current political debates focus on creating new problems through asymmetric decentralization. The current system fails three essential conditions for good decentralization: clarity on responsibilities, adequate resources for all territories, and citizen control over administrators with central government substitution powers.

> "The great process of decentralization of powers, particularly in favor of regions, that occurred in Italy from the 1990s onward has determined a highly unsatisfactory framework, rich in conflicts and problems."
> _Original: "Il grande processo di decentramento dei poteri, in particolare a favore delle regioni, che è avvenuto in Italia a partire dagli anni Novanta del XX secolo ha determinato un quadro assai insoddisfacente, ricco di conflitti e di problemi."_

**Quick Take**: Italy needs comprehensive reform of its decentralization systems, not further fragmentation through asymmetric autonomy.

### Dangerous International Precedents

The book examines international experiences with decentralization, highlighting the Spanish case as particularly relevant. Spain's asymmetric decentralization for "historical nationalities" like Catalonia and the Basque Country has created continuous competitive pressures among regions to acquire more powers and resources. This "mechanism of compulsory pursuit" generates an endless chase for autonomy that can destabilize national unity. The Catalan independence movement demonstrates how such processes can ultimately threaten state integrity, even if initially intended as autonomy within existing national frameworks.

> "When the moment comes to constitutionally ratify differentiation between autonomous communities, those that initially benefit from fewer competencies and resources subsequently undertake a process of progressive approximation toward communities with greater autonomy."
> _Original: "Nel momento in cui viene a ratificarsi costituzionalmente la differenziazione fra le CC.AA. quelle che inizialmente beneficiano di minore competenza e risorse avviano, successivamente, un percorso di progressivo avvicinamento alle CC.AA. dotate di maggiore autonomia."_

**Quick Take**: International experience shows that asymmetric decentralization often triggers competitive rather than cooperative dynamics among regions.

### Constitutional and Economic Risks

The constitutional framework for differentiated autonomy (Article 116, third comma of Italy's Constitution) was intended as a tool for "refinement and adjustment" of regional powers, not radical restructuring. However, current requests from regions effectively seek to rewrite Article 117, which governs the distribution of functions between state and regions. Economically, regions seek to retain their "fiscal residual" - the difference between tax revenue collected and public spending in their territories. This contradicts constitutional principles of progressive taxation and universal access to public services, potentially creating a "ius domicilii" that ties rights to residence location.

> "The regions requesting autonomy aim to obtain particular conditions to their advantage entirely assimilable to those of special autonomies."
> _Original: "Le regioni richiedenti mirano infatti a ottenere condizioni particolari a loro vantaggio del tutto assimilabili a quelle delle autonomie speciali."_

**Quick Take**: The current autonomy requests constitute backdoor constitutional reform that bypasses formal amendment procedures.

### Threats to National Services

If regions gain requested powers, Italy would see the end of unified national systems including public education, the national health service, and unified infrastructure management. Wealthier regions could create superior regional schools and healthcare systems, increasing rather than reducing inequality. The fragmentation of regulations across sectors like construction, food production, energy policy, and environmental protection would create significant obstacles for national businesses operating across regional boundaries. This comes precisely when the EU is working to create integrated markets and coordinated policies.

> "Italy would be radically transformed with the birth of region-states within it. The end of the Italian public school, the National Health Service, the unified system of infrastructure and energy."
> _Original: "L'Italia sarebbe radicalmente trasformata con la nascita di regioni-Stato al suo interno. Avrebbero fine la scuola pubblica italiana, il Servizio sanitario nazionale, il sistema unitario delle infrastrutture e dell'energia."_

**Quick Take**: Differentiated autonomy threatens the existence of unified national systems essential for social cohesion and economic integration.

## Takeaways

- **For Citizens**: Regional autonomy could fundamentally affect your access to public services like healthcare and education based on where you live, potentially creating a two-tier system of rights.

- **For Policymakers**: The book provides a detailed roadmap for why comprehensive decentralization reform, not asymmetric autonomy, is needed to address Italy's regional governance challenges.

- **For International Readers**: The Italian case offers valuable lessons about the risks of asymmetric decentralization and the importance of maintaining national unity while respecting regional diversity.

- **For Constitutional Scholars**: The analysis demonstrates how constitutional provisions intended for minor adjustments can be exploited for major structural changes without formal amendment procedures.

## Questions to Consider

1. How can countries balance legitimate regional demands for autonomy with the need to maintain national unity and equal rights for all citizens?

2. What constitutional safeguards are needed to prevent provisions for limited regional differentiation from becoming mechanisms for major structural change?

3. How should fiscal resources be distributed between central and regional governments to ensure both efficiency and equity?

4. What role should the EU play in managing regional autonomy movements within member states?

5. Can differentiated autonomy ever be compatible with the principle of equal citizenship rights?

## Conclusion

This book is essential reading for understanding one of Italy's most critical contemporary political debates. Viesti makes a compelling case that current proposals for differentiated autonomy, rather than solving Italy's long-standing regional governance problems, would actually exacerbate them. His analysis combines rigorous constitutional and economic reasoning with comparative international perspective to demonstrate why Italy needs comprehensive decentralization reform rather than further fragmentation.

The book's greatest strength lies in showing how technical questions about regional governance have profound implications for national unity, social equality, and democratic accountability. Viesti successfully argues that the current autonomy requests threaten to create institutionalized inequality between regions, transforming factual disparities into legally sanctioned differences in citizens' rights based on their residence.

While the author's perspective is clearly critical of differentiated autonomy, his arguments are well-researched and carefully reasoned. The book serves as both an important contribution to Italian constitutional scholarship and a warning to other countries considering similar decentralization paths. In an era of increasing regional tensions across Europe, the lessons from Italy's experience deserve wide attention.
