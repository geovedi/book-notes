The narrative introduces Richard Walter, the chaplain aboard the Centurion, who aimed to write the definitive chronicle of the expedition. However, Pascoe Thomas, the ship's schoolmaster, released his own account, titled "A True and Impartial Journal of a Voyage to the South-Seas," in an attempt to undermine Walter's monopoly.

## The Docket
The focus shifts to the court-martial that took place following the shipwreck of the Wager. It explores the legal proceedings and the verdict reached by the court, shedding light on the complexities and nuances of the case.

The chapter begins with the court-martial itself, where the surviving crew members of the Wager, including Captain Cheap and Lieutenant Bulkeley, presented their testimonies. The court deliberated on various accusations, including allegations of mutiny, desertion, and murder, trying to determine the extent of each individual's responsibility.

The narrative highlights the contrasting testimonies and perspectives of the involved parties. Captain Cheap defended his actions, arguing that he had done everything possible to save the crew and the ship. Lieutenant Bulkeley, on the other hand, presented a different account, claiming that Cheap had abandoned the crew and failed in his duties as a captain.

After a brief adjournment, the court returned with a unanimous verdict. The judge advocate read the decision, absolving Captain Cheap of any wrongdoing and stating that he had fulfilled his duty to preserve the ship. The other officers and crew members, except for Lieutenant Baynes, were also absolved, with Baynes receiving only a reprimand.

The chapter delves into the reasons behind the court's decision, exploring the bureaucratic justifications and interpretations of naval rules that led to the limited focus of the trial. It questions whether the court deliberately avoided addressing certain allegations to prevent either side's story from prevailing and to maintain the facade of British naval superiority.

Moreover, the chapter suggests that a comprehensive trial could have revealed unsettling truths about the British Empire's military ventures, such as the disastrous War of Jenkins' Ear and the motives behind it. The empire's desire to protect its image and maintain public support likely influenced the court's decision not to prosecute a conspicuous mutiny.

"The Docket" underscores the inherent challenges and limitations of seeking justice and accountability within a hierarchical and imperialistic system. It highlights how legal proceedings can be manipulated and shaped to serve specific interests, ultimately influencing the outcome and leaving certain aspects of the truth obscured.

The court listened to their testimonies, examining the allegations of mutiny, desertion, and the actions of Captain Cheap as the commanding officer.

The narrative highlights the contrasting perspectives and conflicting narratives presented during the trial. Captain Cheap defended his actions, claiming that he had done everything possible to save the crew and maintain order on the ship. Lieutenant Bulkeley, however, portrayed Cheap as negligent and accused him of abandoning the crew in their dire circumstances.

After a brief adjournment, the court reconvened and delivered its unanimous verdict.

## The Version That Won
The chapter explores the aftermath of the Wager affair and the competing narratives that emerged from the castaways' return to England. It delves into the efforts to shape and control the narrative surrounding the expedition, highlighting the role of publications and influential figures in constructing the prevailing account.

The chapter begins by introducing the three crew members from Bulkeley's party who eventually returned to England, including midshipman Isaac Morris. Their arrival marked the culmination of a long and arduous journey after being left behind on Wager Island. However, the chapter focuses primarily on the story of John Duck, the free Black seaman who had also gone ashore with Morris's abandoned party.

Duck's story stands out as a significant omission from the published accounts of the expedition. While Morris and others had the opportunity to record their testimonies, Duck's fate remains unknown. He was kidnapped and sold into slavery in Buenos Aires, and Morris lamented that his friend would likely never return to England. The chapter emphasizes the silence imposed by empires, the stories left untold, and the dark consequences suffered by those whose voices are silenced.

The narrative then shifts to the competition to publish the definitive account of Commodore Anson's expedition. Richard Walter, the Centurion's chaplain, had been writing his own chronicle, but Pascoe Thomas, the ship's schoolmaster, beat him to it by publishing his own version. Walter's account, titled A Voyage Round the World in the Years 1740â€“1744 by George Anson, eventually emerged as the most influential and widely read narrative of the expedition.

However, the chapter reveals that Walter's book was not solely his own work. Admiral Anson himself played a significant role in shaping and orchestrating the publication, providing source materials and employing a ghostwriter named Benjamin Robins. Anson's aim was to present his perspective and highlight the triumphs and glories of the British Empire, downplaying or omitting certain aspects of the expedition.

"The Version That Won" underscores the power of storytelling and how nations tailor narratives to serve their interests. Anson's carefully crafted account became a bestseller and influenced subsequent works.
