### Upside-Down Medicine
- Prediction of Corporate Management

  - Medical work rules aimed at productivity emerged, impacting doctors' time and interaction with patients.
- Evolution of Medical Practice
  - Despite remaining the highest-paid professionals in the U.S., doctors experienced increased work regulation and productivity expectations.
  - The organization Jim and his colleagues formed in 1985 defied this trend, dedicating ample time to patient care and adopting a patient-centered approach.
- Patient Engagement and Unconventional Approach
  - Their mission involved finding and persuading homeless patients to receive care.
  - Engaging patients required courting and building trust, often with those who had been neglected by the healthcare system.
  - Anecdote about Jim's encounter with the elderly professor, Harrison, highlighted the effort needed to connect with homeless patients.
- Human-Centered Medicine
  - Rather than a focus on vital signs, the priority was being present and standing with patients in their struggles, a philosophy reminiscent of a family doctor from Jim's childhood.
  - The Program aimed to mend broken individuals by addressing complex medical and social problems faced by homeless patients.
- Financial Transition and Expansion
  - The Program's unconventional approach persisted for the first four years, financed by grants that allowed them to focus on patients.

  - Taube's leadership brought financial stability but also led to changes that met resistance from clinicians.
  - Jim's difficulty in saying no complicated management efforts, but Taube's approach facilitated understanding and cooperation.

### Death by Housing
- A Snapshot of Lives
  - A photograph taken by a homeless woman captured a group of friends, most of them rough sleepers, sitting together in a park.
  - Six years later, only one of them was alive; the rest had died from diseases linked to their difficult lives, including alcoholism and tobacco use.
- Discovering the Cycle
  - Jim and his team discovered that histories of trauma, abuse, and neglect often led to mental disorders, substance abuse, and early deaths among their patients.
  - This realization underscored the critical importance of providing comprehensive care and support to the homeless population.
- Housing First Philosophy
  - The Housing First concept aimed to provide housing to chronically homeless individuals without requiring them to be "stabilized" first.
  - The idea was supported by data indicating that a small percentage of shelter users consumed a disproportionately large share of resources.
- A Test of Housing First
  - The Street Team received twenty-four housing vouchers as part of a pilot project to implement Housing First principles.
  - They found that most rough sleepers accepted the vouchers, a significant opportunity for those who had been on the streets for years.
  - The Street Team continued to provide medical care for these housed individuals despite Medicaid regulations.
- Challenges of Housing Transition
  - Housing proved to be a complex transition for many rough sleepers due to lack of experience with indoor living.
  - Apartments often located in unfamiliar areas, led to social isolation and difficulties in adapting to a structured indoor life.
  - Patients with schizophrenia fared better than those with more extroverted personalities, who often faced eviction due to partying and disruptions.
- Lessons from a New York Model
  - A New York model, Permanent Supportive Housing (PSH), showed success by combining housing with comprehensive support from specialized teams.
  - New York's model achieved an 88 percent retention rate over five years, proving that stable housing coupled with support can lead to positive outcomes.
- Mixed Results and Challenges
  - The Street Team's housing experiment didn't achieve the same level of resources as the New York model.
  - Despite initial success, many of the rough sleepers housed through vouchers faced eviction, alcohol-related deaths, or a lack of support and community.
- Assessment of the Housing First Approach
  - A study conducted over fourteen years revealed that only 12 percent of the originally housed individuals remained in stable housing.
  - While the Housing First philosophy held moral value, the study showed that housing alone wasn't sufficient to ensure long-term stability.
- Importance of Comprehensive Support
  - The study highlighted the need for extensive support beyond just housing, including treatment for underlying health issues and life skills education.
  - Insufficient support for patients' transition from street to apartment living led to challenges and often short-lived housing stability.
- Hope and Success Stories
  - Despite challenges, some individuals experienced positive transformations through housing.
  - A man in his fifties, who had battled alcoholism and lived on the streets, found success in an apartment near a supportive community and gained skills, even becoming a board member of the Program.
