# Saving Time: Discovering a Life Beyond the Clock
**Author**: Jenny Odell | **Year**: 2023

## Summary

"Saving Time" is a profound philosophical investigation into how modern society's understanding of time has been shaped by capitalist productivity, colonial exploitation, and consumer culture. Odell argues that our contemporary relationship with time—as a resource to be optimized, managed, and monetized—is historically constructed rather than natural. Through personal anecdotes, historical analysis, and deep ecological observation, she challenges readers to reconsider time not as a commodity but as a complex, multi-layered experience that connects us to the natural world, to each other, and to possibilities beyond the relentless clock of productivity.

This book will resonate with anyone feeling crushed by the pressure to be constantly productive, burned out by hustle culture, or seeking deeper meaning in their relationship with time and attention. It's especially valuable for those interested in philosophy, social justice, environmental thinking, and radical alternatives to capitalist ways of being.

## Core Insights

### Time as a Social and Political Construct

Odell reveals that our modern conception of time as uniform, measurable, and monetizable emerged from specific historical forces—particularly colonial plantations and industrial capitalism. She demonstrates how time was systematically transformed from a natural, cyclical experience into "labor-time-as-commodity"—standardized, free-floating, and infinitely divisible, just like other products of exploitation. This transformation wasn't neutral; it was designed to extract maximum value from human bodies and natural resources, creating hierarchies where some people's time is valued while others' is treated as expendable.

> "Whether miners are paid by the piece or by the hour, time for them is a wage, a means of survival, and the most valuable thing they have to sell. The man trying to sleep in the café might have been a miner, given that, like the hundreds of tourists who climb the volcano each weekend during the high season, the miners must also make predawn trips up the mountain from the base."

**Why This Matters**: Understanding that our time anxiety is historically constructed rather than natural opens possibilities for reclaiming different relationships with time. It reveals how personal time struggles connect to larger systems of power and exploitation.

### Two Types of Time: Chronos vs. Kairos

The book introduces a crucial distinction between two ancient Greek concepts of time. **Chronos** is linear, sequential time—the clock time that rules our schedules, deadlines, and productivity metrics. **Kairos** is qualitative, opportune time—the "right moment," the pregnant pause, the deep presence that transcends clock time. Odell argues that modern life has almost entirely eliminated kairos, trapping us in the horizontal realm of chronos where every moment is equivalent and exchangeable.

> "The future is always over the horizon, and to be alive is to be in transit. For a few minutes, a sunrise collects all that ineffable bittersweetness into a single burning point."

**Why This Matters**: Recognizing kairos moments helps us reclaim time's depth and meaning. It suggests that resistance to clock-time domination isn't about "slowing down" but about finding those vertical moments that transcend productivity logic entirely.

### The Myth and Reality of Leisure

Odell challenges both commercialized leisure experiences and nostalgic idealizations of public leisure spaces. She reveals how leisure has always been entangled with social hierarchies, racial exclusion, and capitalist co-optation. From segregated pools and redlined parks to Instagram "self-care" that serves the wellness industry, she shows how leisure often reinforces rather than resists dominant power structures. Yet she also identifies radical forms of leisure—collective napping, community gardens, activist spaces—that offer genuine alternatives.

> "Leisure is not refreshment-for-work but something completely different that exists for its own sake. It involves a mixture of awe and gratitude that 'springs precisely from our inability to understand, from our recognition of the mysterious nature of the universe.'"

**Why This Matters**: This analysis helps us distinguish between pseudo-leisure that ultimately serves productivity and genuine leisure that creates space for different ways of being and relating to time.

### Ecological Time as Resistance

One of the book's most powerful arguments is that attuning ourselves to ecological time—seasonal cycles, geological processes, biological rhythms—offers profound resistance to capitalist time. Watching a hill turn yellow, water carrying rocks downhill, or a tree flowering and dying reminds us that time operates on scales completely different from quarterly reports and daily deadlines. This ecological awareness connects us to deeper temporal flows that industrial capitalism tries to ignore or dominate.

> "At the time, I was learning that whether you see an inert world or an agential one—whether something like Ijen is a pile of stuff or a subject deserving of regard—is an outgrowth of an age-old distinction about who gets to occupy time and who (and what) does not."

**Why This Matters**: Ecological awareness provides both practical and philosophical tools for resisting time oppression. It reminds us that the world continues on its own schedule, regardless of human productivity demands.

### Time as Collective Liberation

The book builds toward a vision of time liberation that's both personal and collective. Drawing on activists like Tricia Hersey of The Nap Ministry, Odell shows how rest and attention reclamation can be forms of political resistance, especially for communities whose time and bodies have been systematically exploited. She emphasizes that changing our relationship with time requires both personal practice and structural change—individual mindfulness won't solve systemic time poverty and exploitation.

> "I reread these words in 2020, in the weeks following George Floyd's murder, which were full of such upwellings. For me, this time was an unforgettable illustration of the relationship among kairos, action, and surprise. Time took on new topographies, and the author Herman Gray contrasted 'the slow time of COVID and the hot time of the streets.'"

**Why This Matters**: This framework connects personal time struggles to larger movements for justice and liberation, suggesting that reclaiming time is essential for building more humane and sustainable ways of living together.

## Best Quotes

- "I believe that a real meditation on the nature of time, unbound from its everyday capitalist incarnation, shows that neither our lives nor the life of the planet is a foregone conclusion. In that sense, the idea that we could 'save' time—by recovering its fundamentally irreducible and inventive nature—could also mean that time saves us."

- "Whether conspicuous, compensatory, or both, consumption has long had a relationship to leisure, which can make leisure a strange kind of circumscribed freedom. Although leisure is typically defined in opposition to work, the cut that separates the two is also what has historically joined them."

- "The future is always over the horizon, and to be alive is to be in transit. For a few minutes, a sunrise collects all that ineffable bittersweetness into a single burning point."

- "What if these actions were not the mindless ticking of a clockwork universe, but the actions of a who? At the time, I was learning that whether you see an inert world or an agential one—whether something like Ijen is a pile of stuff or a subject deserving of regard—is an outgrowth of an age-old distinction about who gets to occupy time and who (and what) does not."

- "In the midst of calls to 'get back to normal,' this book was written in kairos for kairos—for a vanishing window in which the time is ripe. In any moment, we can choose whom and what we perceive as existing in time, just as we can choose to believe that time is the site of unpredictability and potential rather than inevitability and helplessness."

## Questions to Consider

- How has your relationship with time been shaped by productivity expectations, work schedules, and the idea that time equals money?
- Where do you experience kairos moments—those times when clock time seems to fall away and you're fully present?
- How might your perception of time change if you attuned more closely to seasonal, geological, or biological cycles in your local environment?
- In what ways does your access to leisure and "free time" depend on other people's labor and time exploitation?
- What would it mean to "save time" not by being more efficient, but by recovering time's fundamentally irreducible and inventive nature?
- How can personal practices of attention and rest connect to larger movements for time justice and liberation?

## Conclusion

"Saving Time" is not another productivity book with time management hacks—it's a radical reconceptualization of time itself. Odell's panoramic assault on time nihilism offers both philosophical depth and practical insight for anyone feeling crushed by clock-time domination. Her analysis reveals how our personal time anxieties connect to larger systems of exploitation, while her vision of ecological and collective time liberation suggests concrete paths toward more humane ways of being.

This book is worth your time if you're ready to question the fundamental assumption that time is a resource to be optimized. It's especially valuable for those seeking philosophical grounding for resistance to hustle culture, burnout recovery, or deeper connection to natural cycles beyond capitalist productivity. While occasionally dense in its historical analysis, the book rewards patient reading with transformative insights that can permanently shift how you experience both minutes and meaning.

The biggest reason to read this book is its hopeful reframing: time liberation isn't about personal efficiency but about recognizing time's fundamentally creative, unpredictable nature—and choosing to align ourselves with those forces of invention rather than domination. In an era of climate crisis and systemic exploitation, Odell suggests that changing how we think about time might be essential for imagining and building survivable futures.
