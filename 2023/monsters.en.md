***

"Monsters" by Claire Dederer is a thought-provoking and introspective book that explores various themes such as art, monstrosity, love, addiction, and personal identity. Through a collection of chapters, the author delves into these complex topics with honesty and vulnerability, sharing personal anecdotes, reflections, and cultural references.

The book examines the moral implications of engaging with art created by individuals who have committed terrible acts. Dederer raises questions about separating the artist from their art and explores the subjective nature of consuming and appreciating creative works. The chapter titled "Lady Lazarus" specifically delves into this theme, referencing Sylvia Plath's poem of the same name as a touchstone for the discussion.

Another significant theme in the book is the concept of monstrosity and how it relates to personal and artistic identity. Dederer contemplates what makes someone a monster and examines her own flaws and failings as a writer. She explores the selfishness and ambition required for artistic success and reflects on the societal expectations placed upon women in regards to motherhood and creative pursuits.

Alcoholism and its impact on individuals and relationships is also explored in the book.

The book also delves into the power of art, particularly music and literature, in shaping personal experiences and emotions. Dederer emphasizes the transformative nature of art and its ability to evoke strong emotions, inspire introspection, and provide solace. The chapter titled "The Beloveds" focuses on the profound impact of music and literature on the author's life and explores the sense of personal connection and community that can arise from engaging with art.

Throughout the book, Dederer navigates the complexities of these themes with a nuanced and introspective perspective. She raises important questions, challenges societal norms and expectations, and encourages readers to critically engage with the multifaceted nature of art, identity, and relationships.

Overall, "Monsters" is a compelling and insightful exploration of various aspects of human existence, inviting readers to reflect on their own experiences, beliefs, and connections to art and the world around them.

## The Child Rapist
The author finds themselves captivated by Roman Polanski's works despite being aware of his criminal actions. They struggle to reconcile their love for his films with their disapproval of his behavior. Attempting to address this dilemma through analysis and contemplation, they come to realize that there are no clear solutions to the problem of Polanski.

Seeking guidance, the author consults with an intellectual historian who advises exploring the works of other artists like V.S. Naipaul or Ezra Pound. However, the author remains uncertain about how to approach Polanski's work without clear answers.

Throughout history, the author is disappointed by the actions of beloved male artists, raising questions about how audiences should respond to problematic artists rather than focusing solely on the artists themselves. They even wish for a calculator to determine whether it is morally acceptable to consume the work of abusive artists.

Different opinions on the matter abound, ranging from calls to destroy all work by abusive artists to advocating for a separation of art from the artist. The author has grappled with these questions for years, only recently realizing the profound significance they hold.

Despite the controversy and Polanski's problematic history with feminism, the author remains enraptured by the film "Rosemary's Baby." However, a significant event, an accident, and injury on the way to a documentary recording seem to curse the film for them, further dividing the unscathed from the broken and solidifying the author's place in the latter category.

## Roll Call
The author reflects on famous artists and celebrities who have been accused of wrongdoing but continue to be celebrated for their art. They question whether it is possible to separate the artist from their transgressions and explore the impact of the #MeToo movement, particularly in light of the Access Hollywood tape.

They share their personal reaction to the Woody Allen scandal and how it has affected their enjoyment of his films. Despite their struggle to reconcile Allen's personal life with his art, they revisit his film "Annie Hall," acknowledging its charm, style, and themes. "Annie Hall" is considered one of the greatest comic films of the 20th century.

The author grapples with conflicting emotions and opinions about Woody Allen while gathering his books for research with the help of a friend. They take a mini tour of Allen's films, including "Manhattan," but approach it with an open mind.

During the film "Manhattan," they observe the nonchalant portrayal of a middle-aged man dating a high schooler and the portrayal of women as objects of desire and caricatured representations. Watching "Manhattan" in the context of the #MeToo movement becomes difficult.

The author reflects on the power of the Weinstein story in sparking the #MeToo movement and the dilemma of separating the art from the artist after this movement. They share their mixed feelings towards men and patriarchal culture during the fall of 2017.

A debate arises over whether artwork should be judged strictly on aesthetics or whether the artist's biography should shape its perception and question objectivity.

The audience's new responsibility emerges as they feel compelled to denounce monsters and navigate moral feelings. The author recognizes the human capacity for badness and admits to being fascinated by people who do terrible things.

They observe a political impulse to blame others and create an "us vs. them" dynamic in society. The complexity of grappling with problematic artists and their art in the wake of the #MeToo movement becomes a significant part of their reflection.

## The Stain
In her exploration of the word "monster" and the concept of "art monsters" in Jenny Offill's novel "Dept. of Speculation," the author delves into the limitations of labeling someone as a monster. She contends that such a term diverts attention from the experiences of the victims and raises questions about her own feminism conflicting with the desire to understand power dynamics as a whole.

The author grapples with her own conflicting emotions, particularly her attraction to artists with problematic behavior, citing examples like Roman Polanski and Woody Allen. She introduces the idea of a "stain" on an artist's work, a term that seems more fitting than "monster" as it encompasses how such actions affect the audience's perception and cannot be easily separated from the artist's body of work.

The concept of the "stain" is further explored as the author contends that it taints the artist's work from the moment the abusive actions occur, retroactively altering our perception of the artist's entire life and creations. Drawing from personal experiences, the author discusses her encounters with problematic artists like Roman Polanski and Michael Jackson, acknowledging the prevalence of biographical information accessible through the internet and mass media, leaving one unable to escape knowledge of an artist's crimes.

The notion of "cancel culture" is introduced in connection with the belief that we now have access to comprehensive information about almost everyone. The stain left by an artist's abusive actions, the author argues, significantly affects how the audience perceives their work, creating a blurred line between the person and their art.

## The Fan
The rise of fan culture coincides with the prevalence of biography and cancel culture, where fans play a crucial role in the market but are not often considered special. Fans strongly identify with the art they consume, and their obsession signals an intense appreciation and a sense of special status. They prioritize an artist's biography and feel a closer relationship with them, especially with the advent of the internet and social media, which intensify our connection with celebrities.

The concept of parasocial relationships, false-yet-real-feeling connections, has become common in the fan culture. While these connections can be enjoyable, they may not always be healthy as our brains struggle with feeling directly addressed by broadcasters and celebrities. In the context of late capitalism, our preferences and choices as consumers hold significance, and there is a dream of achieving telepathy and a perfect union between artists and audiences through technology.

However, these parasocial relationships can create confusion, leading some to believe in relationships outside the realm of art. Tech giants have capitalized on these connections, monetizing them for their benefit, essentially using fans' intense ties to artists to generate profit for others.

The impact of these close ties becomes more destructive when artists become controversial, as witnessed in the case of J.K. Rowling, whose alignment with the gender identity movement caused backlash among former fans, particularly the trans community. For many, works like the Harry Potter books became intertwined with their childhood identity and sense of belonging. Platforms like Tumblr fostered the DIY movement and fan creations, providing a community and belonging for many, including queer kids within the Harry Potter fandom.

However, the internet era also intensifies shame in the fan-artist relationship. Emotions and identity become deeply intertwined with beloved artists, leaving fans vulnerable to the rapidly shifting dynamics of fan culture in the digital age.

## The Critic
In the author's journey as a critic, their interest in criticism was sparked by their seventh-grade English teacher, Ms. Smith. As they ventured into film criticism for a local alternative paper in their mid-twenties, they struggled with the tension between authority and subjectivity. Among a group of male film critics, they felt like an outsider and questioned their own qualifications and authority in the field.

In their reviews, the author questioned the traditional structure and limitations of capturing the subjective experience of art. They found difficulty in making definitive critical pronouncements and felt stuck in subjectivity, which was often seen as something to be hidden from other critics. However, they embraced the use of the first-person perspective ("I") in their reviews to express their authentic response, inspired by their subjective writing from childhood that reflected their own experiences.

The author believed that the intimacy of reading criticism came from a shared experience between the critic and the reader. They observed that many male critics often saw their perspective as universal, leaving out the experiences of others. In contrast, subjective criticism appeared more inclusive, allowing for a diverse range of perspectives.

The lack of representation and exclusion of marginalized groups in the realm of criticism contributed to the feeling of being left out. The author emphasized the importance of critics acknowledging their subjectivity and biases when engaging with art, recognizing that feelings and opinions are influenced by personal circumstances and history.

They further stressed that even straight white men should understand that their feelings are also influenced by history. The author's own personal experiences shaped their perspective on art created by "monstrous men," leading to a tension between wanting to consume art and acknowledging the harm caused by the artists.

The concept of objectivity was seen as an illusion, while subjectivity was considered a human trick. When engaging with art by problematic artists, the author urged readers to challenge nostalgia and consider the harm caused. Love and emotional connection should be considered alongside critical thought.

For young people, the question of engaging with art by problematic artists becomes urgent. The case of PWR BTTM served as an example of how accusations can complicate fans' relationships with music, and individuals may still choose to engage with the art despite the harm caused by the artist.

Ultimately, the engagement with art is subjective, and there is no universal rule for how one should respond. Each individual's perspective is unique, shaped by their personal experiences and beliefs.

## The Genius
The concept of genius has historically allowed individuals to escape criticism and accountability. Genius is not merely talent; it is a status that comes with importance and privilege. Society's obsession with genius grants us the power to impose our opinions and ideals onto these individuals. The association of genius with famous men from the past, such as Picasso and Hemingway, further perpetuates this notion.

In the contemporary context, the ideal of genius is often portrayed as a master and servant to their own creative powers. Geniuses may have control over their work, but they often lose control over themselves. They channel external energy and impulses into their creations, which can be both freeing and confusing, leading to difficulty in differentiating between good and bad impulses.

For artists, the need to maintain creativity requires freedom in all their actions. The artistic genius is considered above all else free, expressing this freedom not only in their content but also in the form of their work. Renowned artists like Joyce, Picasso, Pollock, Elvis, Hendrix, Ginsberg, and Kerouac are often labeled as geniuses.

However, the image of genius can be problematic when it allows for license in their actions without consequences for others. Picasso's abusive behavior towards women, for example, is crucial to understanding his work. Both Picasso and Gauguin exercised control over their public and private images, shaping the perception of their art.

Hemingway, another celebrated genius, had fame intertwined with his masculinity and reputation for violence. He had complicated relationships and left a destructive legacy. Hemingway's misogynistic and anti-Semitic outlook, along with mean remarks about fellow writers, highlight the darker aspects of the genius persona.

Debates persist on whether madness makes a great artist or if freedom leads to madness. The image of the artist as an outsider to societal norms is often associated with male figures. Freedom as a rock star allows for wildness and nonconformity, though black artists like Kanye West face limitations compared to white male rock stars.

The allure of bad people, particularly male artists, is tied to the concept of genius. The contradictory and inconsistent nature of these stars adds to their allure. Consuming the spectacle of their badness involves a mix of guilt and enjoyment.

## The Anti-Semite, the Racist, and the Problem of Time
The author reflects on a conversation about meeting Trumpists with open hearts, juxtaposed with the fear experienced by their Jewish friend at a synagogue. This leads to a challenge to the idea that society didn't know any better in the past, citing the #MeToo movement as an example of how societal injustices that were once accepted and normalized are now being confronted.

The concept of the Past is explored, and the author questions their own perspective as an audience member of the present. They ponder whether they might have an arrogance in thinking they are more enlightened than people in the past.

The discussion turns to Stephen Fry's desire to prevent Richard Wagner's expression of anti-Semitic views. Despite Wagner's awareness of counterarguments against anti-Semitism, he actively chose to embrace it. Wagner's use of the word "we" to normalize his hateful perspective is likened to tactics used by Trump supporters.

The idea that people in the past didn't know better is challenged, as Wagner knew better but still allowed himself to be consumed by hatred. This conflict resonates with Stephen Fry's love for Wagner's music despite the composer's association with Hitler and Nazism. The support of Wagner's family for the Nazi regime, particularly Winifred Wagner's admiration for Hitler, further complicates the matter.

The author emphasizes that Wagner's anti-Semitism is a stain on his work that should not be excused or overlooked. This leads to a mention of Virginia Woolf's anti-Semitic tendencies, despite her association with the Bloomsbury group and advocacy for liberalism.

The connection between racism and domination is explored, evident in American classics like "Little House on the Prairie" and "My Antonia." The exclusion and dehumanization of Native Americans in westward expansion are highlighted, along with examples of racism in literature, such as the portrayal of Indians as threats and the use of blackface in "Little Town on the Prairie."

The importance of acknowledging and confronting anti-Semitism and racism in historical figures and literature is emphasized. The author reflects on their childhood love for "Little House on the Prairie" and how they came to realize its inherent racism.

The author critiques the conditional tense and the belief in moral superiority, which may hinder understanding history and our role in it. They explore the seductive belief in moral progress and its blinding effect on perceiving the realities of the world.

The question of what to do with art and figures from the past now seen as monstrous is raised, and the author challenges the idea of progress and enlightenment, pointing out the lack of outrage over certain actions during the Trump presidency.

The argument for cancel culture as a necessary part of the reckoning process is presented, along with the trade-off between shame and the ability to speak out. The author critiques the liberal fantasy of effortless enlightenment and emphasizes the necessity of actively listening to those who point out what is wrong.

## The Anti-Monster
Lolita, a novel by Vladimir Nabokov, has long been perceived as problematic, giving rise to questions about the author's intentions and the purpose of the story. When first reading the book as a teenager, the narrator found it disturbing and unsatisfying. Nabokov's portrayal of the protagonist, Humbert, as a monstrous character, has led to speculation about the author himself and his understanding of monstrousness.

The storyline of Lolita would likely be met with controversy if published today, given its sensitive subject matter. Throughout the novel, Humbert claims to have a special and unique love for Lolita, but this claim is consistently subverted, revealing his ordinary nature as a predator.

Lolita's vulnerability and accessibility make her appealing to Humbert, who eventually realizes his own ordinariness and the destruction he has caused. He even questions his own specialness compared to other perpetrators, suggesting that he is no different from them.

The character of Quilty, who is intertwined with Humbert throughout the story, further emphasizes Humbert's non-specialness. Lolita herself recognizes this ordinariness after he rapes her, and it becomes evident that Nabokov portrays Humbert as ordinary to highlight the tragedy of Lolita's victimization, which is not unique.

The book, ultimately, is a poignant reflection on the ubiquity of Lolita's plight and the devastating consequences of stealing her personhood. As Humbert gradually recognizes Lolita's personhood, it does not redeem him from his dark desires.

Lolita's absence in the novel serves as a symbolic representation of the silence and erasure of other victims of child abuse. Nabokov's writing might have been driven by his own monstrous desires, but he did not act on them, making a clear distinction between the depiction of dark desires in literature and the actual actions.

Taking a risk, Nabokov cast himself as a monster in the narrative to tell the story of Lolita and create empathy for victims of child abuse. The novel effectively captures the profound destruction of innocence and the enormity of stealing a childhood.

## The Silencers and the Silenced
In the art world, the author reflects on the pervasive silence and the voices that often go unheard. Deborah Levy's memoir sheds light on the absence of female writers in the literary journals she read during her teenage years, revealing the systemic barriers women faced in gaining recognition for their work.

The death of artist Ana Mendieta is a poignant example of the overshadowing and erasure of her powerful earth-body works by her husband, Carl Andre, a prominent minimalist sculptor. Mendieta's feminist and confrontational art stands in stark contrast to Andre's minimalist approach.

The controversy surrounding Carl Andre's trial raises important questions about the treatment of women of color in the art world. The Women's Action Coalition took a stand, organizing protests to demand inclusion and representation of marginalized voices like Mendieta's in museums and cultural institutions.

One noteworthy protest, titled "Crying; A Protest," took place at Dia: Beacon, where women cried in front of Carl Andre's installations to bring attention to the silencing of female artists like Mendieta and the need for change in the art world.

The author emphasizes the significance of taking up space in cultural institutions and the necessity of creating fair and inclusive spaces that recognize and promote the work of artists from diverse backgrounds. By raising awareness and demanding equality, the art world can move towards amplifying the voices that have long been silenced and fostering a more equitable and just artistic landscape.

## Am I a Monster?
In a soul-searching moment, the author grapples with the idea of their own monstrosity, particularly in the pursuit of artistic expression. They reflect on the inherent selfishness required to be an artist, acknowledging the conflict between their creative passion and the responsibilities of motherhood.

The tension between art-making and family life is a constant struggle, as the author contemplates the solitude necessary for their craft and the demands of raising a family. The "pram in the hall" trope serves as a poignant reminder of the challenges faced by artists who are also parents, torn between the desire for uninterrupted creative space and the responsibilities of nurturing.

The image of a writer alone, free from interruptions, becomes an elusive ideal for the author. They ponder the selfishness and ruthlessness often associated with male writers, comparing it to the societal expectations placed on female artists, who are expected to prioritize family and selflessness.

Yearning to be more monstrous, the author questions whether fully embracing selfishness would unlock their artistic potential. They contemplate the differing ambitions and boundaries of male and female artists, recognizing the double standards that label assertive women as selfish or monstrous.

Amid their own ambition, the author grapples with feelings of shame, wondering if their pursuit of artistic greatness comes at the expense of being a good person. Longing for the support and boundaries that a wife might provide, they find solace in the idea of an isolated island, a symbolic substitute for the support they seek.

Completing artistic work often requires sacrifices that make the author feel like a monster. They reflect on the societal pressure placed on women who prioritize art over motherhood, often being labeled as terrible mothers or actual monsters.

The notion that artistic greatness can compensate for being a morally flawed human being raises ethical questions for the author. They are left pondering whether all ambitious artists and finishers are inherently monsters or if there is a way to reconcile their ambitions with their values.

## Abandoning Mothers
While staying alone in Marfa, Texas, the author finds themselves reflecting on the concept of female monsters and women who abandon their children. This fascination began after meeting a man whose wife left him and their children, prompting them to contemplate the struggles of motherhood and the conflict between raising children and pursuing a writing career.

The idea of women who abandon their children is seen as a heinous crime, and the author mentions examples of famous writers who have made this choice in pursuit of their careers. They draw a personal connection to Doris Lessing's novel, "The Golden Notebook," which delves into themes of freedom and motherhood.

As the author reflects on their own experience as a mother, they recognize the societal pressures that make it difficult for women to prioritize their work. They question why some women struggle to see the impersonal nature of these societal pressures, leading them to make the decision to abandon their children.

Comparing the experiences of Doris Lessing and Muriel Spark, two prominent female writers, the author explores the complexities of their choices. They also mention the complicated relationship between Anne Sexton and her daughter Linda Gray Sexton, delving into the challenges of balancing motherhood and art.

The author discusses Lessing's relationship with Jenny Diski and the ambivalence Lessing felt towards motherhood. They question the sacrifices made by artists who are also parents, pondering the judgment society places on mothers who prioritize their careers over their children.

Marfa, Texas, serves as a contradiction, being a small town and an art pilgrimage site. In this environment, the author feels lonely and scared, as they become defined more by their work than their role as a mother.

The author questions what constitutes abandoning children and explores various scenarios where mothers may face different judgments compared to fathers when leaving their children for work or art. Pregnancy is seen as limiting women's options and artistic freedom, adding to the complexity of balancing motherhood with creative pursuits.

Examining Joni Mitchell's decision to give up her child and focus on her career, the author reflects on the different ways artist-mothers navigate their identities and choices. Mitchell faced challenges, sexism, and backlash in her career, but her refusal to compromise made her music evocative and powerful.

The stain of knowledge about artists' lives affects the perception of their work, raising moral complexities. Both Mitchell and Lessing's artistic greatness may have come from mysterious sources beyond their personal lives.

Inspired by Mitchell's life as an artist, the author reflects on their own journey as a writer, acknowledging the struggles of being a female artist and mother. This journey leads them to encounter a snake at the Chinati Foundation, symbolizing the hidden struggles of artists beneath their achievements.

## Lady Lazarus
During the Brett Kavanaugh hearings, the author reflects on feeling overwhelmed and powerless. They observe that female rage and violence are often not given the same consideration as male violence, and this discrepancy troubles them deeply.

The author then delves into the figure of Valerie Solanas and her infamous SCUM Manifesto, which advocated for the elimination of men. Solanas believed that men were inadequate and used power to compensate for their shortcomings. In 1968, she shot Andy Warhol and Mario Amaya but did not achieve her goal of eliminating men entirely.

Despite its radical nature, the SCUM Manifesto gained attention and has been viewed as transgressive. The author raises questions about the relationship between Solanas' act and her manifesto, as the document served as a medium for her expression of rage.

Shifting the focus to Sylvia Plath, the author notes that her literary work is often overshadowed by knowledge of her suicide. Plath and Solanas represent different aspects of the feminist movement. The SCUM Manifesto can be seen as both a call to action and a memoir, providing insights into Solanas' perspective.

Both Plath and Solanas are stained by acts of violence, which creates a double bind in their work. The author acknowledges that their art exposes the limitations of radical feminism and raises important questions about gender essentialism.

In the context of artistic greatness, the violence of male artists is often tied to their perceived genius, while the violence of female artists is rarely seen as a sign of creative and moral strength.

Solanas' extreme radical feminism serves as an example of the limits of the movement, prompting the author to question society's preoccupation with crimes committed by men and the overshadowing of female artists' work.

## Drunks
The author grapples with the complex concept of empathy for wrongdoers and monstrous individuals, especially artists accused of misconduct. They ponder the significance of Raymond Carver's redemption story and how his writing has left a lasting impact on the literary world. However, they question the influence of Carver's editor, Gordon Lish, in shaping his work.

The author then reflects on their personal journey of quitting drinking and finding redemption. They acknowledge that quitting drinking has led them to confront their own monstrosity, influenced by their experiences as a survivor of abuse and trauma. In recovery, they find solace and empathy, allowing them to continue living without alcohol.

The discussion shifts to the dilemma of what to do with art created by monstrous men. The author questions the role of consumer responsibility and individual choices in addressing this issue. They emphasize that simply focusing on monstrous men takes attention away from holding the system and perpetrators accountable for their actions.

In the era of social media and the internet, the author acknowledges how biography and fandom shape our relationships with artists. The practice of canceling celebrities reinforces a false dichotomy of good and bad celebrities, oversimplifying complex situations.

The author challenges the notion that our consumption of art can make us better or worse people or solve ethical dilemmas. They argue that love for art is a complicated matter, and there is no definitive answer on what to do with art created by monstrous men.

The author asserts that consumers are not solely responsible for finding the answer or resolving this contradiction. There is no clear authority in this matter, and it remains a complex and ongoing discussion.

## The Beloveds
The author delves into the significance of beauty when it comes to the art created by monstrous individuals. They draw parallels between the debate of utility versus aesthetics in choosing the best kind of tree, highlighting the power of beauty and its emotional force. The author shares their personal experience with Miles Davis's music and the profound impact it had on their life. They emphasize the emotional connection they feel towards art and how art-love is a subjective and intimate experience.

Art, according to the author, plays a crucial role in shaping and marking people's lives, reflecting the unique and varied responses individuals have to it. They reference E.M. Forster's depiction of personal responses to art in Howard's End. The author shares their passionate and emotionally connected experience with Pearl Cleage's Kind of Blue.

However, the author grapples with conflicted feelings towards Miles Davis and his music due to his history of abusing women. They express guilt and complexity in loving Davis's music despite being aware of his abusive behavior. The author wrestles with the notion of venerating Black men while also acknowledging the harm they may have caused, particularly against Black womanhood.

Confirmation of Davis's abusive tendencies through his autobiography and accounts from his wife further intensifies the author's feelings of betrayal. They ponder the relationship between consuming art and the biographies of the artist and audience member. The subjective response to Davis's music is recognized, acknowledging that it may weaken the argument, but it remains a genuine expression of emotions.

The author reflects on the evolution of their feelings towards Davis over time, showing the fluidity in their relationship with problematic artists. They raise the question of what to do with the art of monstrous individuals and how it parallels the experience of loving terrible people in our lives. The concept of love is portrayed as an act of mercy that transcends judgment and embraces flawed individuals, drawing parallels to the unconditional love the author receives from their children.

The author shares a hopeful sentiment that artists may grow and change, and that despite their flaws, we can continue to appreciate their work. Love, as described by the author, is a chaotic force separate from rational judgment, intertwining emotions and complexities.
