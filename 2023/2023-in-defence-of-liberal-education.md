# In Defence of Liberal Education
**Authors**: Anthony O'Hear | **Year**: 2023
**Category**: Philosophy & Critical Thinking

## Summary
Anthony O'Hear presents a vigorous philosophical defence of traditional liberal education against progressive educational theories and state control. He argues that liberal education—understood as education for freedom through disciplined initiation into the best that has been thought and known—is essential for genuine human development and intellectual liberation. The book contrasts this approach with progressive education theories from Rousseau to Dewey, critiques modern educational myths, and warns against state-controlled education that creates "a despotism over the mind." O'Hear ultimately advocates for educational deregulation and parental rights as the best means to preserve liberal education in modern Western democracies.

This book will benefit educators, policymakers, parents, and anyone concerned about the purpose and direction of education in modern society. Readers will gain a deeper understanding of the philosophical foundations of education, the dangers of utilitarian approaches to learning, and compelling arguments for educational freedom.

## Core Insights

### Education for Freedom Through Discipline
Liberal education, O'Hear argues, is fundamentally "education for freedom" but one that requires discipline and external guidance rather than the unrestricted freedom championed by progressive educators. Drawing on classical Greek philosophy, he contends that children are "not when young fully human" and become fully human only through initiation into established traditions of knowledge, virtue, and sensibility. This contrasts sharply with progressive models like A.S. Neill's Summerhill, where children follow their own interests without external structure.

> "The liberal educator sees freedom in terms of the ability of the learner to participate in and add to the conversations of mankind... By contrast, the freedom envisaged by the progressive is that championed by Francis Bacon... the freedom of the man who dives into the River Lethe, erasing from his soul the memory of all knowledge, all art, all poetry."

**Quick Take**: True freedom comes from mastering traditions, not rejecting them. Without disciplined initiation into cultural and intellectual heritage, we remain "barbarians at a loss in a temple whose meaning [we] do not understand."

### The State's Corrupting Influence on Education
O'Hear mounts a powerful critique of state-controlled education, arguing that the state inevitably uses education to promote its own interests—nation building, economic utility, social engineering—rather than genuine learning. He cites J.S. Mill's warning that "a general state education is a mere contrivance for moulding people to be exactly like one another" and establishes "a despotism over the mind." Even when well-intentioned, state control leads to ideological indoctrination and the sacrifice of educational excellence for political goals.

> "In proportion as it is efficient and successful, it establishes a despotism over the mind, leading by natural tendency to one over the body."

**Quick Take**: State education inevitably becomes a tool for political and social engineering, suppressing genuine intellectual freedom and diversity of thought.

### The Myth of Progress: Rousseau, Dewey, and Progressive Education
O'Hear traces modern educational problems to Enlightenment thinkers, particularly Rousseau's sentimental view of childhood as a "lost paradise" and Dewey's pragmatist rejection of eternal truths. He argues that progressive education's emphasis on relevance, pupil choice, and creativity without foundation actually limits children's development. Dewey's vision of education as problem-solving for present needs, while appealing, denies students access to the wisdom accumulated across generations.

> "What we say about the inter-relatedness of reasoning and moral judgement will depend to a considerable degree on how we think of reasoning... moral behaviour is not piloted by the intellectual grasp of true propositions."

**Quick Take**: Progressive education's rejection of tradition and eternal truths leaves students intellectually impoverished and unable to distinguish between genuine wisdom and passing fashions.

### Character and Reason: The Aristotelian Synthesis
In Chapter 4, O'Hear presents a sophisticated account of moral development that integrates character formation with reasoning ability. Against the modern emphasis on "critical thinking" divorced from character, he argues following Aristotle that moral judgment requires "an intertwined development of character and reason, alongside a growing and often fraught, if not actually painful, immersion in the complexities and intricacies of life." Practical wisdom cannot be reduced to logical reasoning or abstract principles but emerges from lived experience and virtuous habits.

> "What is required is an 'initiation into the moral and intellectual habits and achievements of (one's) society, an entry into the partnership between past and present, a sharing of concrete knowledge'."

**Quick Take**: Moral education requires both character formation and intellectual development, grounded in concrete traditions and experiences rather than abstract reasoning alone.

### Parental Rights and Educational Freedom
O'Hear makes a robust case for parental rights in education, citing both the 1948 UN Declaration of Human Rights and the 1944 British Education Act. He argues that parents have a "prior right" to choose their children's education because children belong to neither the state nor their parents but to themselves. While not approving all parental choices, he maintains that a deregulated system with parental responsibility offers the best chance for liberal education to flourish, despite its imperfections.

> "Parents have a prior right to choose the kind of education that shall be given to their children."

**Quick Take**: Educational freedom requires respecting parental rights while recognizing that this freedom serves the child's development into an autonomous adult rather than parental or state control.

## Best Quotes
- "Liberal education, as I am understanding it, is an education for freedom. 'Liberal' in the phrase 'liberal education' derives from the Latin 'liber' = free"
- "True enlargement of mind which is the power of viewing many things at once as one whole, of understanding their respective values, and determining their mutual dependence"
- "Like Odysseus in Book XI of The Odyssey, we will, in a sense, enter Hades to converse with the dead and to discover who we and they are. Like Odysseus, each one of us has to 'sail after knowledge', or else we will be in a state 'knowing less than drugged beasts'"
- "Each youth does not belong to himself, but is public property and a warrior in the cause of liberty"
- "Moral behaviour is not piloted by the intellectual grasp of true propositions, and by adding that where Ryle saw intelligent behaviour as requiring a grasp of an unformalisable knowing-how, I see in moral behaviour a need for unformalisable elements of character and experience"

## Action Items
- Support educational diversity and choice rather than state monopolies
- Advocate for curricula that include the "best that has been thought and known" across disciplines
- Promote character education alongside intellectual development
- Defend parental rights in educational decision-making
- Resist utilitarian approaches that reduce education to economic utility

## Questions to Consider
- What is the proper balance between educational freedom and educational standards?
- How can we ensure all children have access to high-quality education while respecting diversity?
- What role should tradition play in education in a rapidly changing world?
- How can we integrate character formation with intellectual development?
- Who should have ultimate authority over educational decisions—the state, parents, or educators themselves?

## Conclusion
"In Defence of Liberal Education" is a powerful and timely philosophical defence of traditional education against progressive and utilitarian alternatives. O'Hear writes with clarity and conviction, drawing on deep knowledge of both philosophical traditions and current educational debates. While some readers may find his critique of progressive education overly harsh or his advocacy of deregulation questionable, his central argument—that education should initiate students into the great conversations of human culture rather than merely prepare them for employment or citizenship—is compelling and important.

The book is well worth your time if you're concerned about the direction of modern education or interested in the philosophical foundations of educational practice. O'Hear's defence of liberal education speaks directly to current debates about curriculum content, educational freedom, and the purpose of schooling in democratic societies. His warning about "a despotism over the mind" is particularly relevant in an era of increasing ideological conformity and educational standardization. Whether you agree with all his conclusions or not, O'Hear forces readers to confront fundamental questions about what education is for and who should control it—questions that are more urgent now than ever.
