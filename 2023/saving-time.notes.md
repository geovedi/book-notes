# Saving Time
Author: Jenny Odell

## Introduction: A Message for the Meantime

  - Standardization and divisibility are common, but they're also linked to human and ecological exhaustion.
  - Entrainment occurs when adapting one's temporal rhythms to external demands, reflecting hierarchies.
- Experience Economy and Leisure:
  - Travel influencers, like Morris, are key in the experience economy, turning nature into consumable backdrops.

## Whose Time, Whose Money?
- Observations on Fungible Time and Labor:
  - The concept of time as money is deeply ingrained in industrial society.
  - American clocks in the 19th century held an ambiguous position, symbolizing progress and cyclical nature.
  - Mechanical efficiency isn't solely the domain of capitalists; humans have designed labor-saving systems for centuries.
- Taylorism and Mechanical Efficiency:
  - Taylorism, as outlined by Frederick Winslow Taylor, focused on breaking down tasks for maximum efficiency.
  - Scientific management sought to streamline labor processes, leading to intense time measurements and motion studies.
  - Taylorism aimed to concentrate knowledge in employers' hands, de-skilling labor and polarizing different types of time.
- Division of Labor and Time Control:
  - The divide between timed and timer is significant, reflecting the power dynamics between management and workers.
  - Standard time and control have been historically associated, impacting various labor divisions.
  - Capitalism's division of labor has run along gendered and racialized lines, with waged and unwaged work distinctions.
- Content Moderation and Algorithmic Work:
  - Content moderation is a form of cyborg work, requiring both machine-like processing and human empathy.
  - Algorithmic systems often lack the nuance to distinguish complex human behaviors and intentions.
  - Workers in algorithmic roles are subjected to gamification and efficiency metrics, intensifying their labor.
- The Shift Toward Data and Automation:
  - Work is shifting towards data-driven and automated roles, leading to the reconfiguration of labor content, conditions, and geography.
  - The concept of time as fungible labor is upheld by the digital workplace, where productivity takes precedence.
  - The tragedy of fungible labor time involves coercion, exploitation, and the reduction of people to machines.
- Expanding Perspectives on Labor and Time:
  - Overemphasis on fungible time limits understanding of time and labor's complexity.
  - The industrial view of time as money confines individuals to a view of time as private property.
  - The division between "Above the API" jobs (automation) and "Below the API" jobs (human execution) is widening.
- Reflection on Time and Labor:
  - Social media and modern technology consume time, impacting both personal and professional lives.
  - The modern work environment and technology resemble a dystopian cycle, where individuals are absorbed into an algorithmic realm.

## Self Timer
- Burnout and Achievement-Subjects
  - Burnout is not just about work and economic security; even those who are comfortable experience burnout.
  - Byung-Chul Han's concept of "achievement-subjects" explains that the drive to maximize production is deeply ingrained.
  - Achievement-subjects are like self-propelled entrepreneurs who constantly chase productivity and achievement.
  - Excessive work and performance lead to "auto-exploitation" and contribute to burnout.
- The Cycle of Comparison and Competition
  - The societal focus on achievement and success leads to constant comparison and competition.
  - Cultural notions of the good life are influenced by the capitalist "logic of increase."
  - Social media amplifies the cycle of upward social comparison, leading to dissatisfaction and burnout.
  - The pursuit of "better" and "more" becomes relentless due to societal pressure and comparison.

  - Grading systems, like A-F grades, were standardized to serve industrial efficiency and social control.
  - The connection between work measurement and eugenics shows how productivity ideals are deeply rooted.
- The Cult of Busyness and Its Impact
  - The cult of busyness emphasizes constant productivity and achievement.
  - The concept of "busy" becomes synonymous with "good" in a culture that values ceaseless striving.
  - Differentiating between self-timers (privileged) and the timed (less privileged) is important.
  - Solidarity should be fostered among those who recognize the negative impact of this culture.
- The "Lie-Flat" Movement and Privilege
  - The "lie-flat" movement challenges the constant pressure to be productive and successful.
  - Privilege influences who can afford to "lie flat" and who cannot.
  - An understanding of shared consequences and causes can lead to solidarity and positive change.
  - Fortifying "walled gardens" of authenticity can either deepen the status quo or create genuine change.
- Rethinking Expansion and Leisure
  - Rethinking the culture of expansion challenges the notion that more is always better.
  - Choosing to live a life with less ambition doesn't equate to settling for less meaning.
  - The imperative to "live your best life" may actually mean "live the best life" in terms of high achievement.
  - Finding humor and dignity in rejecting the culture of endless expansion can lead to healthier perspectives.
