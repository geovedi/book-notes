## George Washington

George Washington, the first president of the United States, had a deep connection to food and its role in shaping the nation's identity. His plantation, Mount Vernon, served as a hub for agricultural production, where he cultivated tobacco, wheat, corn, and other crops. Washington's culinary preferences and entertaining choices showcased a blend of British and American influences, with dishes like hoecakes and roast beef gracing his table. The central figure in his kitchen was Hercules, an enslaved chef known for his culinary skills and attention to detail.

As a visionary leader, Washington understood the importance of social customs and etiquette in fostering a sense of unity among diverse citizens. He sought to establish a uniquely American set of social rules, insisting on being addressed as "Mr. President" and implementing specific guidelines for official entertaining. While Washington appreciated the art of toasting and raising glasses in celebration, he was not a heavy drinker and preferred wine or beer over hard spirits. Throughout his presidency, he endeavored to create a common identity for the young nation through carefully orchestrated social gatherings and dinners.

Washington's dedication to his country extended to his culinary pursuits. He took an active interest in menu planning and collaborated with his wife, Martha Washington, on selecting dishes. Their esteemed cook, Hercules, played a crucial role in the kitchen, overseeing meal preparations and ensuring high standards of quality and presentation. Despite Washington's admiration for Hercules, he struggled to reconcile his desire to retain the talented chef with the need to prevent slave escapes, ultimately resorting to rotation tactics to maintain control. Hercules eventually seized an opportunity for freedom, escaping from Mount Vernon and leaving behind a legacy as the nation's first celebrated chef.


## John Adams

John Adams, the second president of the United States, had a modest and frugal nature that starkly contrasted with his predecessor, George Washington. Descended from New England Puritans, Adams favored simple New England fare and had a deep-rooted belief in temperance. However, as the president, he had to navigate the expectations of socializing and entertaining the citizens. Adams and his wife, Abigail, found themselves managing the challenges of hosting official events, dealing with the lack of skilled staff, and adapting to the unfinished President's House in Washington, D.C. Their famous housewarming party in 1801 marked the beginning of White House entertaining, but it turned out to be their last significant social event as Adams lost the presidency to Thomas Jefferson in the election of 1800.

The construction of the President's House, later known as the White House, was plagued with challenges, leaving it unfinished by the time John Adams assumed the presidency. The mansion's incomplete state and the nascent social scene in Washington, D.C. added to Adams' sense of isolation and loneliness. His wife, Abigail, eventually joined him and took charge of making the mansion habitable. As the First Lady, Abigail hosted numerous official gatherings, accommodating the citizens' expectations while dealing with the constraints of an unfinished and ill-equipped residence. The Adamses' contributions and the furnishings provided by Congress transformed the President's House into a temporary home for the First Family, setting the precedent for future administrations.

The Adamses' personal preferences and New England roots influenced their entertaining style. They preferred plain New England cuisine, serving dishes like Indian pudding and hearty meats and vegetables. While their meals may not have been gourmet, the Adamses understood the importance of fulfilling their social obligations. Abigail, in particular, took on the responsibility of hosting numerous lunches, drawing rooms, and "great dinners" for congressmen and other guests. However, the opulence and leisurely parties of their southern colleagues, who were accustomed to plantation abundance, stood in stark contrast to the Adamses' modest gatherings. Despite their reservations and financial concerns, the Adamses recognized the significance of hosting an official opening reception at the President's House, and their New Year's Day party in 1801 marked a momentous occasion, inaugurating entertaining at the White House.


## Thomas Jefferson

Thomas Jefferson, a complex figure in American history, played a pivotal role in shaping the nation while grappling with contradictory views on slavery and freedom. From his time in Paris as a diplomat to his presidency and life at Monticello, Jefferson's legacy intertwines with the stories of the Hemings family, particularly Sally Hemings. Rumors of a sexual relationship between Jefferson and Sally Hemings, a young slave girl, have been supported by DNA evidence, confirming that they had six children together. Jefferson's views on slavery and his treatment of the Hemings family reflect a contradictory mix of principles, personal desires, and the harsh realities of his time.

Jefferson's impact extended beyond politics and slavery; he was also an avid gastronome and farmer. His love for food and wine shaped his pursuits, and he used his gardens at Monticello to experiment with diverse crops from around the world. Jefferson's passion for wine led him to advocate for lighter varietals and lower tariffs on imported wines, highlighting his belief that food and drink were essential components of a civilized society. Today, Monticello honors Jefferson's gastronomic legacy, with efforts to provide a more fitting culinary experience for visitors, reflecting his commitment to agriculture, biodiversity, and community building through food.

The complex intertwining of Thomas Jefferson's personal and political life, his relationships with the Hemings family, and his passion for food and wine continue to captivate and challenge our understanding of the Founding Father. As we grapple with the contradictions and legacies of historical figures, Jefferson's story serves as a reminder that even great men are shaped by the context of their time. Monticello stands as a testament to his agricultural experiments and the contributions of enslaved individuals, while ongoing efforts to reevaluate and contextualize Jefferson's life shed light on the complexities of our nation's history.

## James Madison

James Madison, America's fourth president and the "Father of the Constitution," shared a unique partnership with his wife, Dolley Madison. While Madison was known for his intellectual prowess and political contributions, it was Dolley who emerged as a charismatic and influential figure, essentially shaping the role of the First Lady. Dolley's natural talent for hosting and her ability to bridge political divides through social grace and strategic patronage played a significant role in bolstering Madison's leadership and solidifying the importance of the Executive Mansion as a center of power in Washington, D.C. Despite her outward charm and formidable social skills, Dolley maintained a studied neutrality and was skilled at maintaining alliances and diffusing tensions, earning her widespread admiration and the title of the "only permanent power in Washington."

Dolley's influence extended to the dining room, where she orchestrated grand entertaining at the Madison White House. Known for her ability to remember names and faces, Dolley created a welcoming and inclusive atmosphere at her Wednesday night drawing rooms, where people from all walks of life were invited to gather. With the help of skilled French stewards and a team of servants, she served elaborate meals prepared in a blend of Anglo-French-Virginia style, showcasing special and regional dishes. Dolley's knack for carving ham or turkey and her fondness for unique desserts, such as apricot and pink peppermint ice cream, added to the allure of these grand occasions. The Madisons' Wednesday night gatherings became so popular and politically significant that they were referred to as "Mrs. Madison's Wednesday nights" or "squeezes."

Despite her public persona, Dolley Madison remained enigmatic and nonpartisan, skillfully navigating the tumultuous political landscape of the time. She used her exceptional social tact and relentless equanimity to win over critics and unite adversaries. Her talent for mediating conflicts and her secret weaponâ€”a pinch of snuff from her silver snuffboxâ€”helped diffuse tensions and secure alliances. Dolley's unwavering kindness and inclusivity left a lasting impact, reinforcing her husband's leadership and shaping the role of the First Lady as a political force.

## Abraham Lincoln

Abraham Lincoln, the 16th President of the United States, led a complex and eventful life marked by triumphs and tragedies. His presidency coincided with the turbulent era of the American Civil War, and his actions played a significant role in shaping the nation's history. Lincoln's wife, Mary Todd Lincoln, often faced criticism but also showcased her social judgment during their time in the White House. Tragedy struck the family when their son Willie fell ill and passed away, leaving Mary devastated. Despite the challenges and heartbreak they endured, Abraham Lincoln's legacy lives on as a pivotal figure in American history.

In addition to his presidential responsibilities, Abraham Lincoln played a part in establishing Thanksgiving as a national holiday. Recognizing the need for unity and national reconciliation, Lincoln proclaimed a national "Day of Thanksgiving" to be celebrated on the final Thursday of November. The holiday, championed by Sarah Josepha Hale, editor of Godey's Lady's Book, gradually gained acceptance and became a symbol of communal feasting and gratitude in America. Thanksgiving continues to be a cherished celebration, promoting fellowship and serving as a reminder of the country's better nature.

However, Abraham Lincoln's life was not without tragedy. On the fateful night of April 14, 1865, while attending a performance at Ford's Theatre, Lincoln was assassinated by John Wilkes Booth. Mary Lincoln, who was present during the assassination, was profoundly affected by the traumatic event. Lincoln's death shocked the nation, and his body was displayed in the East Room of the White House before being laid to rest. His untimely demise marked the end of a tumultuous era and left a lasting impact on the nation's collective memory.

Despite these challenges, Grant remained dedicated to his country and was successful in negotiating important trade agreements, such as the Reciprocity Treaty with Hawaii. Furthermore, his wife, Julia Grant, played a significant role in establishing the White House as a venue for extravagant state dinners, including the memorable dinner hosted for the king of the Sandwich Islands.

Grant's personal battle with alcoholism plagued him throughout his life. He had experienced multiple episodes of excessive drinking, both during his military career and later as President. Grant made efforts to stay sober, seeking support from pastors and friends, joining temperance unions, and enduring long periods without drinking. However, occasional relapses into alcohol abuse continued to haunt him. Despite his struggles, Grant accomplished remarkable feats, such as leading the Union Army to victory in the American Civil War.

The Grants' family life also had its share of memorable moments. The wedding of their daughter Nellie in 1874 at the White House captivated the public's attention. The lavish ceremony, attended by 250 guests, featured a sumptuous breakfast in the State Dining Room, where guests indulged in a feast of various delectable courses. Unfortunately, Nellie's marriage to Algernon Charles Frederick Sartoris ended in heartbreak, overshadowing the joy of the wedding.

## Barack Obama

This chapter delves into the influence of food and nutrition during Barack Obama's presidency, focusing on the personal and political aspects of his and Michelle Obama's relationship with food. It explores how their experiences shaped their food policies and initiatives while in the White House.

The chapter begins by emphasizing Anthony Bourdain's belief that food is inherently political, as it encompasses issues of access, origin, ingredients, and societal implications. The Obamas' food policies were deeply rooted in their personal struggles and choices. Michelle Obama's experiences with miscarriage and marriage counseling, coupled with their busy schedules, led to unhealthy eating habits for their family.

Upon realizing the negative impact of their dietary choices, Michelle Obama connected with Sam Kass, a freelance cook who advocated for fresh, healthy ingredients. Despite initial reservations, the Obamas hired Kass to prepare nutritious meals for their family. Michelle's commitment to healthy eating extended to the larger public, and she used her position as First Lady to raise awareness about childhood obesity and nutrition.

The chapter highlights the establishment of the White House Kitchen Garden, spearheaded by Michelle Obama. This garden served as a symbol of the importance of fresh, homegrown ingredients and promoted conversations about food choices and their impact on health. The garden's success inspired similar initiatives and brought attention to the need for healthier eating habits.

While Michelle focused on nutrition and healthy eating, Barack Obama tackled broader food policy issues. However, his attempts to reform the food system faced significant opposition from powerful agricultural and food industry interests. Despite some achievements, such as improved nutritional standards for school lunches and increased funding for regional food projects, Obama's efforts to enact substantial change were often thwarted.

The chapter highlights the differences between Michelle and Barack Obama's approaches. Michelle's initiatives garnered public support, while Barack's attempts at comprehensive food policy reform faced more significant challenges. The chapter concludes by acknowledging the lasting impact of Michelle's White House garden and the importance of the Obamas' efforts to bring attention to healthy eating and food issues during their time in office.

## Donald Trump

The chapter on Donald Trump explores his relationship with food, his eating habits, and the impact of his presidency on the food industry and public health. It delves into his love for fast food, his preference for well-done steaks, and his fondness for drowning his steak in ketchup. Trump's food choices reflect his aversion to risk and his unwillingness to trust expertise outside of his own.

The chapter highlights how Trump's diet, characterized by abstinence followed by indulgence in unhealthy fast food, contributed to a cycle of instant satisfaction and subsequent health issues. It discusses the addictive nature of sugar and salt and the negative consequences of consuming excessive amounts of these additives.

Furthermore, the chapter examines the implications of Trump's unhealthy eating habits on public health. A survey suggests that his fast-food diet influenced Americans, both Republicans and Democrats, to view fast food as a socially acceptable meal option. This, in turn, could have detrimental effects on public health.

The chapter also contrasts Trump's dietary choices with those of his wife, Melania Trump, who maintained a healthier eating pattern and emphasized the importance of balance and indulging cravings in moderation. Melania's approach to food served as a counterbalance to her husband's habits.

Despite the scaled-back celebrations, Biden took office with a promise of "renewal and resolve" and emphasized his commitment to being a president for all Americans.

The chapter explores Biden's personal relationship with food and his middlebrow palate, contrasting it with the extravagant fast-food binges of his predecessor. Biden's love for ice cream becomes a defining characteristic, and his declaration, "My name is Joe Biden, and I love ice cream," resonates with the public. While not a cook himself, Biden's wife, Dr. Jill Biden, is an accomplished cook who uses food as a means of communication and bonding with family.

The chapter also delves into the challenges and expectations Biden faces regarding the American food system. The impacts of the previous administration's policies, such as cuts to agricultural programs and the relocation of scientific research agencies, are discussed.
