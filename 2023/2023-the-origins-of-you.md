# The Origins of You
**Authors**: Vienna Pharaon | **Year**: 2023

## Summary
"The Origins of You" is a groundbreaking guide to understanding how our family patterns shape our adult relationships and how we can break free from destructive cycles. As a licensed marriage and family therapist, Vienna Pharaon introduces the concept of "origin healing work" - an approach that reveals how unresolved pain and trauma from our family of origin continues to influence our present-day behavior, choices, and relationship patterns.

This book is essential for anyone who finds themselves repeatedly stuck in the same relationship patterns, struggles with intimacy, or wonders why they can't maintain healthy connections despite their best intentions. Readers will gain a practical framework for identifying their core wounds, understanding their origins, and developing the tools needed to create lasting change in how they love and live.

## Core Insights

### The Five Core Wounds That Shape Us
Pharaon identifies five fundamental wounds that originate in our family systems and continue to impact our adult relationships. Each wound represents an unmet need from childhood that we spend our lives trying to heal, often through maladaptive patterns that perpetuate our pain rather than resolve it.

> "I have yet to meet a person who doesn't have some kind of origin wound. In this book, we'll explore five that are common."

**Quick Take**: Recognizing which wounds resonate with you is the first step toward healing. Most people identify with more than one wound, but typically one or two dominate their relationship patterns.

### Your Past Is Your Present Until You Heal It
The book introduces "origin healing work" - an integration of family systems work and psychodynamic theory that helps us see how our present-day behavior connects to the family systems in which we grew up. Our current relationship struggles are rarely about our current partner; they're about unresolved pain from our past being activated in the present.

> "The majority of the relationship difficulties that individuals or couples come to me with are due to lingering and unresolved pain and trauma from past relationships, especially within their family of origin."

**Quick Take**: Stop trying to fix your current relationships without understanding their origins. The same patterns will continue until you address the root cause.

### The Worthiness Wound: "I Want to Feel Worthy"
This wound manifests as a deep-seated belief that you're fundamentally flawed, unlovable, or not good enough. It often stems from inconsistent parenting, conditional love, criticism, or neglect. As adults, this shows up as people-pleasing, perfectionism, or settling for relationships that reinforce your unworthiness.

The exercise "I'm unworthy because..." reveals how these beliefs are learned rather than innate. Children aren't born believing they're unworthy - they're taught these beliefs through their experiences and relationships.

> "You are not born unworthy, so what is it that happens between birth and this moment that makes you question it?"

**Apply This**: Challenge your worthlessness stories by tracing them back to their origin. Ask yourself: Who first taught me this message about myself? What evidence do I have that it's actually true?

### The Belonging Wound: "I Want to Belong"
This wound stems from experiences of exclusion, rejection, or being forced to choose between authenticity and acceptance. It creates a lifelong struggle between wanting to be yourself while desperately needing to fit in. As adults, this manifests as codependency, losing yourself in relationships, or rejecting parts of yourself to gain acceptance.

The healing journey involves learning that true belonging doesn't require betraying your authenticity. You can belong without sacrificing who you are.

> "Every child, every human, craves to be a part of something. We want to be ourselves and yet be part of that which is greater than ourselves. We want to belong."

**Apply This**: Identify where you're betraying your authenticity to belong. Practice small acts of staying true to yourself even when it feels uncomfortable.

### The Prioritization Wound: "I Want to Be Prioritized"
This wound originates from experiences where you weren't made to feel important, valued, or chosen by caregivers or significant figures. As adults, this manifests as an intense fear of abandonment, difficulty prioritizing yourself, or staying in relationships where you're consistently devalued.

People with this wound often become hyper-attuned to signs that they're not prioritized, and may overcompensate by being overly accommodating or demanding constant reassurance.

**Apply This**: Practice prioritizing yourself first. Notice when you're abandoning your own needs to maintain connections, and experiment with putting your needs first.

### The Trust Wound: "I Want to Trust"
This wound develops through experiences of inconsistency, betrayal, lies, or abandonment. It creates a fundamental inability to believe that others will be there for you, tell the truth, or have your best interests at heart. As adults, this manifests as hypervigilance, difficulty being vulnerable, or pushing people away before they can hurt you.

> "Trust can be ruptured through inconsistency, lies, betrayal, and abandonment. And as we know, once trust is lost, it can feel nearly impossible to regain it and trust again."

**Apply This**: Start building trust with safe people through small vulnerabilities. Track who consistently follows through on their commitments, and practice letting your guard down incrementally.

### The Safety Wound: "I Want to Feel Safe"
This wound stems from physical, emotional, or psychological unsafe environments in childhood. It creates a baseline of anxiety, hyper-vigilance, and difficulty relaxing in relationships. As adults, this manifests as controlling behavior, difficulty with intimacy, or constantly scanning for threats.

The author shares her own origin story of hiding in a closet with her mother during a family rupture, illustrating how these early moments of terror can become lifelong patterns.

**Apply This**: Identify what makes you feel safe in relationships and communicate these needs clearly. Create environments and relationships where safety is explicitly discussed and prioritized.

### Breaking Patterns Through New Behaviors
The book's final sections focus on practical tools for changing ingrained patterns. This includes learning healthy conflict skills, developing authentic communication, establishing boundaries, and creating consistency in new behaviors.

The key insight is that awareness alone isn't enough - you must practice new behaviors consistently until they become automatic. This often means tolerating the discomfort of change while your brain and body adjust to new ways of relating.

**Apply This**: Choose one pattern to change and practice the new behavior daily. Track your progress and celebrate small wins rather than demanding perfection.
