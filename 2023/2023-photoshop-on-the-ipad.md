## Core Insights

### The Mobile Creative Revolution
Photoshop on iPad represents a fundamental shift in how creatives work, offering the same powerful engine as desktop Photoshop but with an interface redesigned for touch interaction. The app maintains full compatibility with desktop files through Creative Cloud synchronization, enabling seamless transitions between devices. This mobility doesn't compromise functionality—it enhances creativity by making photo editing more accessible and experimental in any environment.

> "Creating photo compositions, selecting, masking, retouching and painting are very intuitive on the iPad. The touchscreen combined with this custom Photoshop interface sometimes feels like you're modeling."
**Quick Take**: The iPad version isn't a stripped-down mobile app—it's Photoshop reimagined for touch, making professional photo editing possible anywhere from your couch to a car journey.

### Essential App Ecosystem
The book reveals that Photoshop on iPad reaches its full potential when combined with Adobe's mobile ecosystem. Lightroom Mobile handles initial photo edits and raw processing, Fresco provides advanced drawing and painting capabilities, and Adobe Capture creates custom brushes and color themes. This integration transforms the iPad into a complete creative workstation where each app specializes in what it does best.

> "The combination with mobile apps like Lightroom, Fresco and Illustrator turns your iPad into a fantastic graphics workstation."
**Quick Take**: Download Photoshop plus Lightroom Mobile and Creative Cloud apps immediately—this trio forms the foundation of professional mobile photo editing.

### Professional Artist Workflows
The book features interviews with four accomplished artists who reveal their iPad Photoshop workflows. Ted Chin creates surreal photo compositions during travels, Russell Brown restores old photos with precision retouching, Frankie Cihi designs social media murals, and Magdiel Lopez crafts striking graphic designs. Each artist demonstrates different approaches: some use iPad as their primary workspace, others as a supplement to desktop workflows, and all value the intuitive nature of touch-based editing.

> "I traveled a lot. On those trips I only had my iPad with me and did all my work on it in the car on the way."
**Quick Take**: The iPad isn't just for casual editing—professionals use it for client work and artistic creation, proving its capability for serious creative projects.

### Hardware and Subscription Strategy
The book provides clear guidance on optimal hardware and subscription choices. While Photoshop works on any current iPad, the ideal setup combines an iPad Pro (11-inch or 12.9-inch) with Apple Pencil 2 for professional work. For subscriptions, the Photography plan ($10/month) offers the best value, including both desktop and iPad versions of Photoshop and Lightroom plus substantial cloud storage.

> "The configuration Adobe recommends for Photoshop is the iPad Pro with the 12.9-inch screen and the Apple Pencil 2."
**Quick Take**: Start with the Photography plan—it's affordable and includes everything needed for professional photo editing across all your devices.

### Practical Project-Based Learning
The book emphasizes hands-on learning through specific projects: photo compositing with Ted Chin's techniques, vintage photo restoration with Russell Brown's methods, social media banner creation with Frankie Cihi's approach, and graphic design principles from Magdiel Lopez. Each project teaches fundamental Photoshop skills (layers, masks, selections, adjustments) within real-world creative contexts, making the learning process immediately applicable.

> "Doing is the best way to learn! I combined those interviews with fun tutorials so you could see and learn for yourself how to create beautiful things in Photoshop."
**Quick Take**: Skip theoretical chapters and jump directly to project tutorials—you'll learn more effectively by creating actual photo compositions.
