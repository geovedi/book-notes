- Markers of Genuine Emergency Mode
  - Spend What It Takes to Win:
     - In emergencies, governments abandon austerity and spend significantly.
     - World War II and COVID-19 emergencies saw substantial increases in government spending.
     - Climate action spending is disproportionately low compared to the scale of the crisis.
  - Create New Economic Institutions:
     - During past emergencies, new economic entities were established to address urgent needs.
     - Public corporations were formed to produce war-related goods during World War II and support programs during the COVID-19 pandemic.
     - A similar approach is needed for manufacturing climate-related technologies.
  - Shift from Voluntary to Mandatory Measures:
     - Emergencies necessitate mandatory actions, not just voluntary and incentive-based policies.
     - While rationing and restrictions were imposed during wartime and the pandemic, climate policies have remained largely voluntary.
     - Clear and mandated measures are required to drive significant emissions reductions.
  - Tell the Truth about the Crisis Severity:
     - Effective emergencies involve transparent communication about the crisis's severity.
     - Leaders during World War II communicated honestly and inspired hope.
     - Climate action messages lack consistency, and actions such as approving fossil fuel infrastructure contradict emergency claims.
- Ensuring Justice and Equality in Mobilization
