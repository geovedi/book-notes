## HACKING 101
### What Is Hacking?
- Definition of hacking as exploiting vulnerabilities in systems for desired outcomes.
- Hacks occur within systems where participants agree to common rules (legal, social, or organizational).
- Hacks take advantage of loopholes or unanticipated consequences in systems.
- Different types of hackers: creative hackers who discover vulnerabilities, individuals using exploits, and beneficiaries of hacking activities.
- Influence of wealth and power on hacking; resources enable effective exploitation.
- Vulnerabilities exist in all systems; hacking is a natural outcome of systems thinking.
- Creativity and problem-solving skills of hackers in circumventing system limitations.
- Examples of hacking in various domains: online games, school systems, phone networks, societal norms.
- Systems need resilience and resistance to hacking but not necessarily imperviousness.
- Complex systems with many rules are more vulnerable; systems with flexible social norms are easily exploited.
- Trust, good intentions, and systems of arbitration and adjudication are crucial for maintaining system functionality.

### Hacking Systems
- Vulnerabilities exist in all systems, regardless of their security level.
- Hacking involves exploiting these vulnerabilities through various means, known as exploits.
- Examples of hacking in different domains: computer systems, legal and financial systems.
- Different roles in hacking: creative hackers who discover vulnerabilities and develop exploits, others who use exploits for hacking, and organizations or individuals orchestrating hacking activities.
- Systems react to hacks by patching or mitigating vulnerabilities.
- Technical systems are often patched promptly, while social systems may require lengthy legislative changes.
- If a vulnerability is not patched, the hack can become integrated into the system's rules and norms.
- Not all systems are equally hackable; complex systems with numerous rules and flexible social norms are particularly vulnerable.
- Hacking can drive innovation and uncover flaws within systems, but it also poses risks.
- Balancing system resilience with the potential for creative exploration and improvement is essential.

### What Is a System?
- Definition of a system: a collection of interconnected elements working together to achieve a common purpose or produce desired outcomes.
- Systems exist in various domains: technology, society, nature, cognitive processes, etc.
- Systems are governed by rules: explicit or implicit, formal or informal, dictating behavior and interactions of components.
- Rules can take the form of laws, regulations, social norms, or natural laws.
- Systems produce outcomes: tangible or intangible, real or virtual, resulting from processes guided by rules.
- Examples of outcomes: creation of a physical book, operation of a word processor, etc.
- Hacking within systems: exploiting rules and vulnerabilities to achieve desired outcomes not intended by designers.
- Hacks can occur in technical systems (software) or social systems (when rules don't prohibit).
- Systems can be intentional or emergent: designed by individuals or shaped over time through social processes and norms.

### The Hacking Life Cycle
- Hacking process consists of vulnerabilities and exploits.
- Vulnerability: Flaw or oversight in a system allowing a hack to occur.
- Exploit: Mechanism or technique to take advantage of the vulnerability and achieve the desired outcome.
- Examples of vulnerabilities and exploits: EternalBlue exploit, Double Irish tax loophole, door lock vulnerability.
- Roles in a hack:
 - Creative hackers: Discover vulnerabilities and develop exploits.
 - Hackers who deploy exploits in practice.
 - Organizations or individuals benefiting from the hack and potentially orchestrating it.
- Access to resources (technical expertise, wealth, power) crucial for successful hacking.
- Discovery and dissemination of hacks:
 - Hacks may remain limited or spread widely based on various factors.
 - Timeframe for discovery and system patching varies.

### The Ubiquity of Hacking
- Hacking is prevalent due to inherent vulnerabilities in all systems.
- Parallels drawn to GÃ¶del's mathematical proof, demonstrating the existence of vulnerabilities and exploitable aspects in all systems.
- Examples of hacking in various contexts:
 - Children bypassing restrictions in online games and educational systems.
 - Historical examples like foldering by General Petraeus, Paul Manafort, and 9/11 terrorists.
 - Phone system hacks, including making collect calls for information transmission.
 - Modern-day instances like manipulating app reviews and using connectivity issues in remote learning.
- COVID-19 pandemic and remote learning brought new examples of hacking in educational platforms.
- Complex systems with numerous rules are more susceptible to hacking due to unintended consequences.
- Less critical, smaller-scale, and experimental systems may be more tolerant of hacking, offering opportunities for evolution and improvement.

- Types of hidden provisions include earmarks (specific allocations of funds for pet projects), riders (additional provisions unrelated to the main purpose of the legislation), and omnibus bills (covering multiple policy areas within a single piece of legislation).
- Motivations for including hidden provisions may involve political bargaining, appeasing special interest groups, or advancing ideological agendas.
- Some hidden provisions may serve legitimate purposes, while others can subvert the democratic process by slipping unrelated policies or favors into bills without scrutiny.
- Identifying and addressing hidden provisions pose challenges, necessitating public awareness, media scrutiny, and comprehensive review processes for transparency and accountability.
- The role of interest groups, lobbyists, and political maneuvering can influence the insertion of hidden provisions in legislation.

### Must-Pass Legislation
- Must-pass legislation addresses urgent matters with critical consequences if not enacted into law.
- These bills may involve national security, disaster relief, economic crises, or government funding.
- Must-pass legislation becomes a vehicle for negotiation and compromise, advancing political agendas.
- Lawmakers face pressure to support these bills to avoid negative perceptions or consequences for their constituents.
- Ethical concerns include the risk of attaching unrelated provisions or "riders" to these bills for personal gain.
- Limited debate and scrutiny can lead to rushed decision-making and unintended consequences.
- Public opinion and media coverage play a role in shaping the outcome of must-pass legislation.

### Delegating and Delaying Legislation
- Delegation involves transferring decision-making power from the legislative branch to executive agencies or other entities.
- Reasons for delegation include dealing with complex issues and utilizing specialized expertise.
- Drawbacks of excessive delegation include concentration of power, lack of transparency, and reduced accountability.
- Delaying legislation is intentionally postponing action on certain bills or issues.
- Reasons for delaying legislation include political maneuvering and attempts to gather more information or support.
- Negative consequences of delay include perpetuation of problems, public frustration, and loss of public trust.
- Delegation and delay can impact democratic governance, with concerns about legislative power and potential executive overreach.
- Public opinion and interest groups play a role in influencing the use of delegation and delay tactics.

### The Context of a Hack
- Hacks are interconnected with existing systems and rely on vulnerabilities within the context they occur.
- The context of a hack involves considering the social, political, and economic conditions in which it takes place.
- Different contexts for hacks include financial systems, political processes, social networks, and legal frameworks.

- Administrative burdens, such as complex registration processes and limited polling places, create obstacles for marginalized communities in election participation.
- Gerrymandering is a form of hacking voting eligibility, manipulating district boundaries to influence election outcomes and consolidate political power.
- Independent commissions are advocated to draw district boundaries fairly and minimize partisan influence.
- Money in politics can influence information, choice, and agency in elections, necessitating campaign finance reform to address the unequal distribution of political influence.
