    - Venue Clause and Vicinage Clause state that crimes should be tried in the state and district where committed.
    - The District of Wyoming encompasses Yellowstone National Park, which extends into Montana and Idaho.
    - The conundrum arises when crimes occur in the Idaho portion, where no residents live.
- Native Lands and Legal Vulnerability:
    - Non-Native individuals who commit crimes on Native lands often evade prosecution.
    - Tribal courts lack jurisdiction over non-Native offenders.
    - This leads to a lack of consequences for non-Native perpetrators, particularly in cases of assaulting Native women.
- Federal Enclaves and Legal Loopholes:
    - Federal enclaves are areas within a state owned by the federal government.
    - State and local laws often don't apply to federal enclaves.
    - Various patches have been attempted, such as applying state taxes and allowing enclave residents to vote in state elections.
- Legal Hacks in Practice:
    - Examples include using the federal enclave status to escape state laws, like foie gras bans.
    - A San Francisco restaurant exploited federal enclave status to avoid California's foie gras ban.
    - These anecdotes reveal the need for legislative fixes to close legal vulnerabilities.

    - Regulations serve important purposes but can hinder innovation and benefit incumbents.
- Vulnerabilities and Industry Responses:
    - New companies find vulnerabilities in regulations and construct hacks that comply on the surface but violate the intent.
    - Addressing regulatory hacking requires proactive measures by regulators and anticipation of industry responses.
- Ensuring Effective Regulation:
    - Red-teaming new regulations before enactment helps identify potential vulnerabilities and responses.
    - Regulators should be agile and monitor regulated parties to promptly address post-regulation innovations and vulnerabilities.

### Jurisdictional Interactions
- Tax Loopholes Exploiting Jurisdictional Limits:
    - Companies like Cisco, Pfizer, Merck, and Facebook used tax loopholes (Double Irish with a Dutch Sandwich) to avoid paying US taxes.
    - These tactics involve foreign subsidiaries and income transfers to avoid global tax obligations.
    - Corporate tax avoidance costs the US nearly $200 billion annually and worldwide between $500 and $600 billion.
- Complexity of Jurisdictional Tax Avoidance:
    - Tax avoidance hacks exploit vulnerabilities across multiple countries' laws.
    - State Combined Reporting Systems (CRS) help prevent multi-jurisdictional profit shifting.
    - CRS requires reporting total domestic profits and the portion of business within a specific jurisdiction.
- Shortcomings of Current Approaches:
    - Most US states using CRS don't require disclosure of offshore profits.
    - US corporate taxes not assessed on foreign-earned profits facilitate avoidance and profit shifting.
- Solution: Mandatory Worldwide Combined Reporting (MWCR):
    - MWCR aims for transparency and simplicity in resolving complex jurisdictional taxation issues.
    - Similar to CRS, companies and subsidiaries report worldwide profits and their business percentage in each jurisdiction.
    - Biden administration and OECD working on similar proposals to prevent multinational profit shifting.
- Exploiting Subverted Laws for Gain:
    - Countries subvert their laws to attract global clients, creating jurisdictional arbitrage.

    - Delaware's favorable tax laws and "Delaware Loophole" attract corporations to incorporate there.
- Corporate Strategies and Hacks:
    - Hacks stem from exploiting favorable jurisdictional rules.
    - Delaware's tax laws and flags of convenience show how states leverage jurisdictional arbitrage.
- Challenges in Regulating Corporations:
    - Regulatory structures for global corporations are inadequate, and they profit from jurisdictional arbitrage.
    - Big tech companies operate globally while regulations remain national, creating regulatory mismatches.

### Administrative Burdens
- Necessity and Adaptation:
    - Administrative burdens are a way of hacking social benefits systems like unemployment insurance or Medicaid.
    - Opponents of these policies employ creative strategies due to political constraints.
- Purposeful Design of Administrative Burdens:
    - Administrative burdens are intentionally imposed to make accessing benefits difficult.
    - Florida's unemployment insurance system designed to be challenging to access.
    - Online application system is faulty, with errors and crashes, and specific access hours.
    - Millions of COVID-19 unemployed Floridians faced difficulties submitting claims.
- Deliberate Benefit Denial:
    - Administrative burdens create passive-aggressive benefit denial.
    - People who should qualify for benefits give up due to excessive hurdles.
    - This tactic was seen in US abortion policies where states made abortion access extremely difficult despite its legal status.
- Complexity of Benefit Systems:
    - Benefit systems aim to minimize two types of errors: undeserving recipients and deserving recipients being denied.
    - Balance between the two outcomes depends on political preferences.
    - Administrative burden exacerbates this by making the application process so complex that many deserving people give up.
- Effects on Eligibility and Access:
    - Administrative burdens disproportionately affect the average citizen, especially those lacking skills, resources, and time.
    - Programs like Women, Infants, and Children (WIC), food stamps, and Medicaid experience similar hacking.
    - Arkansas's Medicaid work requirement led to people losing benefits due to associated paperwork.
- Challenges and Potential Solutions:
    - Addressing administrative burdens is challenging due to their creation by political authorities.
    - Independent benchmarks or system audits by external organizations could quantify and visualize the impact, influencing legislative action.

### Hacking Common Law
- Complexity and Iteration in Systems:

    - Built into common law's design, it allows for interpretation and adaptation.
    - Entick's case in 1762 demonstrated how common law can be iteratively hacked to expand individual rights.
- Hack and Interpretation of Rules:
    - Hacks involve challenging and subverting a system's rules, often relying on interpretations.
    - Interpretations of rules can change over time and contribute to evolving the system.
    - Entick's case hacked trespass law by interpreting it in a way that protected individual rights.
- Beneficial Hacks and Social Contract:
    - Some hacks, while violating existing norms, can benefit the social contract.
    - Entick's case enhanced civil liberties without undermining the overall social order.
    - If a hack aligns with the social contract's spirit, it can be absorbed as beneficial innovation.
- Common Law Mechanism:
    - Common law operates through iterative adjudicated hacks.
    - Courts reconcile various interpretations and precedents to apply new hacks as they emerge.
    - Rules of common law are complex, evolving, and added by different actors over time.
- Flexibility of Common Law:
    - Common law is derived from judicial decisions and legal precedents.
    - Unlike statutory law, it can evolve over time as judges apply past precedents to new circumstances.
    - Common law's evolution involves a series of adjudicated hacks.
- Examples of Hacking in Legal Systems:
    - Patent law is based on statutory law but often relies on judge-made rules.
    - Patent injunctions used as an anticompetition hack were patched by the US Supreme Court in 2006.
- Patch and Evolution in Law:
    - Laws are incomplete and susceptible to hacks due to changing circumstances.
    - Hacks challenge existing laws, creating either vulnerabilities or advantages.
    - Courts act as neutral arbiters to determine whether hacks are legitimate or illegitimate.
- Adapting Land Ownership During the Middle Ages:
    - During the Middle Ages, landowners transferred property titles to trusted individuals while fighting in the Crusades.
    - The transfer often led to disputes upon the owner's return, highlighting a hack of the law.
    - Court of Chancery introduced the concept of equitable ownership to address this issue.
- Legacy of Common Law and Equitable Ownership:
    - Equitable ownership division introduced in response to the hack persists in modern common law countries.
    - In the US, this division is reflected in the distinction between law and equity.

### Hacking as Evolution
- Orthodox Jewish Hacking of Religious Rules:
    - Orthodox Jews creatively hack religious rules to adapt to modern times.
    - Examples include using timers for devices, integrating keys into jewelry, and establishing eruv boundaries.
    - Non-Jews have different rules, creating distinctions in how rules are hacked.
    - Observant Jews sometimes phrase requests indirectly to work around prohibitions.
- Hacking as Evolution and Adaptation:
    - Hacking is a process of finding novel failure modes and exploiting them.
    - Successful hacks bring unexpected outcomes, changing and evolving systems.
    - Hacking is both positive evolution through system incorporation and destructive exploitation of flaws.
- Innovation, Evolution, and Revolution:
    - Innovation is vital for system survival; ossified systems struggle to evolve.
    - Conservative resistance to change can lead to system breakdown.
    - Hacking serves as a tool for the weak to instigate social change, sometimes leading to revolutions.
- Hacking Corporate Personhood and Social Evolution:
    - Hacking is used to challenge corporate personhood and grant rights to nature or animals.
    - The concept of corporate personhood itself is a hack.
    - Those in power often decide which hacks remain, influencing the course of social evolution.
- Importance of Ethical Focus in Social Hacking:
    - The future of social hacking should prioritize the greater good to prevent system breakdown.
    - Focusing on ethical evolution prevents perpetuating injustices.
- Metaphor of Hacking as an Invasive Species:
    - Hacks can be compared to invasive species introduced to a new environment.
    - Invasive species exploit differences in their new environment, sometimes leading to ecosystem collapse.
    - Similarly, hacks can introduce abrupt changes in systems, potentially leading to catastrophic outcomes.

## Hacking Political Systems

### Hidden Provisions in Legislation
- Supply Chain Attacks and Legislative Hacking: A Parallel
  - Russian SVR's SolarWinds hack exploited a software update, granting access to thousands of networks.
  - Similar concept applies to legislative process: hidden vulnerabilities inserted into pending legislation.
  - Supply chain attacks target systems via indirect means, affecting multiple entities simultaneously.
- Examples of Legislative Hacks
  - Instances of concealed provisions in laws for specific benefits or industries.
  - Lobbyists engineer hidden outcomes, influencing laws through strategic wording.
  - Examples: Starbucks lobbying for coffee roasting to count as domestic manufacturing; antitrust exemptions for certain industries.
- Complexity Enables Exploitation
  - Bills are lengthy, intricate, and contain numerous provisions.
  - Hidden provisions inserted unnoticed due to their complexity and lawmakers' limited scrutiny.
  - Exploit lies in slipping in provisions that legislators fail to notice.
- Centralization of Power and Opaque Processes
  - Centralization of power within party leaders leads to less transparent legislative processes.
  - Larger bills pass with less scrutiny, providing opportunities for hidden provisions.
  - Hidden provisions exploit lawmakers' lack of time and attention to details.
- Proposed Solutions: Enhancing Transparency and Detection
  - Suggested solution: Mandate review time proportional to bill length.
  - Media scrutiny and public awareness uncover hidden provisions, fostering change.
  - Proposed legislative "Track Changes" system for better visibility of modifications.
  - Implementation challenges due to secrecy and intentional crafting of loopholes.
- Incentives for Detection and Detection Methods
  - Bug bounty-like rewards for citizens discovering vulnerabilities in legislation.
  - Red-teaming exercises to simulate hacking and reveal hidden provisions.
  - Complexity arises when determining if a vulnerability is a bug or a feature.
- Challenges and Future Prospects
  - Bills often pass quickly, preventing thorough review.
  - Potential for AI to detect vulnerabilities before enactment.
  - AI detection introduces new challenges alongside benefits.

### Must-Pass Legislation
- Introduction: Must-Pass Legislation as Targets for Hacks
  - Bills like appropriations and responses to crises are considered must-pass legislation.
  - Lawmakers attach non-germane policy changes as "riders" to must-pass bills.
  - Riders allow passage of unpopular provisions under the cover of vital legislation.
- Examples of Rider Exploitation
  - Historical cases of riders added to must-pass bills for policy changes.
  - Examples include the Boland Amendment, FDA regulations on cigars, and intellectual property copyright bills.
  - Exploitation hinges on the president's inability to veto individual line items.
- Rider Exploitation Mechanisms
  - Presidents can only veto entire bills, not specific line items.
  - Committees can add riders before full legislature approval, sometimes secretly.
  - Efforts to curb rider use, like the line-item veto power, have often failed.
- Strengthening Legislation Structure: Single-Subject Laws
  - Suggestion for legislation to address only one primary issue, akin to modular code structure.
  - Proposal for the One Subject at a Time Act, which hasn't passed in Congress.
  - Some state constitutions require single-subject legislation, but interpretations vary.
- Challenges in Defining Single Subjects
  - Challenge in defining what constitutes a single subject.
  - Divergent interpretations: some argue any bill could be subdivided, others that any subjects can be related.
- System Resilience as a Defense
  - Must-pass legislation is susceptible due to dire consequences of non-passage.
  - Government shutdowns due to non-passage of appropriations are avoidable with good policy.
  - Suggestion for automatic continuing resolutions to maintain government funding at comparable levels.

### Delegating and Delaying Legislation
- Introduction: Legislative Hacks to Address Complex Issues
  - After the Cold War, Congress struggled to close military bases due to political concerns.
  - Base Realignment and Closure Commission formed to make closure decisions, reducing political fallout.
  - Legislative hacks like these help address complex issues while avoiding direct responsibility.
- Base Realignment and Closure Commission: Depoliticizing Base Closures
  - Creation of external commission to decide base closures or scaling back.
  - Recommendations automatically take effect unless Congress intervenes.
