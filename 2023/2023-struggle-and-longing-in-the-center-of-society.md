# Struggle and Longing in the Center of Society
**Original Title**: Kampf und Sehnsucht in der Mitte der Gesellschaft
**Author**: Stephan Anpalagan | **Year**: 2023
**Category**: Fiction & Literature 

## Summary

This powerful social analysis examines the exclusive nature of Germany's "middle of society" - the privileged center that defines belonging while excluding those with migration backgrounds or poverty histories. Anpalagan, a journalist and theologian born in Sri Lanka and raised in Germany, explores how this "middle" has become both the pivot point and battleground in a polarized society. Through personal reflection, historical analysis, and contemporary case studies, he reveals how Germany's struggle with immigration, identity, and belonging reflects a broader global crisis of inclusion versus exclusion.

The book is essential reading for anyone seeking to understand modern Germany's social divisions, the complexities of migration and integration, and how societies create insiders and outsiders. It offers profound insights for policymakers, social workers, and citizens grappling with questions of national identity in an increasingly diverse world.

## Core Insights

### The Exclusive Middle: Germany's Social Divide

Germany's "middle of society" represents an exclusive club that determines who belongs to the national "we." As Anpalagan writes, "Die Mitte der Gesellschaft ist ein exklusiver Ort: Sie ist das »Wir« in »Wir sind das Volk« und das »Du« in »Du bist Deutschland«." (The middle of society is an exclusive place: it is the "we" in "We are the people" and the "you" in "You are Germany.")

This middle offers homeland to "normal" citizens while remaining inaccessible to those with poverty records or migration histories - often for generations. Those who belong to this privileged center not only determine their own fate but also control the margins: left and right, top and bottom, inside and outside. The book reveals how this social stratification creates a permanent underclass of "others" who can never fully belong, regardless of their contributions or length of residence.

### The Guest Worker Paradox: "We Called for Workers, People Came"

The book opens with the famous Max Frisch quote that encapsulates Germany's immigration dilemma: "Wir riefen Arbeitskräfte, es kamen Menschen." (We called for workers, people came.) Through the story of Hüseyin Yılmaz, the 1,000,001st guest worker, Anpalagan illustrates how Germany invited foreign labor while never expecting these workers to become fellow citizens.

This paradox reveals Germany's fundamental ambivalence toward immigration. The country needed workers for its economic miracle but never truly prepared for these workers to stay, bring families, and become permanent members of society. This created what Anpalagan calls "Schrödingers Ausländer" - the immigrant who simultaneously invades social systems while stealing German jobs, existing only in the imagination of right-wing conservatives.

### The Integration Trap: Moving Goalposts of Belonging

Germany has created what Anpalagan calls an "integration trap" - a system where the goalposts for belonging constantly shift. When immigrants master the language, they're told they need better jobs. When they get jobs, they're told they need to adopt German culture. When they adopt cultural norms, they're told they'll never be "real" Germans anyway.

This creates an impossible situation where integration is defined not by objective criteria but by subjective feelings of the majority. As one study cited in the book reveals, Muslim social advancement actually generates resistance in the population, especially when they enter values-oriented professions like mayor, police officer, judge, or teacher. The argument becomes they cannot culturally envision how Germany should be.

### The "Leitkultur" Debate: Cultural Purity as Social Control

The German debate around "Leitkultur" (leading culture) emerges as a tool for social control rather than genuine cultural preservation. Anpalagan exposes how these discussions about German culture, values, and traditions serve primarily to exclude migrants from the center of society.

The book analyzes absurd examples, like the CDU's demand for "pork meat duty" in kindergartens and public cafeterias, revealing how cultural arguments mask exclusionary politics. When transparency about integration requirements would actually enable migrants to succeed, those pushing Leitkultur deliberately keep requirements vague to maintain permanent exclusion.

### Structural Discrimination: The Invisible Barriers

Through extensive research and studies, Anpalagan documents the pervasive structural discrimination that keeps migrants marginalized:

- Children with foreign-sounding names receive worse grades from teachers for identical work
- Job applicants with "foreign" names need 4.5 times more applications than those with German names
- Women wearing headscarves face 7.6 times more discrimination for accounting positions
- Housing applicants with "foreign" names receive 31-46% fewer responses in competitive markets

This discrimination isn't random prejudice but systematic barriers that maintain social hierarchy. As Anpalagan notes, those who depend on the "foreigner" as a distraction from their own failures cannot use integrated migrants as success stories.

2. How does your country's immigration history create similar paradoxes between economic need and social exclusion?
3. Where do you see the "moving goalposts" of integration in your own community?
4. How can societies balance cultural preservation with genuine inclusion?
5. What does it mean to love one's country "with a broken heart"?
6. How does structural discrimination perpetuate inequality even without explicit prejudice?
7. Who benefits from maintaining social divisions along lines of origin and identity?

## Conclusion

This book is absolutely worth your time for its profound analysis of how modern societies create and maintain exclusion. Anpalagan's unique position as both insider and outsider gives him unprecedented insight into Germany's struggle with diversity and belonging. The biggest reason to read this book is its masterful weaving of personal narrative, historical analysis, and contemporary social science that reveals how exclusion operates not just through individual prejudice but through systemic structures and cultural narratives.

The book's greatest strength lies in exposing how liberal democracies can maintain exclusionary practices while preserving their self-image as inclusive societies. Anpalagan demonstrates how debates about culture, values, and integration often serve as coded language for maintaining social hierarchies. His concept of the "integration trap" provides a powerful framework for understanding why many integration initiatives fail to create genuine inclusion.

For anyone seeking to understand modern social divisions, this book offers both diagnostic clarity and a path toward more authentic inclusion. It challenges readers to examine their own assumptions about belonging and consider how societies might move from managing diversity to embracing it as a source of collective strength.
