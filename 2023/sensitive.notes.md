## Sensitivity: Stigma or Superpower?
- Introduction:
  - Anne's story illustrates the power of sensitivity, where her intuition helped save a patient's life.
  - Sensitive people possess unique strengths that benefit the human species as a whole.
- The Deep-Processing Sensitive Brain:
  - Sensitive brains process input deeply and extensively, focusing on details and complexities.
  - Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) reveals differences in brain activity between sensitive and less-sensitive individuals.
  - Sensitive individuals exhibit greater activation in areas related to visual processing and detail evaluation.
  - Sensitivity leads to ongoing, deep processing even after the initial experience has ended.
- High Intelligence Meets High Empathy:
  - Sensitivity reflects a deep processing capacity, manifesting in both intelligence and empathy.
  - Research shows a correlation between giftedness and sensitivity, particularly in highly intelligent individuals.
  - Musicians, artists, scientists, and business leaders benefit from sensitivity's deep processing and empathetic awareness.
- What Sensitivity Is Not:
  - Sensitivity should not be confused with introversion, autism, sensory processing disorder, or trauma.

  - Autistic and sensitive brains process emotional and social cues differently.
  - Sensory processing disorder and sensitivity both involve sensitivity to stimuli, but the former impairs functioning.
