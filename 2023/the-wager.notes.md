### The Docket
- Bulkeley's Detention and Arrest:
  - Bulkeley reads about the court-martial summons in a newspaper and is informed of a warrant for his detention.
  - He pretends to be a relative to inquire about the fate of the castaways who reached Brazil.
  - Bulkeley's true identity is revealed, and he is taken into custody along with other officers from the Wager.
  - They are transported to Portsmouth and confined on HMS Prince George.
- Impending Court-Martial and Legal Challenges:
  - Officers and crew of the Wager are summoned for a court-martial to face charges related to their actions during the expedition.
  - Eighteenth-century British naval law is flexible but often rigid in enforcing discipline.
  - The case against them involves multiple serious violations of naval regulations, including mutiny, quarreling, and running away.
  - Accusations of attempted murder and homicide further complicate the situation.
  - Legalistic documents and omissions in the accounts of the castaways contribute to the complexity of the trial.
- Purpose and Impact of Naval Court-Martial:
  - Naval court-martials serve to maintain discipline and uphold the power of the state.
  - The system aims to set examples through severe punishments to deter future violations.
  - An example from the mutiny on HMS Bounty underscores the gravity and public nature of naval executions.

  - The trial includes officers and crew members from the Wager who must defend themselves, but they can seek legal advice and cross-examine witnesses.
- Limited Scope of Trial and Testimonies:
  - The trial focuses solely on the wreck of the Wager, not broader charges like mutiny or murder.
  - Captain David Cheap is questioned first and accuses only Lieutenant Baynes of neglect in informing him about sighting land.
  - Baynes is the only one accused and is reprimanded, while all others, including Cheap, are cleared of wrongdoing regarding the shipwreck.
- Bureaucratic Justification and Hidden Motivations:
  - The trial ends without addressing the more serious allegations of mutiny and murder.
  - The Admiralty and British authorities avoid a proper trial, relying on a bureaucratic escape clause related to wages after shipwrecks.
  - The focus on bureaucratic reasoning obscures the truth and avoids exposing brutal actions and misconduct during the expedition.
  - The British Empire's desire to maintain a facade of superiority, especially during times of war and calamities, contributes to the decision to downplay the trial's outcomes.
- War of Jenkins' Ear and Imperial Motivations:
  - The War of Jenkins' Ear, which prompted the Wager expedition, is rooted in ulterior motives beyond the attack on Jenkins' ear.
  - British merchants sought to expand trade, colonial holdings, and monopolies through a pretext of war.
  - The wider imperial struggle known as the War of the Austrian Succession further shapes the geopolitical landscape.
  - Despite the calamities and dreadful losses of the war, the British government is preoccupied with maintaining public support and empire-building.
- The Nature of Mutinies and Concealing Truth:
  - Mutinies, especially during wartime, can be suppressed or downplayed to maintain order and official narratives.
  - Examples from history, such as the French mutinies during World War I, show how such incidents can be hidden or mischaracterized.
  - The official inquiry into the Wager affair is closed, Cheap's deposition vanishes, and the true nature of the upheaval on Wager Island is concealed.
