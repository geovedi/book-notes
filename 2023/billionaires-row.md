The chapter opens with a series of lawsuits and allegations that surface, revealing the deep-seated conflicts and mistrust between the two partners.

### Not a Good Look
In the chapter "Not a Good Look," the narrative delves into the challenges and setbacks faced by real estate developer Gary Barnett and his company, Extell Development, as they grapple with the changing dynamics of the luxury real estate market.

The chapter begins by highlighting Barnett's efforts to generate excitement and interest in Central Park Tower, a high-profile luxury residential project. With construction nearing completion and COVID-19 cases declining in the city, Extell's sales team organizes parties, events, and open houses to attract potential buyers. The goal is to achieve enough sales to pay off the project's construction loan by the end of the year.

However, the chapter reveals the financial strains faced by Extell and Barnett. The company experienced losses of $190 million in 2020, and profit expectations for Central Park Tower had to be significantly revised downward. Rising construction costs and a reduction in prices contributed to a more than 60 percent downgrade in projected gross profits. Extell now aims to sell all the units by the end of 2023 at lower prices compared to initial forecasts.

Despite the challenges, the luxury real estate market shows signs of recovery. The chapter highlights the surge in wealth among the super-rich, fueled by central bank stimulus and the rise of cryptocurrencies and NFTs. This newfound wealth creates opportunities for luxury real estate developers, as wealthy individuals seek investment opportunities.

While the market experiences a resurgence, buyers are hesitant to pay pre-pandemic prices, leading developers like Barnett to adjust pricing strategies to remain competitive. At Central Park Tower, Extell closes units at significant discounts compared to the original offering prices. This reflects the oversupply challenge faced by luxury high-rise developers, compounded by the additional inventory accumulated during the pandemic.

The chapter contrasts the varying fortunes of different luxury developments. While Central Park Tower and Barnett's original Billionaires' Row project, One57, face pricing adjustments and resale losses, 220 Central Park South maintains its value and achieves impressive deals. The market recovery is primarily driven by domestic buyers, and the return of foreign buyers is anticipated to further boost the market.

The chapter takes a closer look at the city's temporary shutdown, the challenges faced by developers and brokers, and the subsequent pause in real estate activity.

The chapter begins by describing the dramatic impact of the pandemic on the city, leading to a virtual halt in daily life and business operations.

Despite the limitations imposed by the pandemic, some brokers managed to find opportunities and close deals.

Furthermore, the chapter examines the broader economic impact of the pandemic on New York City. The temporary exodus of wealthy residents and the decline in tourism further strained the luxury real estate market.

However, as construction progresses, both developers encounter a myriad of obstacles. Barnett faces financial challenges, with Extell experiencing significant losses in 2020, revising profit expectations, and struggling to meet construction loan deadlines. The project's costs have increased, and the projected sales prices have been lowered, making it crucial for Extell to generate sufficient sales to pay off the loans.

The focus is on the Central Park Tower, where a celebratory event is held to mark the hundredth birthday of Manhattan fashion icon Iris Apfel. The event is part of Extell's efforts to generate excitement and promote the building as construction nears completion.

Gary Barnett, the developer behind Central Park Tower, faces financial challenges after Extell saw losses of $190 million in 2020.

Barnett's goal is to generate enough sales to pay off the construction loan's balance by the end of the year.

The chapter highlights the shift in market conditions, with the injection of trillions into the economy and the rise of cryptocurrency and NFTs. The pandemic leads to a wealth creation event for a small segment of the global population, resulting in a surge in stock market values and the net worths of billionaires. This newfound wealth, combined with optimism surrounding the COVID vaccine trials and the end of political uncertainty, fuels the recovery of the luxury real estate market.

While demand starts to return, buyers are not willing to pay pre-pandemic prices. Developers, including Extell, adjust pricing to attract buyers and reduce inventory. Central Park Tower units are sold at significant discounts, with the goal of paying down loans and potentially raising prices later.

The chapter also highlights the resilience of certain properties, such as 220 Central Park South, which maintains its value and attracts high-profile buyers. The luxury market's recovery is attributed primarily to domestic activity, and the chapter speculates on the potential impact of foreign buyers returning to the market.


### Resentment
In the chapter "Resentment," the focus shifts to the auction of the Macklowe collection, highlighting the personal and financial implications for Harry Macklowe, a prominent real estate developer. The centerpiece of the auction is Alberto Giacometti's sculpture, "Le Nez," which holds great significance for Macklowe.

The chapter delves into Macklowe's emotional connection to the artwork, as he vividly recalls seeing it for the first time in his youth. The sculpture carries deep meaning for him, and he insists on acquiring it when it becomes available for sale. However, the auction becomes a symbol of the aftermath of his divorce from Linda Macklowe, as their shared art collection is being sold off.

The auction itself is a high-profile event, with live bidding and remote participation from around the world. The sculpture ultimately sells for $78.4 million to Justin Sun, the creator of the cryptocurrency Tron. This sale reflects the growing influence of cryptocurrency and NFTs in the art market.

While the auction brings in record-breaking proceeds of $922 million, insiders reveal that Macklowe's share of the funds does not go directly into his pocket. He has pledged a portion of the proceeds to Fortress Investment Group, as he had borrowed money from them for a Midtown East development project that didn't materialize.

Macklowe's demeanor during the auction is described as somber, and he expresses bitterness about the financial outcomes of his divorce. He reflects on his role as a provider and the wealth his ex-wife and son have gained, while he feels resentful and dissatisfied.
