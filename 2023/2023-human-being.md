# Human Being: A Practical Guide to Reclaiming Our Fundamental Skills in a Digital Age
**Authors**: Graham Lee | **Year**: 2023

## Summary
"Human Being" explores how modern technology is eroding twelve fundamental human capabilities that have defined our species for millennia. Graham Lee argues that as we outsource more of our cognitive and physical abilities to digital devices, we risk losing the very essence of what makes us human. Drawing from historical examples across different cultures and time periods, the book demonstrates how extraordinary human skills—once commonplace—are now degrading due to our increasing reliance on technology.

This book is essential for anyone concerned about maintaining human agency and capability in an age of AI and digital dependency. Readers will gain practical strategies to reclaim and strengthen their innate human abilities while still benefiting from modern technology.

## Core Insights

### Navigation: The Lost Art of Finding Our Way
The book opens with the extraordinary story of Tupaia, a Polynesian navigator who guided Captain Cook through the Pacific Ocean using traditional wayfinding techniques. Polynesian navigators could read ocean swells, cloud formations, star patterns, and subtle environmental signs to traverse thousands of kilometers without instruments. They combined egocentric (self-centered) and allocentric (outward-focused) perspectives, using their "Etak" system—a dynamic mental map that tracked islands relative to fixed points.

> "Finding our way back home to a hotel in an unknown city, we might do the same, counting streets crossed, or looking out for a colourful building we recall. But more often these days, we rely on our phones to tell us where we are."

**Quick Take**: GPS technology may be convenient, but it severs our connection to place and degrades our innate spatial abilities. Practice navigating without devices to rebuild your mental mapping skills.

### Physical Movement: Rediscovering Our Athletic Heritage
Lee documents how indigenous populations in North America possessed remarkable physical capabilities, covering vast distances on foot that seem extraordinary today. Before modern transportation, humans regularly walked and ran significant distances as part of daily life. The book emphasizes that our bodies evolved for movement, not sedentary screen time.

> "When you run for a sufficiently long distance and allow yourself to become immersed in the experience, you find yourself settling deeply into the landscape and becoming part of it."

**Quick Take**: Regular walking and running not only improve physical health but also enhance our connection to the natural world and our own embodied experience.

### Conversation: The Art of Face-to-Face Communication
The book explores how 17th and 18th century coffeehouses became centers of intellectual exchange and social innovation. Unlike today's cafes where people sit alone with screens, these spaces fostered lively debate, collaboration, and the exchange of ideas through rich, face-to-face conversation. Darwin's research on facial expressions and body language revealed how deeply these non-verbal cues are embedded in our evolutionary heritage.

> "Our facial expressions of emotion seem globally consistent – indeed, this is backed up by numerous recent studies of literate and preliterate cultures."

**Quick Take**: Digital communication cannot replicate the full richness of in-person conversation. Prioritize face-to-face interactions to maintain your social intelligence and empathetic abilities.

### Artistic Observation: Learning to See Again
Lee discusses how artists like Alice Neel developed extraordinary observational skills through their drawing practice. The act of drawing forces you to move beyond cursory glances and truly understand what you're seeing. This skill extends beyond art—it enhances your ability to perceive details and understand your environment more fully.

> "Artists typically continue their work until the very end of their life... An art practice, more than anything else, provides for a vigorous rhythm of life experience, full of variety and complexity."

**Quick Take**: Even simple sketching exercises can dramatically improve your observational skills and help you break free from passive consumption of digital content.

### Craftsmanship: The Value of Making Things with Your Hands
The story of George Daniels, who single-handedly revived the art of handmade watchmaking, illustrates the profound satisfaction of mastering complex physical skills. Daniels taught himself thirty-four distinct crafts to create extraordinary timepieces by hand. This section emphasizes how working with your hands connects you to tradition and provides a sense of accomplishment that digital work often lacks.

> "Minute, interlocking components move together, each triggering the next in a train of actions. There is a fixed, precise orderliness as the individual functions of wheels, cogs and screws coalesce into a unity."

**Quick Take**: Learning a physical craft provides unique satisfaction and develops skills that digital experiences cannot replicate.

### Critical Thinking: Navigating the Information Age
Lee addresses how modern technology affects our thinking processes, introducing the concept of "extended cognition"—how our thinking extends into digital tools. The book provides frameworks for developing metacognition (thinking about your thinking) and maintaining intellectual independence in an age of algorithmic manipulation.

> "The better you are at questioning your own reasoning and prejudices, and at properly interrogating whatever you encounter, the more competent you can become at noticing the implicit assumptions that exist in arguments."

**Quick Take**: Regularly examine your thought processes and biases to maintain cognitive independence from digital influences.

### Memory: Preserving Our Mental Archives
The book explores how our spatial memory systems evolved to help early humans navigate and survive. Lee demonstrates how modern navigation technology is weakening our natural memory abilities and provides techniques for strengthening mental mapping and recall.

> "The spatial nature of your memory means it responds readily to use: the more you pay attention on your travels and work out a route for yourself, the more detailed the personal cognitive maps you grow in response."

**Quick Take**: Challenge yourself to navigate without GPS and practice memorization exercises to keep your spatial memory sharp.

## Best Quotes

- "What does it mean to be human? Our genetics distinguish us from other species, of course, and the evolution of our bodies and brains have been key to our survival. But I would argue that it is our activities, attributes and skills, rather than our mere physical apparatus, that characterize our humanness."

- "Technology can of course be helpful – after all, there are lots of tasks we would rather not have to do. But when we rely on our devices to support our core abilities – essential skills we have acquired such as reading or writing, or fundamental capabilities such as memory, navigation or social skills – these can quickly begin to degrade over time."

- "To be fully human is something worth fighting for, and fortunately, unlike most of the other pressing issues of our time, we as individuals have the agency to do this in our everyday lives, starting from today."

- "When technologies begin superseding our active moments and lessen the calls we make on our natural abilities, we risk diminishing the scope of that being."

- "Human beings are hardwired to master and hone new skills; to learn what we are truly capable of, we just have to get started."

## Action Items

- **Practice device-free navigation**: Try finding new routes in your neighborhood without GPS to rebuild your spatial memory and mental mapping abilities.

- **Incorporate more physical movement**: Replace short car journeys with walking, take stairs instead of elevators, and consider a standing desk to reduce sedentary time.

- **Prioritize face-to-face conversations**: Arrange regular in-person meetings with friends and colleagues, and practice active listening without digital distractions.

- **Develop observational skills**: Spend five minutes daily sketching your surroundings to improve your ability to notice details and see the world more deeply.

- **Learn a physical craft**: Take up a hands-on hobby like woodworking, knitting, or repair work to develop manual skills and tactile intelligence.

- **Practice metacognition**: Regularly examine your own thought processes and question how digital technology might be influencing your thinking patterns.

- **Create digital boundaries**: Set specific times for checking devices and create tech-free zones in your home to maintain presence and focus.

## Questions to Consider

- Which of your fundamental human abilities have you noticed weakening due to technology use?
