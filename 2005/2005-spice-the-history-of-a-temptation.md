# Spice: The History of a Temptation
**Authors**: Jack Turner | **Year**: 2005

## Summary
"Spice: The History of a Temptation" explores the profound and often paradoxical relationship between humanity and spices throughout history. Turner reveals that the quest for spices was far more than a culinary endeavor—it was a driving force behind exploration, empire-building, medicine, religion, and even sexuality. The book challenges the modern assumption that medieval Europeans simply used spices to mask the taste of rotten food, revealing instead a complex web of cultural, medical, magical, and erotic associations that made these aromatic substances the most coveted commodities on Earth for thousands of years.

This book will appeal to history enthusiasts, food lovers, and anyone fascinated by how seemingly simple commodities can shape human destiny. Readers will gain a deeper understanding of how sensory desires drove global exploration, how spices influenced everything from religious rituals to sexual practices, and why these aromatic substances held such power over the human imagination across millennia.

## Core Insights

### The Spice Race: Exploration's True Motivation
The Age of Discovery wasn't primarily about finding new lands or spreading Christianity—it was driven by Europe's insatiable appetite for spices. Columbus, Vasco da Gama, and Magellan were essentially spice hunters on a global scale. The quest for pepper, cinnamon, cloves, and nutmeg launched ships across oceans and established the first truly global trade networks. Turner reveals that when Columbus promised "pearls, spices and gold beyond anything ever imagined," spices weren't an afterthought—they were a primary objective that reshaped the world map and established the foundations of modern globalization.

> "For the sake of spices, fortunes were made and lost, empires built and destroyed, and even a new world discovered."

**Quick Take**: The spice trade was the original globalization, creating the first sustained connection between East and West and establishing patterns of international commerce that persist today.

### Beyond Culinary: Spices as Medicine and Magic
Spices served as powerful medicines long before they became culinary flavorings. Medieval physicians prescribed cinnamon for digestive ailments, cloves for pain relief, and nutmeg as an aphrodisiac. The line between kitchen and pharmacy was virtually nonexistent—spices were believed to balance the body's humors, ward off plague, and even protect against evil spirits. Turner shows how spice merchants and apothecaries were often the same people, and how the same aromatic powders might season dinner and cure disease in the same household.

> "Besides adding flavor to a dry and salty piece of beef or relieving the fishy tedium of Lent, spices were put to such diverse purposes as summoning gods and dispelling demons, driving off illness or warding against pestilence."

**Quick Take**: The modern separation between food and medicine would have seemed alien to our ancestors, for whom every meal was potentially therapeutic and every spice a possible cure.

### Erotic Aromas: Spices and Sensuality
The association between spices and sexuality spans millennia, from the Song of Songs' mention of "nard and saffron, calamus and cinnamon" to modern television's "Spice" channel. Turner documents how spices served as aphrodisiacs across cultures, with ginger reputed to "rekindle waning desire" and nutmeg claimed to make "a small penis splendid." The erotic associations weren't merely metaphorical—spices were integral to medieval and Renaissance love potions, wedding celebrations, and even prostitution. Their exotic origins and intense aromas made them natural symbols of forbidden pleasure and sensual delight.

> "Spices have an ancient aphrodisiac reputation, of which the word's sexual overtones are but the faint, figurative residue."

**Quick Take**: The connection between spice and sex reveals how deeply sensory experiences shape human desire, with aromas serving as powerful triggers for attraction and intimacy.

### Religious Significance: Sacred Scents
Spices played crucial roles in religious rituals across faith traditions. Frankincense and myrrh featured prominently in Christian ceremonies, while spice boxes remain central to Jewish Havdalah rituals. Turner explores how aromatic substances were believed to bridge the gap between mortal and divine, with their rising smoke carrying prayers to heaven. The "odor of sanctity" associated with saints and holy people often carried spicy undertones, linking spiritual purity with aromatic purity. Conversely, some religious reformers viewed spices as symbols of worldly excess and moral corruption.

**Quick Take**: The human tendency to associate elevated spiritual states with elevated aromas shows how our sensory experiences shape our conceptions of the divine.

### Social Status: The Politics of Pepper
Spice consumption became a powerful marker of social hierarchy. Medieval nobles displayed their wealth through lavish use of expensive spices, while peasants could rarely afford them. Turner documents how spice consumption became so tied to social status that sumptuary laws regulated who could use which spices and in what quantities. The ability to serve heavily spiced food at banquets was as much a status symbol as serving fine wine today. This social signaling function helped explain why demand persisted even when culinary fashions changed.

**Quick Take**: Luxury consumption has always been about social signaling as much as utility, with spices serving as perfect portable displays of wealth and refinement.

- How do our current food preferences reflect social status, health beliefs, and cultural values in ways we might not recognize?
- What sensory experiences (smell, taste, touch) do we undervalue in understanding human motivation and behavior?

## Conclusion
"Spice: The History of a Temptation" is absolutely worth your time, particularly if you're fascinated by how sensory desires shape human history. Turner's achievement is to reveal that the spice trade wasn't really about trade—it was about the complex web of human desires, fears, beliefs, and aspirations that these aromatic substances came to represent. The book's greatest strength is its ability to connect the intimate sensory experience of taste and smell with the grand sweep of global history, showing how personal appetites can become world-changing forces.

The biggest reason to read this book is its fundamental challenge to materialistic explanations of human behavior. Turner demonstrates that the quest for spices can't be explained by simple utility or economic logic—it requires understanding the human capacity for symbolic thinking, sensory experience, and cultural meaning-making. In an age that often reduces human motivation to purely rational or material factors, this book reminds us that we are creatures of sensation, imagination, and desire, capable of launching ships across oceans for the taste of pepper or the scent of cinnamon.

Masterfully written and exhaustively researched, "Spice" transforms a seemingly narrow topic into a profound meditation on human nature itself. It reveals that the most powerful forces in history often operate through our senses and emotions rather than through logical calculation—a lesson as relevant today as it was in the age of sail.
