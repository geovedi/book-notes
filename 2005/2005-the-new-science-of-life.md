# The New Science of Life
**Authors**: Rupert Sheldrake | **Year**: 2005

## Summary
Rupert Sheldrake's "A New Science of Life" presents a revolutionary challenge to conventional biological science by proposing the hypothesis of formative causation. The book argues that nature is not governed by eternal, unchanging laws but is instead habitual - that all living organisms, crystals, and even molecules draw upon and contribute to a collective memory of their species through a process called morphic resonance.

This groundbreaking work suggests that the regularities of nature evolve within the universe rather than being imposed from transcendent realms. Sheldrake contends that memory is inherent in nature and transmitted through morphic fields, providing a new framework for understanding biological form, evolution, inheritance, and behavior that goes beyond the limitations of mechanistic and genetic determinism.

The book is essential reading for scientists, philosophers, and anyone interested in the fundamental questions of life, evolution, and consciousness. It offers a compelling alternative to materialistic reductionism and provides a framework that could help bridge the gap between physical and biological sciences.

## Core Insights

### The Hypothesis of Formative Causation
Sheldrake's central thesis is that nature is habitual rather than law-governed. All animals and plants draw upon and contribute to a collective memory of their species. This challenges the conventional scientific assumption that nature is governed by eternal, immutable laws that transcend time and space.

> "This book is about the hypothesis of formative causation, which proposes that nature is habitual. All animals and plants draw upon and contribute to a collective memory of their species. Crystals and molecules also follow the habits of their kind."

**Quick Take**: The universe evolves its own regularities through a cumulative process, rather than following pre-existing eternal laws.

### Morphic Resonance and Morphic Fields
The mechanism for formative causation is morphic resonance - a process by which patterns and habits are transmitted through time and space without energy transfer. These patterns are organized by morphic fields, which are hypothetical fields that shape the development and behavior of systems.

Morphic resonance works on the principle that similar things influence each other across space and time, with the strength of resonance depending on similarity and the number of previous instances. This explains how newly discovered behaviors or forms can spread rapidly through populations.

**Quick Take**: Nature has its own internet-like memory system that stores and transmits organizational information through resonance patterns.

### The Limitations of Genetic Determinism
Sheldrake presents compelling evidence that genes alone cannot explain biological form and inheritance. The Human Genome Project revealed that humans have only about 25,000 genes - surprisingly few compared to simpler organisms, and far fewer than the predicted 100,000+.

This "gene shortfall" problem is compounded by the discovery that homeobox genes, which control body plan development, are remarkably similar across widely different species (flies, mice, humans). The genetic similarities cannot explain the vast differences in form and behavior.

**Quick Take**: Genes are more like a parts list than a complete blueprint - they provide components but don't explain how organisms assemble themselves into specific forms.

### The Big Bang Problem for Eternal Laws
Sheldrake highlights a fundamental contradiction in modern science: cosmology accepts that the universe began 15 billion years ago with the Big Bang, yet biology and physics still operate as if nature is governed by eternal laws that existed before the universe itself.

He questions why we should assume that all the Laws of Nature were present at the instant of the Big Bang "like a cosmic Napoleonic code." This leads to his famous quote that "Modern science is based on the principle: 'Give us one free miracle and we'll explain the rest.'"

**Quick Take**: If the universe had a beginning, then its organizing principles must also have evolved rather than existing eternally.

### Epigenetics and the Return of Lamarckian Inheritance
The book anticipates the recent revolution in epigenetics, which has shown that acquired characteristics can indeed be inherited. This represents a partial rehabilitation of Lamarckian ideas that were rejected by neo-Darwinism.

Sheldrake argues that habits acquired by individual organisms can be inherited through morphic resonance, providing a mechanism for the inheritance of acquired characteristics that operates alongside genetic inheritance.

**Quick Take**: Nature has multiple inheritance systems - genetic, epigenetic, and morphic - working together to transmit information across generations.

## Best Quotes

- "This hypothesis is radically different from the conventional assumption that nature is governed by eternal laws. But I believe that the idea of the habits of nature will have to be considered sooner or later, whether we like it or not."

- "The regularities of nature are not imposed on nature from a transcendent realm, but evolve within the universe. What happens depends on what has happened before. Memory is inherent in nature."

- "Where we most expect to find variation, we find conservation, a lack of change." (On the surprising similarity of developmental genes across different species)

- "The sudden appearance of all the Laws of Nature is as untestable as Platonic metaphysics or theology. Why should we assume that all the Laws of Nature were already present at the instant of the Big Bang, like a cosmic Napoleonic code?"

## Action Items

- **Question Assumptions**: Examine whether your field of work or study operates on unexamined assumptions about "eternal laws" that may have evolved over time.

- **Look for Patterns**: Pay attention to how habits and patterns form and spread in your own life and work - this may provide personal insights into morphic resonance.

- **Multiple Inheritance Systems**: Consider how knowledge and habits are transmitted in your organization through multiple channels beyond formal documentation.

- **Embrace Uncertainty**: Be open to paradigms that challenge conventional thinking, especially those that better explain observed phenomena.

## Questions to Consider

- If the universe had a beginning, is it logical to assume its organizing principles existed eternally before it?

- How might the concept of collective species memory explain phenomena in your field that cannot be accounted for by individual learning alone?

- What if the "laws of nature" are actually habits that have become established through repetition over cosmic time?

- How would our understanding of evolution change if inherited habits complemented genetic inheritance?

## Conclusion
"A New Science of Life" is worth your time if you're interested in fundamental questions about how nature organizes itself. While controversial, Sheldrake's hypothesis provides a coherent framework that addresses many puzzles left unanswered by conventional mechanistic biology.

The biggest reason to read this book is its challenge to the materialistic paradigm that dominates modern science. Whether or not you accept his morphic resonance hypothesis, Sheldrake effectively demonstrates the limitations of current scientific assumptions and opens up new possibilities for understanding life, evolution, and consciousness.

This work represents a bold attempt to restore a sense of mystery, creativity, and inherent memory to nature - qualities that have been largely eliminated from mainstream science. For anyone willing to question fundamental assumptions and explore alternative paradigms, this book offers a compelling and thought-provoking journey.
