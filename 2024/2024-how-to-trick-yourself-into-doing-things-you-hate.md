# How to Trick Yourself Into Doing Things You Hate
**Authors**: Peter Hollins | **Year**: 2024

## Summary
This book reveals the counterintuitive truth about taking action: you don't need motivation to start—action creates motivation. Peter Hollins dismantles the myth that we must feel inspired or ready to tackle difficult tasks, instead offering practical psychological strategies to overcome procrastination, fear, and self-doubt. The core premise is that developing a "bias for action" is a trainable skill that anyone can cultivate, regardless of their current habits or mindset.

Perfect for chronic procrastinators, perfectionists, or anyone stuck in analysis paralysis, this book provides a roadmap for transforming avoidance into achievement. Readers will learn to distinguish between productive planning and destructive rumination, leverage neuroscience-based techniques for building momentum, and create sustainable systems for long-term discipline and growth.

## Core Insights

### Develop a Bias for Action
A bias for action means choosing action over inaction when given any choice. Instead of waiting for the perfect moment, complete information, or sufficient motivation, action-oriented people ask: "What can I do right now?" This mindset shift transforms action from the final step of planning into the necessary first step of every process.

Amazon even lists "bias for action" as a core leadership principle because they've discovered that erring on the side of action almost always brings greater rewards. The key insight is that most decisions are reversible, and the cost of inaction (missed opportunities, wasted time) often exceeds the cost of making mistakes.

> "Life is hard. It's busy, the really cool stuff can seem scary and unobtainable, and keeping your head above water can sometimes feel like an achievement in itself."

**Quick Take**: Start small, act immediately, and adjust course as needed rather than planning perfectly before beginning.

### The 37 Percent Rule
Decision-making paralysis often stems from believing we need complete information before acting. The 37 Percent Rule provides a practical framework: gather only 37% of available information before taking action. This approach minimizes risk while maintaining decisiveness, preventing endless research that never leads to execution.

When you don't know the total amount of available information, aim for about 70% of what you think you need, then act despite remaining uncertainties. While you're stuck gathering more data, you could have acted, failed, learned, and refined your approach multiple times.

> "While you're stuck gathering more and more data, you could have acted, failed, come back to the drawing board, and refined your position—perhaps many times over."

**Quick Take**: Set time limits for research and information gathering, then commit to action with incomplete data.

### Action Creates Motivation (Not Vice Versa)
One of the most self-limiting beliefs is that action requires enthusiasm or motivation. The reality is exactly opposite: taking action creates the momentum and enthusiasm that fuels further action. Motivation isn't a firecracker that starts projects with a bang—it's a fire maintained through consistent, everyday actions.

When you don't "feel like it," that's precisely when action matters most. Small achievements create mini-rewards that build momentum for larger efforts. The solution to feeling unmotivated isn't to wait for inspiration—it's to take immediate action, however small.

> "If you make excitement and enjoyment a condition for acting, then you teach yourself to passively wait for better days and to instantly give up when things are a little challenging."

**Quick Take**: Use "action ramps" - start with tiny tasks to build momentum for more challenging work.

### Three Types of Self-Discipline
Effective self-discipline isn't monolithic—it requires three distinct approaches:

1. **Structural Discipline**: Systems and routines that keep you on the narrow path (habits, schedules, environment design)
2. **Reactive Discipline**: Wisdom to respond effectively to unexpected challenges and obstacles
3. **Expansive Discipline**: Deliberate pushing beyond comfort zones to grow and improve

Most people focus only on structural discipline, missing the crucial elements of adaptive response and intentional growth. Understanding which type you need in different situations helps build comprehensive self-mastery.

> "Structural discipline keeps us tethered to the narrow path; reactive discipline helps us respond wisely to the unexpected; expansive discipline is about aspiration and growth—what more can you do?"

**Quick Take**: Assess which type of discipline you need in each situation rather than applying the same approach to all challenges.

### The Power of Habit Stacking
Building new habits becomes easier when you attach them to existing routines. The formula: "After/Before [current habit], I will [new habit]." This leverages neural pathways already established in your brain, reducing the willpower required for new behaviors.

You can also use conditional statements: "When [situation occurs], I will [desired action]." This creates automatic triggers that bypass decision fatigue and make good behavior the default response rather than requiring conscious choice.

> "To make habit stacking easier and simpler, here's a formula you can use: After/Before [current habit], I will [new habit]."

**Quick Take**: Link new desired behaviors to established habits using specific situational triggers.

### Motion Versus Action
Not all activity is productive. The book distinguishes between "motion" (busy work that feels productive but doesn't advance goals) and "action" (direct progress toward meaningful objectives). Researching, planning, and preparing can easily become forms of procrastination if they never lead to execution.

The solution is to schedule specific times for both motion and action, using motion deliberately to inform action rather than replace it. Set dedicated time for planning, then equal or greater time for execution based on those plans.

> "By this point, you may be wondering: How can you tell the difference between useful, intelligent planning and researching, and procrastination?"

**Quick Take**: Allocate specific time blocks for planning separate from execution, ensuring motion serves action rather than replacing it.

## Best Quotes
- "Learning to master the power of action allows you to access: the life you truly want, your full potential, new opportunities and possibilities, a sense of control over your destiny, and the deep satisfaction of knowing you gave it your all."
- "Reading this book will bring precisely zero benefit to your life. Yes, you read that right. That's because the words in this book do not hold any innate value in themselves. Rather, their value will only become apparent when activated—that is, put into practice by you, right now, in your actual life."
- "Most decisions are reversible. You can act right now, even though you're not 100 percent clear on the plan, you're not feeling ready, and you're not super excited about it."
- "Motivation is better understood as a kind of momentum. It's like an engine on a cold winter's morning—it may take some effort to get it started, but once it's warm and running, it works easily and smoothly."
- "If success comes after a series of failures and adaptations, then the right strategy is to get started as quickly as possible getting those failures under your belt!"

## Action Items
- Start a "5-second countdown" habit: count down from 5 and immediately act when you reach 1, without overthinking
- Apply the 37 Percent Rule to your next decision: research briefly, then act with 70% of desired information
- Create an "action ramp" for difficult tasks: begin with 5 minutes of easy work to build momentum
- Implement habit stacking by attaching one new desired behavior to an existing daily routine
- Schedule separate time blocks for planning (motion) and execution (action) this week
- Practice the "1% better daily" approach: identify one small improvement you can make tomorrow

## Questions to Consider
- What's the difference between productive planning and procrastination in your life right now?
- Which type of self-discipline (structural, reactive, or expansive) do you need most right now?
- What belief about "needing motivation to start" has been holding you back?
- What's the smallest action you could take today toward your biggest goal?
- How much time do you spend gathering information versus taking action?
- What existing habit could you stack a new desired behavior onto?

## Conclusion
This book is worth your time precisely because it refuses to offer easy answers or magical solutions. Instead, it provides uncomfortable but effective truths about human psychology and behavior change. The biggest reason to read it is that it immediately calls you to action—literally demanding that you practice what you're learning as you read.

Hollins's approach is refreshingly direct: stop waiting for perfect conditions, stop believing you need motivation to start, and recognize that action itself is the solution to most avoidance problems. The book's greatest strength is its emphasis on immediate implementation rather than theoretical understanding.

If you're tired of self-help books that leave you feeling inspired but unchanged, this practical guide offers the antidote. It won't make difficult tasks enjoyable, but it will give you the psychological tools to do them anyway—because that's ultimately what separates people who achieve their goals from those who merely dream about them.
