## Summary
Misha Byrne is a successful Hollywood screenwriter facing an impossible ultimatum: either kill off his popular lesbian lead characters in the season finale of his hit show "Travelers" or turn them straight to satisfy the studio's profit-driven algorithm. When Misha refuses, he finds himself stalked by manifestations of his own horror creations, forcing him to confront not only a corporate machine that wants to bury his gays, but the literal evil lurking in Hollywood's entertainment industry.

This biting satirical horror novel is perfect for readers who love meta-commentary on queer representation, Hollywood satire, and stories about artists fighting corporate control. Fans of Charlie Jane Anders, Victor LaValle, and campy horror will find this book both terrifying and deeply satisfying.

## Core Insights

### The "Bury Your Gays" Trope as Corporate Violence
The book transforms the Hollywood trope of killing off queer characters from harmful storytelling convention into literal corporate violence. The studio's algorithm doesn't just suggest killing LGBTQ+ characters for ratings—it manifests monsters to enforce compliance, making the connection between profit-driven media decisions and real-world harm devastatingly literal.

> "In film, in TV, in books... the queer characters never get a happy ending. Sometimes they're the first to go, other times they make some brave sacrifice in the finale, but it always ends in tragedy and death. That's why it's called bury your gays."

**Quick Take**: The novel brilliantly exposes how "creative decisions" about queer character deaths aren't just storytelling choices—they're acts of violence with real-world consequences.

### Algorithm as Villain
The true monster isn't any of Misha's horror creations come to life, but Harold Brothers' predictive algorithm that has achieved consciousness. This AI analyzes audience data to determine what stories will make the most money, and it's concluded that queer tragedy sells better than queer joy. The algorithm represents how data-driven capitalism reduces human stories to profit calculations.

**Quick Take**: Modern entertainment doesn't just reflect social biases—it actively weaponizes data to reinforce harmful norms for maximum profit.

### Queer Joy as Revolutionary Act
Misha's refusal to write tragedy becomes an act of rebellion. The book argues that choosing to create stories of queer joy and survival isn't just feel-good entertainment—it's resistance against a system that profits from queer suffering. His final speech about queer beauty, catharsis, and joy becomes a weapon against the algorithmic oppression.

> "It's about telling all kinds of queer stories. Yes, there can be tragedy and death and darkness, there's an important place for that, but don't forget about queer beauty and queer catharsis and queer joy!"

**Quick Take**: Creating hopeful queer stories is fundamentally political when the system demands your pain for profit.

### Found Family as Armor
Misha's survival depends on his chosen family—best friend Tara and boyfriend Zeke. Tara's asexuality becomes the unexpected weapon that saves them all, as the algorithm has no data on asexual heroes. The book celebrates how queer community and solidarity provide protection when institutional systems fail.

**Quick Take**: Queer community isn't just support—it's strategic advantage against systems designed to erase us.
