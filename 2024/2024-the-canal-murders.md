## Core Insights

### The Impossible Crime
The central puzzle revolves around how Annie Shipton was murdered on her narrowboat "Moorhen" without leaving any forensic evidence of an attacker. She was stabbed from behind while steering, yet the confined space at the tiller makes it seemingly impossible for someone to approach unseen. The boat was found drifting downstream with no signs of struggle or forced entry.

> "It's a very confined area for a murder to take place, and unless the killer was invisible, I find it hard to believe our victim didn't notice someone was there."
> _Dr. Miriam Coates, pathologist_

**Quick Take**: The story masterfully uses the physical constraints of narrowboat life to create a locked-room mystery on water.

### The Canal Community Dynamics
The book explores the tensions between different groups living on the canal: the established folk music community (led by Annie and her friends from the former band Rowan) versus newer arrivals like Laura and Darren Ward. Class conflicts and lifestyle clashes create a web of potential motives among the tight-knit canal community.

> "There are problem people in all boating communities—refugees from the town who don't know how to behave."
> _Annie Shipton's controversial blog post_

**Quick Take**: The canal setting provides a perfect microcosm of society, where close quarters and resource scarcity intensify personal conflicts.

### The Folk Music Legacy
Annie Shipton was the former lead singer of Rowan, a folk group that sang about northern working-class life. The band's history—including tragedy when Simon Anderson (brother of band member Bob) was killed in a car accident—holds secrets that connect to the present murder. The music theme adds cultural depth and emotional resonance to the investigation.

> "We performed our often poignant songs about the lives of ordinary people in old northern landscapes with great tenderness and skill, singing about hardship, love and loss."
> _From the Airedale Mail review of Rowan_

**Quick Take**: The folk music background provides both atmosphere and crucial backstory, with the past informing present motives.
