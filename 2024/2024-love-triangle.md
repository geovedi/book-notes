# Love Triangle
**Authors**: Matt Parker | **Year**: 2024

## Summary
"Love Triangle" is a captivating exploration of how triangles and trigonometry shape our modern world, written by stand-up comedian and mathematician Matt Parker. The book reveals that behind every aspect of our technological civilization lies the hidden mathematics of triangles - from the roads we drive on to the signals that power our digital communication. Parker demonstrates that triangles are not just abstract concepts from geometry class but are fundamental tools that enable everything from ancient construction to modern quantum mechanics.

This book is perfect for anyone who hated math in school but is curious about how the world actually works, as well as math enthusiasts who want to see their favorite subject in action. You'll discover how triangles help solve legal disputes, build skyscrapers, create music, and even understand the nature of reality itself.

## Core Insights

### Triangles Are Nature's Perfect Problem-Solvers
Triangles are "nature's sudokus" - just waiting to be solved. What makes triangles incredibly powerful is that if you know as few as half their measurements (with at least being a length), you can calculate all the rest. This property makes triangles perfect for measuring distances and solving real-world problems. Parker shows how a mathematics professor used triangles to calculate the altitude of a hot-air balloon from a single photograph, helping farmers win a lawsuit against balloon operators who scared their pigs to death.

> "Triangles are like a super-easy crossword where you get half the letters and the answer is always 'triangle'."
**Quick Take**: Triangles unlock measurement possibilities that would otherwise be impossible, making them essential tools for everything from construction to legal evidence.

### Ancient Mathematics Still Powers Modern Technology
The same geometric principles used by ancient Egyptians to divide land after Nile floods now enable our GPS systems, computer graphics, and digital communications. Parker traces how the Rhind Mathematical Papyrus (c. 1550 BCE) contained problems about calculating pyramid slopes, showing that practical geometry has been crucial for civilization for millennia. The Romans built their famous straight roads using triangulation, and modern engineers still use these principles to construct everything from bridges to microchips.

**Quick Take**: The mathematics you learned (or hated) in school is the foundation of virtually every technology you use daily.

### Everything Can Be Reduced to Triangles
Parker's most profound insight is that all complex shapes and signals ultimately break down into triangles. Any 3D object in computer graphics is represented as a mesh of triangles, and any signal - from music to radio waves - can be built from sine waves (which are fundamentally based on triangle relationships). This mathematical universality explains why triangles appear everywhere from quantum mechanics to music production.

> "You are literally made of sine waves. You are built of triangles. Reality is triangles."
**Quick Take**: Understanding triangles gives you a glimpse into the fundamental mathematical nature of reality itself.

### Practical Mathematics Saves Lives and Money
The book is filled with examples of how trigonometry solves real-world problems that matter. Parker shows how oil field workers use geometry daily to advance their careers, how pool players use angles to win games, and how engineers use triangles to prevent disasters. One memorable story involves someone who tried to get out of a speeding ticket by claiming they put bigger wheels on their car, though they incorrectly attributed their argument to Pythagoras instead of understanding the actual mathematics involved.

> "I said, Pythagoras and physics, a small circle spins faster than a big circle, what evidence do I need, it's mathematics."
**Quick Take**: Mathematical literacy isn't just academic - it's a practical skill that can advance careers and solve real problems.

### The Hidden Beauty in Everyday Mathematics
Parker reveals how mathematical beauty appears in unexpected places. The 39° angle behind a duck and the angle of a rainbow both result from the same wave interference mathematics. Brian May's iconic guitar sound in Queen's "Bohemian Rhapsody" comes from understanding how waves interfere with each other - knowledge he used to wire his guitar pickups in an unconventional way. These examples show that appreciating mathematics doesn't require solving equations but recognizing the patterns that govern our world.

> "Duck wakes and rainbows are both the result of the same bit of maths."
**Quick Take**: Mathematical awareness enriches your experience of everyday phenomena, from watching birds to listening to music.

## Best Quotes

- "Pythagoras has become a kind of mascot for complicated but kind-of-pointless maths. You know something is burned into the popular psyche when it is referenced in episodes of both Inspector Morse and Family Guy."

- "I want everyone to love triangles. And to which mathematician did Acaster attribute this fictitious maths catchphrase? Pythagoras, of course."

- "Triangles are everything and everything is triangles."

- "I don't think it would take much arguing to persuade anyone that an understanding of waves makes our modern, digitally connected world possible."

- "We live in a universe made of maths. What we think of as solid matter is actually wave functions."

## Action Items
- Look for triangles in your daily environment - notice how they're used in architecture, design, and nature
- Try measuring something using shadows and similar triangles, just as the ancient Greeks measured pyramids
- When you see a news report about technology, consider the hidden mathematics that makes it possible
- Pay attention to angles in sports - pool, basketball, soccer - and notice how players intuitively use geometry
- Explore how the GPS in your phone fundamentally relies on triangulation to determine your location

## Questions to Consider
- If everything can be reduced to triangles, what does this tell us about the nature of reality itself?
- How has our casual attitude toward geometric precision (like mislabeling shapes on packaging) affected our technological capabilities?
- What aspects of your daily life rely on mathematics you don't even see?
- If triangles are so fundamental, why do most people stop thinking about them after geometry class?
- How might understanding the mathematical principles behind everyday phenomena change how you experience the world?

## Conclusion
"Love Triangle" is absolutely worth your time if you've ever wondered how the world actually works beneath the surface. Parker's humor and real-world examples transform potentially dry mathematical concepts into engaging stories that reveal the hidden architecture of our technological civilization. The biggest reason to read this book is that it will forever change how you see the world - you'll start noticing triangles everywhere and appreciating the mathematical foundation of everything from your morning commute to the music you stream.

What makes this book exceptional is how it bridges the gap between abstract mathematics and practical reality, showing that the geometry you may have dreaded in school is actually the secret sauce that makes modern life possible. By the end, you might just agree with Parker's conclusion: "Triangles are everything and everything is triangles" - and understand why that's not just mathematical hyperbole but a fundamental truth about how our universe operates.
