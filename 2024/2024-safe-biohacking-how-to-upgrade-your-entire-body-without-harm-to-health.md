**Original Title**: Безопасный биохакинг. Как прокачать весь организм без вреда для здоровья
**Author**: Kirill Sergeevich Masliev | **Year**: 2024 

## Summary
"Safe Biohacking" is a comprehensive guide that demystifies the biohacking movement and provides evidence-based strategies for optimizing health and longevity without dangerous extremes. Dr. Masliev, a physician with over 20 years of experience, argues against the aggressive pharmaceutical approach to biohacking that promises immediate results but long-term damage. Instead, he advocates for a systematic, scientific approach to health optimization based on regular diagnostics, proper nutrition, physical activity, and mental wellness.

The book targets busy modern people who want to improve their health and quality of life but are confused by conflicting information about wellness trends and biohacking supplements. Readers will gain practical knowledge about essential health tests, nutritional strategies, exercise protocols, and mental health practices that can add years of healthy, active life.

## Core Insights

### The Safe Biohacking Philosophy: Race Car vs. Rolls-Royce
True biohacking isn't about pushing your body to extreme limits with powerful stimulants and aggressive therapies that provide short-term gains but long-term damage. The author uses a powerful analogy: the race car performs incredibly but burns out quickly, while the Rolls-Royce with proper maintenance lasts for decades. Similarly, using pharmaceutical stimulants, growth hormones, or extreme interventions might boost performance temporarily but will cause your body to "uncontrollably crumble" after decades. The book advocates for sustainable, long-term health optimization rather than short-term performance enhancement.

> "The secret to improving life cannot be found separately in medications, miracle diets, or fashionable exercise complexes. In the end, there is no universal recipe for improving the well-being of all people."
> _Original: "Секрет к улучшению жизни не может быть найден отдельно в медикаментах, чудодейственных диетах или модных комплексах упражнений. В конце концов не существует универсального рецепта для улучшения самочувствия всех людей."_

**Quick Take**: Focus on gradual, sustainable health improvements rather than seeking quick fixes or "magic pills" that promise immediate transformation.

### Diagnostic Foundation: The Ten Essential Tests
Rather than spending thousands on comprehensive testing panels, the book identifies ten crucial biomarkers that provide the most valuable insights into your health status. These include lipid panels (cholesterol fractions), complete blood count, glycated hemoglobin, homocysteine, electrolytes, hormone levels, vitamin D, urine analysis, and blood pressure monitoring. The author reveals that "rich long-livers" actually spend very little on testing but get annual checkups and detox treatments, while regular people need consistent monitoring to counteract environmental damage.

> "If every six months to a year you take these 10 tests, you will receive a guaranteed tool for managing your health and significantly improving the quality and length of your life."
> _Original: "Если раз в полгода-год вы будете сдавать эти 10 анализов, то получите на руки гарантированный инструмент управления своим здоровьем и значительного улучшения качества жизни, ее продолжительности."_

**Quick Take**: Regular monitoring of key health indicators provides early warning signs and allows for timely intervention before serious problems develop.

### Nutritional Intelligence: Beyond Diet Trends
The book presents a sophisticated approach to nutrition that goes beyond simplistic diet rules. Dr. Masliev explains evolutionary eating patterns, the importance of macronutrient balance, and practical strategies for managing blood sugar through the glycemic index. He introduces several "hacks" for reducing glucose spikes: consuming apple cider vinegar before meals, eating fiber first, taking 10-minute walks after eating, and following the eating sequence of fiber → fats → proteins → carbohydrates. The author debunks many "healthy" foods and marketing claims while emphasizing that orange juice is actually not healthier than cola due to sugar content.

> "Read labels carefully: bright labels on products are misleading. Orange juice is no healthier than cola."
> _Original: "Внимательно читайте состав на этикетке: яркие наклейки на продуктах вводят в заблуждение. Апельсиновый сок не полезнее колы."_

**Quick Take**: Focus on managing blood sugar through food sequencing and timing rather than eliminating entire food groups or following restrictive diets.

### The Movement Prescription: More Than Exercise
Physical activity is presented not just as structured workouts but as essential movement throughout the day. The book highlights the dangers of prolonged sitting ("the more you sit, the earlier you'll die") and provides practical solutions including proper posture, regular movement breaks, and a simple fitness assessment test. The author covers different types of exercise (aerobic, anaerobic, static, dynamic) and explains their specific benefits for longevity and disease prevention, including cancer risk reduction.

> "The more you sit, the earlier you die - move!"
> _Original: "Чем больше сидите, тем раньше умрете, – двигайтесь"_

**Quick Take**: Integrate movement throughout your day, not just during dedicated workout sessions, and focus on maintaining flexibility and balance as key indicators of biological age.

### Brain Fog Solutions: Mental Health Optimization
The book addresses the modern epidemic of "brain fog" with evidence-based solutions. Dr. Masliev identifies multiple causes including hormonal changes, nutritional deficiencies, medications, and climate factors. He recommends nine science-backed supplements including Vitamin D, Omega-3 fatty acids, magnesium, Vitamin C, B vitamins, L-theanine, and phosphatidylserine. The author emphasizes that 20 minutes is the optimal duration for mental practice sessions and explains the "visualization method" used by athletes to improve performance by up to 30%.

> "Through simple mental exercises, it is possible to increase strength."
> _Original: "Путем простых ментальных упражнений возможно увеличить силу."_

**Quick Take**: Address brain fog through a combination of proper nutrition, targeted supplementation, regular exercise, stress management, and mental training techniques.
