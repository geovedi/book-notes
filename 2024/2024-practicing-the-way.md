# Practicing the Way: Be With Jesus. Become Like Him. Do as He Did
**Authors**: John Mark Comer | **Year**: 2024
**Category**: Spirituality & Religion

## Summary
"Practicing the Way" presents a radical re-framing of what it means to follow Jesus—not as a convert to Christianity, but as an apprentice in the kingdom of God. John Mark Comer argues that Jesus' invitation was always "Come, follow me"—a call to arrange our entire lives around three driving goals: to be with Jesus, become like him, and do as he did. The book challenges the modern Western approach to discipleship that often creates Christians who aren't actually apprentices of Jesus, offering instead a comprehensive framework for spiritual formation through intentional practices and rhythms that open our lives to God's transforming power.

This book is ideal for both new believers seeking to understand what following Jesus actually entails, and longtime Christians feeling stuck in their spiritual journey. It's especially valuable for those who sense a gap between their current experience and the vibrant, transformative life Jesus promised, offering practical pathways to genuine spiritual formation.

## Core Insights

### The Three Goals of an Apprentice
Jesus' model of discipleship was a radical departure from modern Western Christianity. In first-century Jewish culture, a disciple (talmid) was an apprentice who organized their entire life around three driving goals. Being with Jesus meant leaving everything behind to spend every waking moment in his presence, covered in his dust as they walked from town to town. Becoming like him involved copying his tone, mannerisms, and way of being—you wanted to become your rabbi. Doing as he did was the ultimate aim: to carry on his work in the world. This wasn't just about knowledge acquisition but embodied learning through relationship and practice.

> "Apprenticeship to Jesus—that is, following Jesus—is a whole-life process of being with Jesus for the purpose of becoming like him and carrying on his work in the world."

**Quick Take**: Discipleship isn't something done to you—it's someone you choose to become. You must accept Jesus' invitation to re-architect your entire life around apprenticeship.

### The Crisis of Modern Christianity
The book presents startling statistics that reveal a massive gap between those who identify as Christian (63% of Americans) and actual apprentices of Jesus (around 4%). This creates what Comer calls a "two-tier church" where many people believe in God and attend church but haven't restructured their daily lives around apprenticeship to Jesus. The result is widespread hypocrisy, spiritual stagnation, and mass disillusionment with faith, particularly among millennials leaving the church in droves.

> "The greatest issue facing the world today is not climate change, surveillance capitalism, or nuclear war...it's whether those identified as 'Christians' will become disciples—students, apprentices, practitioners—of Jesus Christ."

**Quick Take**: Being a Christian doesn't automatically make you an apprentice of Jesus. Jesus never asked people to become Christians; he invited them into a life of apprenticeship.

### Spiritual Formation Isn't Just Information
Comer identifies three losing strategies for spiritual formation: relying on willpower alone (which fails like 80% of New Year's resolutions), thinking more Bible study automatically equals transformation, or waiting for a spiritual "zap" from heaven. Instead, he presents formation as the slow, intentional process of being formed by Jesus through practicing his way of life. As philosopher James K.A. Smith notes, "You can't think your way to Christlikeness"—because following Jesus is less like learning quantum physics and more like learning aikido, something you do with your whole body.

> "Love isn't an intellectual theory; it's an embodied way of being."

**Quick Take**: Transformation happens through practice, not just information. You become like Jesus by doing what Jesus did.

### Abiding: The Practice of God's Presence
The first goal—"be with Jesus"—is what Jesus called "abiding." This isn't about monastic withdrawal but learning to be in two places at once: changing diapers while being with Jesus, commuting while resting in Jesus, working while abiding in Jesus. Drawing on saints from Brother Lawrence to A.W. Tozer, Comer presents this as developing "mental habits of inward orientation" through which we train our minds to constantly return to God throughout the day. Like a compass needle returning north, we can habituate our consciousness to make God our emotional home.

> "The time of busyness does not with me differ from the time of prayer; and in the noise and clatter of my kitchen, while several persons are at the same time calling for different things, I possess God in as great tranquility as if I were upon my knees."

**Quick Take**: All of us are abiding in something—the question is what? You can train your mind to naturally return to God as your default setting.

### Becoming Like Jesus Through Contemplation
The second goal—"become like Jesus"—happens primarily through contemplation: "I look at Him, He looks at me, and we are happy." This isn't merely thinking positive thoughts but experiencing God's love, which transforms us into people of love. As psychologists note, we are loving to the degree we have been loved. Paul's prayer for the Ephesians captures this: to "know this love that surpasses knowledge"—experiencing God's love in our inner beings, not just knowing about it intellectually.

> "The most important thing that happens between God and the human soul is to love and to be loved."

**Quick Take**: We become more loving by experiencing love, not by hearing about it. God wants to love you into a person of love.

### The Rule of Life: Structuring for Spiritual Growth
Comer introduces the ancient concept of a "Rule of Life"—a structured set of practices and rhythms that arrange your life around apprenticeship to Jesus. Unlike legalistic rule-following, this is about creating the conditions for transformation. Just as an athlete structures their life around training, or an artist around their craft, apprentices structure their lives around being with Jesus, becoming like him, and doing as he did. This includes practices like prayer, Scripture reading, solitude, sabbath, and community, but always as pathways to relationship with Jesus rather than ends in themselves.

> "Transformation is possible if we are willing to arrange our lives around the practices, rhythms, and truths that Jesus himself did, which will open our lives to God's power to change."

**Quick Take**: You don't drift into spiritual formation. You must intentionally structure your life to create space for God's transforming work.

## Conclusion
"Practicing the Way" is both a wake-up call and an invitation—an urgent challenge to the complacency of Western Christianity and a compelling vision of what's possible when we take Jesus' invitation to apprenticeship seriously. Comer succeeds brilliantly in translating ancient wisdom into contemporary relevance without losing depth, making the radical call of Jesus feel both challenging and achievable.

The book is worth your time if you've ever sensed that there should be more to the Christian life than you're currently experiencing, or if you're troubled by the gap between Jesus' teachings and the reality of modern Western Christianity. Comer doesn't just diagnose the problem; he provides a clear, practical pathway forward that honors both the sovereignty of God and our responsibility to cooperate with our own transformation.

The biggest reason to read this book is that it might just change your life—not through a quick fix or spiritual high, but through the slow, steady, ultimately joyful work of apprenticeship to Jesus. As Comer reminds us, this is the life we were created for, the life our souls truly crave. And it's available to anyone willing to accept the ancient invitation: "Come, follow me."
