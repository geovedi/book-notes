# Putinistan
**Original Title**: Putinistán
**Author**: Xavier Colás | **Year**: 2024

## Summary
Putinistan is a penetrating examination of how Russia devolved from a brief period of post-Soviet freedom into Vladimir Putin's authoritarian "hallucinated country led by a hallucinated president." Written by a Spanish journalist who spent over a decade reporting from Moscow, the book traces Russia's tragic misunderstanding of freedom in the 1990s and its descent into what the author calls a "securocracy"—a system where security is weaponized to justify totalitarian control. Colás argues that Russia's invasion of Ukraine was not merely a foreign policy decision but the inevitable culmination of an internal disease that began with Russia's failure to build genuine civil society after communism.

For readers seeking to understand not just the Ukraine war but the deeper psychological and political mechanisms that transformed Russia from a potential democracy into an imperialist aggressor, Putinistan offers crucial insights. The book explains how propaganda, homophobia, historical revisionism, and the exploitation of Russian resentment created the perfect conditions for Putin's "eternity politics" where change itself became the enemy.

## Core Insights

### Russia's Fundamental Misunderstanding of Freedom
Colás identifies the central tragedy of post-Soviet Russia: in the chaotic 1990s, Russians confused freedom with poverty and democracy with instability. This "misunderstanding about freedom" created the perfect opening for Putin to offer security in exchange for liberty. As journalist Tatiana Felgenhauer explains, "We haven't recovered from the discrediting of democracy in the nineties" because "between the USSR and Putin there was no time to create a civil society."

> "In each dawn the sun set too quickly in Russia. The winter in St. Petersburg is famous for its white nights, but less has been written about the winter and its dark days: the sun remains trapped on the horizon like a beast trying to escape through a crack in the cage."
> _Original: "En cada amanecer el sol se puso demasiado rápido en Rusia. El verano en San Petersburgo es famoso por sus noches blancas, pero se ha escrito menos sobre el invierno y sus días oscuros: el sol se queda atrapado en el horizonte como una fiera intentando salir por una rendija de la jaula."_

**Quick Take**: Without the civil society foundations that enable democracy to weather economic hardship, Russians traded their uncertain freedom for Putin's promise of stability.

### Anti-Gay Propaganda as Testing Ground
The book reveals how Russia's 2013 "gay propaganda" law served as a trial run for later repression. By convincing ordinary Russians that LGBT rights were part of a Western moral corruption, the regime tested whether citizens would accept restrictions on others' freedoms. Since most Russians weren't gay, the regime reasoned nobody would defend them—establishing a pattern that would later be used against war opponents.

> "The persecution of gays was the moral bait for Russians to renounce European political freedoms, which were presented as fused with Sodom and Gomorrah."
> _Original: "La persecución a los gais fue el cebo moral para que los rusos renunciasen a las libertades políticas europeas, que se les presentaron fusionadas con Sodoma y Gomorra."_

**Quick Take**: When citizens don't defend others' rights, they lose the moral foundation to defend their own.

### Media Transformation into Propaganda Machine
Colás documents the 2013 takeover of RIA Novosti news agency by Dmitry Kiselev—a homophobic propagandist who said gay organs shouldn't be transplanted—as the moment Russian media officially became propaganda. This wasn't just about silencing dissent but about actively discrediting reality itself, paving the way for war.

> "Kiselev was the antifascist-fascist that was needed. A man who preached hatred against homosexuals and glorified unlimited government power within the country and in its old territories, always with a bellicose rhetoric."
> _Original: "Kisélyov era el fascista-antifascista que hacía falta. Un hombre que pregonaba el odio contra los homosexuales y exaltaba el poder sin límites del gobierno ruso dentro del país y en sus viejos territorios, siempre con una retórica belicista."_

**Quick Take**: Propaganda works not by convincing people but by disorienting them until they can't distinguish truth from fiction.

### Securocracy: Security as Divine Right
Putinistan introduces "securocracy" as Russia's governing system—parallel to theocracy where military/police leaders replace priests as interpreters of divine will (national security). Like theocracies, securocracies cannot be questioned because only security officials can "interpret" threats, making them unchallengeable.

> "In a securocracy, the supreme good or divinity is security, decoded by those in charge of police or military structures. They are the only ones who can decide what must be done to keep the country safe."
> _Original: "En una securocracia, el bien supremo o la divinidad es la seguridad, decodificada por los que están al mando de las estructuras policiales o militares."_

**Quick Take**: When security becomes sacred, ordinary citizens have no right to question government decisions regardless of the consequences.

### The "Politics of Eternity"
Faced with aging and mortality, Putin adopted what Colás calls "politics of eternity"—obsessing over the past while eliminating the future as a threat. By moving Russia's founding myth from the failed 1917 revolution to the triumphant 1945 victory over fascism, Putin positioned Russia against the West while creating a system where change itself equals betrayal.

> "In a democracy, the future is the place where promises reside that often don't materialize. In a dictatorship, the future is where only threats supposedly reside, that in most cases never happen."
> _Original: "En una democracia, el futuro es el lugar donde residen unas promesas que muchas veces no se materializan. En una dictadura, el futuro es donde supuestamente residen solo amenazas, que en la mayoría de los casos no suceden jamás."_

**Quick Take**: Dictatorships fear the future because progress threatens their control; democracies embrace the future because change is their lifeblood.

## Action Items
- **Resist Propaganda Early**: Don't dismiss early propaganda as harmless—Russia's anti-gay campaign was testing ground for war propaganda
- **Defend Others' Rights**: When minority rights are attacked, speak up because restrictions tested on vulnerable groups expand to everyone
- **Value Independent Media**: Support diverse news sources and recognize when media becomes state propaganda
- **Beware Security Arguments**: Question claims that security requires sacrificing democracy—this is authoritarianism's primary justification
- **Remember History**: Authoritarian regimes often emerge from periods of chaos when citizens trade freedom for stability

## Questions to Consider
- How can societies build strong civil society foundations that survive economic hardship and political turmoil?
- What early warning signs indicate democracy is eroding into authoritarianism?
- How should democracies balance security concerns with protecting civil liberties during crises?
- Why do ordinary people in authoritarian systems often participate in their own oppression?
- Can Russia develop a democratic tradition after Putin, or will the cycle of authoritarianism continue?

## Conclusion
Putinistan is essential reading for understanding how democracy died in Russia and why that matters for the entire world. Colás, writing from deep personal experience as a journalist in Moscow, reveals that Russia's invasion of Ukraine wasn't an isolated act but the culmination of two decades of internal decay. The book's greatest strength is showing how authoritarianism creeps gradually through propaganda, historical revisionism, and the exploitation of legitimate grievances until a country where "everyone knows" what's happening lacks the language to say it.

The biggest reason to read Putinistan is its warning about how easily citizens can be convinced to trade freedom for security, especially when democracy is associated with economic hardship. Colás demonstrates that Russia's tragedy wasn't inevitable—it resulted from specific historical conditions and deliberate choices by Putin and his inner circle. Most importantly, the book reminds us that democracy requires constant defense not just against external threats but against the internal temptation to trade difficult freedoms for easy security.

Is it worth your time? Absolutely. In an era where authoritarianism is rising globally, understanding how it happened in Russia provides crucial lessons for protecting democracy everywhere. As Colás shows, the first step toward tyranny is convincing citizens that some people don't deserve rights—and the last step is discovering nobody has any rights left.
