# Isotopography
**Authors**: Niels Wilde | **Year**: 2024

## Summary
"Isotopography" presents a groundbreaking reinterpretation of Søren Kierkegaard's philosophy through the lens of topological realism—the study of place, space, and existence. Wilde argues that Kierkegaard's central question "what does it mean to exist?" can be understood as a fundamental exploration of how beings are situated in place and how place itself shapes identity and existence.

The book introduces "isotopography" as both a method and a concept: the study of "where we are" and "the place we ourselves are." Wilde contends that for Kierkegaard, becoming oneself is not merely an internal psychological process but a "movement at the place" where self, place, and possibility intersect. This radically repositions Kierkegaard from being seen primarily as a subjectivist philosopher to being understood as a realist thinker concerned with the concrete spatial and material conditions of existence.

**Who should read this**: Philosophy students and scholars interested in Kierkegaard, existentialism, or contemporary speculative realism; environmental philosophers seeking new frameworks for understanding human-place relationships; and anyone exploring how spatial thinking intersects with questions of identity and becoming.

## Core Insights

### Kierkegaard's Three-Limbed Topology of Place
Wilde identifies three interconnected dimensions in Kierkegaard's understanding of place: situatedness (being in a concrete socio-historical situation), movement (the dynamic process of becoming), and the event (the possibility of transformation through relation to the divine). Place is not merely a container for existence but an active participant in the process of becoming self. Each individual occupies a unique "topos" that both bounds them (closing-off) and opens them to others (opening-up).

> "To become oneself is a movement at the place, according to Kierkegaard. In a certain sense, this book has been nothing but an analysis of this one sentence."

**Quick Take**: Your identity isn't just internal—it's shaped by where you are, and where you are is shaped by how you become yourself.

### The Democracy of Objects
Drawing on object-oriented ontology, Wilde argues that Kierkegaard's philosophy places humans and non-humans on equal ontological footing. Flowers, clouds, theme parks, and customs occupy the same "where" as humans do. This challenges anthropocentric views and suggests that all objects participate in the same topological dynamics of closing-off (maintaining distinctness) and opening-up (relating to others).

> "For Kierkegaard, objects in all shapes and sizes such as theme parks, flowers, clouds, and customs occupy this 'where' on the same ontological footing as we do in what I with a term borrowed from Bryant calls a democracy of objects."

**Quick Take**: You're not the center of existence—everything shares the same fundamental relationship to place and possibility.

### Emplacement and Being-Placed
Wilde distinguishes between "emplacement" (finding ourselves in a given concrete situation) and "being-placed" (the prior movement that brings us into existence from a pre-situational condition). This double notion of situatedness [bestedelse] reveals how Kierkegaard understands existence as both thrown into a world and actively placed through a prior act of becoming. This creates a tension between the givenness of our situation and the possibility of transforming it.

> "We enter into existence. This double notion of situatedness [bestedille], I called 'emplacement' (being in a concrete socio-historical situation) and 'being-placed' (coming into existence from a situation prior to situatedness)."

**Quick Take**: You're both thrown into your situation and actively placed into it—understanding both helps you navigate your freedom within constraints.

### Elemental Atmospheres and Spherology
The book explores how places have atmospheric qualities—elemental attunements that shape our experience and possibilities. Wilde develops Kierkegaard's insights into how different "existence-spheres" (aesthetic, ethical, religious) can be understood as atmospheric responses to our fundamental situation. These spheres aren't just stages of development but different atmospheric ways of being-in-place that offer distinct possibilities for selfhood.

> "Where we are and the place, we ourselves are, constantly negotiates the fuzzy, indeterminate boundaries between them like the two sides of a Möbius strip."

**Quick Take**: The mood of your place shapes you as much as you shape it—pay attention to the atmosphere you inhabit.

### Divine Topology and the Middle Term
Wilde examines Kierkegaard's three definitions of God—as love, as possibility, and as the middle-term—to develop a "topology of the Kingdom." God is not a supreme being but an ontological structure that operates topologically: love grants distinctness while opening to relation, possibility maintains the contingency of reality, and the middle-term creates the space for indirect relation between separated beings. This reimagines divine presence as spatial and relational rather than hierarchical and interventionist.

> "God as the middle-term, which I interpret as a socio-ontological point rather than an ethical problem. Relations must be indirect because objects are separated and distinct from each other."

**Quick Take**: The divine isn't above or outside—it's the space between that makes genuine relation possible.

## Best Quotes

- "To become oneself is a movement at the place."
- "Where we are and the place we ourselves are, constantly negotiates the fuzzy, indeterminate boundaries between them like the two sides of a Möbius strip."
- "The boundaries between who we are and where we are become blurred and fuzzy."
- "In a time of global warming, the boundaries between who we are and where we are become blurred and fuzzy."
- "Love itself operates topologically – it appears and is made manifest as the fruits but withdraws as something unfathomable and inexhaustible."

## Deep Ethics for the Anthropocene

- Recognize your entanglement with non-human others—you share the same ontological footing as clouds, flowers, and customs
- Practice atmospheric awareness—notice how the mood and quality of places shape your possibilities
- Embrace indirect relation—genuine connection requires maintaining distinction while opening to others
- Respond from where you already are—you don't need to find the perfect vantage point to engage with global challenges
- Hold the tension between givenness and possibility—work within your situation while remaining open to transformation

## Questions to Consider

- How does your specific place (not just location but the entire network of relations) shape who you're becoming?
- What would it mean to take seriously the agency of non-human objects in your environment?
- How might understanding God as the space between rather than the being above change your approach to ethics or spirituality?
- In what ways are you both "emplaced" (thrown into your situation) and "being-placed" (actively positioned)?
- How can we develop a "deep ethics" that operates on the timescale of climate change while remaining grounded in particular places?

## Conclusion

"Isotopography" is a challenging but rewarding read that successfully revitalizes Kierkegaard for contemporary concerns. Wilde's topological reading offers fresh insights into perennial questions of identity, freedom, and relation while providing conceptual tools for addressing the ecological crisis. The book's greatest strength lies in its ability to bridge existential philosophy with speculative realism and environmental thought without reducing either to the other.

This is worth your time if you're interested in how spatial thinking can transform our understanding of human existence and our relationship to the non-human world. While the academic prose can be dense and the interdisciplinary approach demanding, Wilde's vision of a "deep ethics" grounded in topological realism offers a promising framework for navigating the blurred boundaries of the Anthropocene. The biggest reason to read this book is its radical reimagining of how place shapes possibility—not just where we are, but how the very structure of place makes becoming possible.
