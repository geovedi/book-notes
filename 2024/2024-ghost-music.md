## Core Insights

### The Gift of Seeing
Gideon possesses the rare ability to see and communicate with spirits, a gift that makes him uniquely qualified to help ghosts seek justice. This supernatural sensitivity allows him to interact with Kate and other spirits who cannot normally communicate with the living.
> "You still have your gift, Gideon. You can help scores of other people, too. So many murders go unpunished."
**Quick Take**: Sometimes our greatest burdens become our most powerful tools for helping others find peace.

### Three Years to Make Amends
The spirits in this story operate under a supernatural rule: they have exactly three years after death to seek justice and make things right before moving on. This time constraint creates urgency and explains Kate's desperate need to find someone who can help her expose the truth.
> "We all have three years to make amends. Three turnings of the seasons to make things right."
**Quick Take**: Time may heal all wounds, but justice often requires active intervention before peace can be found.

### The Price of Vengeance
Victor Solway's transformation from grieving father to ruthless murderer shows how grief can curdle into destructive rage when fueled by wealth and privilege. His elaborate scheme to force families to sell their apartments demonstrates how personal tragedy can become a weapon against others.
> "They took our son, Kate. They bankrupted me! And for what? How did you expect me to feel, when Michael died?"
**Quick Take**: Grief can either make us more compassionate or more cruel - the choice reveals our true character.

### The Power of Collective Justice
The murdered families' spirits work together to confront their killers, showing that justice is often a collective effort rather than an individual pursuit. Their combined supernatural power overwhelms the living criminals who believed themselves untouchable.
> "They came here to get justice, no more than that."
**Quick Take**: Even in death, unity and shared purpose can overcome seemingly invincible evil.

### Love Beyond Death
The relationship between Gideon and Kate challenges our understanding of mortality and connection. Their bond transcends the boundary between life and death, suggesting that love's power extends beyond physical existence.
> "When I'm with you, yes - because you have the gift. But otherwise, no. And you know it, don't you? You've known it for a long time."
**Quick Take**: True connection exists in the realm of spirit and emotion, not merely in physical presence.
