# Image Events: Post-Structuralist Developments of Husserl's Phenomenology of Image Consciousness
**Original Title**: Bildgeschehen: Post-strukturalistische Entfaltungen von Husserls Phänomenologie des Bildbewusstseins
**Author**: Alice Mara Serra | **Year**: 2024

## Summary
This profound philosophical work explores the phenomenon of "Bildgeschehen" (image events) through a sophisticated dialogue between Edmund Husserl's phenomenology of image consciousness and Jacques Derrida's post-structuralist deconstruction. Serra traces how images "happen" rather than simply "exist," investigating the dynamic processes through which visual representations emerge, surprise us, and resist complete conceptualization.

The book bridges German phenomenological tradition and French post-structuralism to reveal how images operate beyond mere representation. Serra argues that image events occur when what was predetermined as "image" escapes its expected ontological categories and unexpectedly affects us through minimal restructurings—parergonal traces, aperspective strokes, and invisible affecting forces. This creates a new understanding of how images work in the world, particularly relevant to our contemporary image-saturated culture.

Philosophy students, art theorists, and cultural critics will gain deep insights into the fundamental nature of visual experience, while artists and photographers will discover new frameworks for understanding how their creations function beyond traditional aesthetic categories.

## Core Insights

### The Concept of "Bildgeschehen" (Image Events)
Images don't simply exist—they happen. "Bildgeschehen" refers to the dynamic event-like nature of images, where visual representations break free from their expected categories and unexpectedly affect viewers. This concept challenges traditional phenomenology's tendency to understand images primarily as intentional objects of consciousness.

> "Images happen when what was ontologically or ontically determined in advance as image—whether as image-of, natural images, art images, mass images, etc.—withdraws from these ready-made determinations and one is unexpectedly crossed, 'affected,' 'awakened,' 'pointed' by restructurings of the emergent."
_Original: "Bilder geschehen, indem das, was im Voraus ontologisch bzw. ontisch als Bild bestimmt wurde, und zwar als Bild-von, als natürliche Bilder, als Kunstbilder, als Massenbilder usw., sich diesen Zuhandenheits-Bestimmungen entzieht und man, ohne dies zu erwarten, durchkreuzt, 'affiziert', 'geweckt', 'pointiert' wird von Umstrukturierungen des Aufkommenden."_

**Quick Take**: Images work through surprise and unexpected affect, not through planned representation or aesthetic contemplation alone.

### Minimal Restructuring of Image Events
Rather than understanding images through complex philosophical systems, Serra proposes "minimal restructuring" as the key to how image events operate. This includes parergonal traces (marginal elements), aperspective strokes (non-perspective drawing marks), and invisible affecting forces that operate beneath conscious perception.

The analysis traces how Derrida's concepts of writing (écriture), trace, and stroke (trait) create new ways of understanding how visual meaning emerges beyond traditional representation. These minimal restructurings precede and condition our conscious experience of images.

**Quick Take**: The power of images lies in their marginal, invisible, and unexpected elements that escape our full control.

### The Photographic as Skiagraphy (Shadow-Writing)
Drawing on Derrida, Serra reconceptualizes photography not as light-writing but as "shadow-writing" (skiagraphy). This reveals how photographic images always carry traces of loss, mourning, and temporal delay—the shadow of what has been.

This perspective transforms our understanding of photography from capturing present reality to encoding absence and temporal displacement. Every photograph becomes a document of something that has already passed, carrying within it the structure of loss.

> "It remains to be known what this is (τί ἐστι), the essence of the photographic form, considered from the viewpoint of a delay that creates itself by exceeding time in speed. A silent confession, perhaps, and silently hesitating, for it knows how to be silent, an infinitely elliptical discourse, mad with a single desire: to impress time with all times, and secretly, in the night, like a thief of fire, to archive the speed of light with the speed of light."

**Quick Take**: Photography's power comes from encoding loss and time's passage, not from capturing presence.

### The Role of the Unexpected
Drawing on Derrida's concept of "l'événement" (the event), Serra emphasizes that true image events occur through absolute surprise that cannot be anticipated within existing frameworks of understanding. This unexpectedness is not merely psychological but ontological—it challenges the very conditions through which we make sense of visual experience.

The book explores how the most powerful images operate precisely by exceeding our horizons of expectation, creating openings for new ways of seeing and understanding that cannot be reduced to existing categories.

> "The event as event, as absolute surprise, must fall upon me. Why? Because if it doesn't fall upon me, it means I see it coming, that there's a horizon of expectation."
_Original: "l'événement en tant qu'événement, en tant que surprise absolue, doit me tomber dessus. Pourquoi? Parce que s'il ne me tombe pas dessus, cela veut dire que je le vois venir, qu'il y a un horizon d'attente"_

**Quick Take**: The most powerful images work by exceeding our expectations and creating genuine surprise.

## Best Quotes

- "We think we have photography at our disposal, just as we do with the works of art preserved in museums, while it obviously continues to have us at its disposal, as the image that suddenly assails us, that seizes us..."
  _Original: "nous croyons disposer de la photographie, comme nous le faisons des œuvres d'art conservées au musée, alors qu'elle continue, bien évidemment, de disposer de nous, ainsi que le révèle l'image qui, tout à coup, nous assaille, qui nous poigne..."_

- "The classic legend about the origin of painting, told by Pliny—the outline of her lover thrown on the wall traced by the daughter of a doorkeeper in Sicyon—points to the irreducible indexical component."
  _Original: "La légende classique sur l'origine de la peinture, que raconte Pline – le contour du amant jeté sur le mur et dessiné par la fille du portier de Sicyone – pointe vers la composante indicielle irréductible."_

- "Philosophy is—so Derrida—a 'discourse of mourning,' but also and above all a discourse of 'denial of mourning.'"
  _Original: "La Philosophie soit – selon Derrida – un 'discours de la mort', mais aussi et avant tout un 'discours du déni de la mort'."_

- "Deconstruction is not inserted from the outside: it is already there, in the heart of constructs—institutions, concepts, philosophical systems, etc.—so already effective. Especially when it appears rather marginal there or not at all."

## Key Concepts to Remember
- **Image Events (Bildgeschehen)**: The dynamic happening of images rather than their static existence
- **Minimal Restructuring**: Small, often invisible forces that reorganize how images work
- **Parergonal Traces**: Marginal elements that affect central image meaning
- **Skiagraphy**: Understanding photography as shadow-writing rather than light-writing
- **Affective Signs**: Indicators that work through feeling rather than clear representation
- **Aperspective Vision**: Understanding images beyond traditional perspective systems

## Questions to Consider
- How do images escape our control and categories to affect us unexpectedly?
- What role do marginal, almost invisible elements play in visual experience?
- How does photography encode loss and temporal displacement rather than presence?
- Can we truly anticipate when an image will "happen" as an event rather than simply function as representation?
- How do contemporary digital images continue or transform these dynamics of image events?

## Conclusion
This is an essential read for anyone seeking to understand how images actually work in contemporary culture beyond traditional aesthetic theory. Serra's sophisticated synthesis of phenomenology and post-structuralism provides powerful tools for analyzing our current image-saturated world, from social media to contemporary art.

The book's greatest strength lies in showing how images operate through minimal restructurings and unexpected affects rather than through grand theoretical systems. This makes it particularly valuable for understanding viral images, meme culture, and other contemporary visual phenomena that seem to "just happen" despite our attempts to control them.

**Is it worth your time?** Absolutely if you're interested in philosophy, art theory, cultural studies, or understanding how visual culture actually operates in the 21st century. The biggest reason to read it is its radical rethinking of how images work—not as representations we control, but as events that happen to us.
