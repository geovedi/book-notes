**Original Title**: Charlotte Brontë and Contagion: Myths, Memes, and the Politics of Infection
**Author**: Jo Waugh | **Year**: 2024
**Category**: Fiction & Literature

## Summary
"Charlotte Brontë and Contagion" reveals how the celebrated Victorian novelist was deeply engaged with 19th-century debates about disease transmission, challenging the long-standing "Brontë myth" that presents her as an isolated, exceptional genius immune to the medical and social concerns of her time. Waugh demonstrates that Brontë's novels consistently explore the tensions between vulnerability and immunity, connection and isolation, and the social implications of disease transmission.

This scholarly work will appeal to literary scholars, Victorian studies enthusiasts, and readers interested in medical humanities who want to understand how great literature engages with scientific and social issues of its time.

## Core Insights

### The "Brontë Myth" vs. Medical Reality
The book argues that biographers and critics have systematically downplayed Charlotte Brontë's understanding of contagion, instead presenting her as an exceptional figure somehow "above" the common concerns about disease transmission that dominated Victorian society. This myth-making served to romanticize the Brontës as unique geniuses while distancing them from the messy realities of 19th-century life, including the very real threat of infectious diseases like tuberculosis, typhus, and cholera.

> "Health," Brontë told Ellen Nussey in 1849, "is a priceless blessing, and one of which we may easily be robbed."
_Original: "Health," Brontë told Ellen Nussey in 1849, "is a priceless blessing, and one of which we may easily be robbed."_
**Quick Take**: Brontë's anxiety about health was not neurotic hyperchondria but a rational response to the medical realities of her time.

### Disease Transmission in the Novels
Waugh reveals how Brontë's major novels—*Jane Eyre*, *Shirley*, and *Villette*—all engage with contemporary debates about contagion vs. miasma theory. The typhus epidemic at Lowood in *Jane Eyre*, the rabies scare in *Shirley*, and the weather-related health concerns in *Villette* all demonstrate Brontë's sophisticated understanding of how diseases spread and their social implications.

> "Contagion is, obviously, not delightful."
_Original: "[D]elightfully contagious" is the surprising "malapropism" used by a minor character, Mr Wynne, in Charlotte Brontë's second published novel, Shirley (1849)._
**Quick Take**: Brontë used disease transmission as a metaphor for social and political connections, exploring both their dangers and necessities.

### The 1840s: Epidemic Era
Brontë wrote during what Elaine Freedgood called "a stunning return of epidemic diseases," including cholera, typhus, and typhoid. Waugh shows how these outbreaks generated intense debates about disease transmission, public health, and social responsibility that directly influenced Brontë's work.

> "It appears to me that insurrections and battles are the acute diseases of nations."
_Original: "It appears to me," she writes, "that insurrections and battles are the acute diseases of nations"_
**Quick Take**: Brontë understood contagion as both literal disease and metaphor for social and political unrest.

### Consumption and Creativity
The book challenges the romanticized notion of "Romantic consumption" as a fashionable disease of artistic sensibilities. Instead, Waugh shows how Brontë presented tuberculosis/consumption as a serious medical condition affecting both the rich and poor, though with different social implications and treatment options.

**Quick Take**: The Brontës weren't romantic artists dying beautifully from consumption—they were victims of a serious infectious disease that their era couldn't properly treat or prevent.

## Conclusion
Jo Waugh's "Charlotte Brontë and Contagion" is a compelling corrective to decades of romanticized Brontë mythology. By restoring Charlotte Brontë to her proper place as a writer deeply engaged with the medical, scientific, and social debates of her time, Waugh not only gives us a more accurate portrait of the novelist but also demonstrates how great literature can illuminate the complex relationships between individual experience, scientific understanding, and social responsibility.

The book is worth your time if you're interested in Victorian literature, medical humanities, or simply want to understand how great writers engage with the urgent issues of their day. Its biggest contribution is showing how the "politics of infection" in Brontë's work speaks to enduring questions about human connection, vulnerability, and social responsibility that remain urgently relevant today.
