**Author**: Marjon Bohré-den Harder | **Year**: 2024

## Summary
This groundbreaking book challenges the common workplace advice to "leave emotions at home" by presenting emotions as crucial sources of information that we rarely use to direct and improve our work. In an era of artificial intelligence and thinking machines, our ability to feel and experience is what distinguishes us from robots, making emotional intelligence more valuable than ever in professional contexts.

The book presents emotions not as inconvenient interruptions to be suppressed or quickly resolved, but as valuable messengers containing essential information about our needs, values, and circumstances. Rather than rushing to offer tissues for tears or encouraging people to "cool down" after emotional outbursts, we should learn to pause, listen, and extract the wisdom contained within our emotional responses.

This comprehensive guide is designed for professionals who want to understand emotions better and use them effectively in work contexts, whether they're coaches, leaders, or anyone seeking to become more skilled in emotional navigation. It combines foundational knowledge about emotions with practical applications for twenty common emotions, serving as both a learning resource and a reference guide.

Perfect for coaches, leaders, mentors, and professionals who recognize that emotions play a crucial role in effective workplace relationships and personal growth, offering a roadmap to transform emotional responses from liabilities into valuable assets.

## Core Insights

### The Six-Step Method for Emotional Mastery
The book's cornerstone framework provides a systematic approach to extracting valuable information from emotions rather than suppressing them. This method transforms emotional reactions from automatic responses into conscious choices.

1. **Allow Your Emotion**: Give yourself permission to feel without judgment. Emotions are portals to self-knowledge, not problems to be solved. What isn't acknowledged cannot be used.
> "Emotional acceptance is actually a way of not judging. Not connecting a negative assessment to the fact that you feel something."
_Original: "Die emotional acceptance, dat is eigenlijk een manier van niet oordelen. Geen negatieve beoordeling verbinden aan het feit dat je iets voelt."_

2. **Find the Right Word**: Practice interoception—observing physical sensations in your body without interpretation. Use precise language to describe what you're experiencing, whether it's trembling, tightness, warmth, or vibration.
> "Listening to your body, that's what we call interoception. The perception of sensations in the body."
_Original: "Luisteren naar je lichaam, dat noemen we interoceptie. Het waarnemen van sensaties in het lichaam."_

3. **Check for Hidden Emotions**: Sometimes what appears as anger is actually fear, shame, or anxiety disguised as a more socially acceptable emotion. Like an onion, emotions often have layers that need gentle peeling to reveal the core message.

4. **Place in Broader Context**: Investigate what triggered the emotion. Consider recent events, conversations, or emotional contagion from others. Ask yourself: "Why does this affect me personally?" Your unique history and values shape your emotional responses.

5. **Regulate Your Emotion**: Use seven key strategies: breathing exercises, physical movement, changing your environment, seeking social connection, engaging in creative expression, practicing mindfulness, or using self-soothing techniques. The goal isn't elimination but management.

6. **Choose Your Behavior**: With emotional intelligence now available, make conscious choices aligned with your values and needs rather than reacting automatically. Consider who you want to be in this situation and what outcome serves everyone involved.

### Understanding Emotional Energy: The Four Quadrants
The book categorizes emotions along two axes: pleasant/unpleasant and high/low energy, creating a framework that helps identify appropriate responses and understand emotional functions.

**High Energy Emotions** (whether pleasant or unpleasant) prepare us for action and engagement. They expand our focus and motivate movement toward or away from something.

**Low Energy Emotions** support introspection, processing, and connection. They narrow our focus inward and encourage reflection or relationship-building.

This framework helps readers understand that all emotions serve purposes—even unpleasant ones—and that "negative" emotions aren't inherently bad, just different in their function and message.

### Emotions as Workplace Assets
Rather than viewing emotions as unprofessional liabilities, the book demonstrates how emotional awareness enhances leadership, teamwork, and decision-making. Emotional intelligence becomes a competitive advantage in human-AI collaboration.

Emotions reveal:
- Values alignment or conflict
- Unmet needs requiring attention
- Boundary violations requiring response
- Opportunities for growth and connection
- Environmental factors affecting performance

### The Human Connection Imperative
When we work with people's emotions, we glimpse their authentic selves—a precious gift even when uncomfortable. The connection forged through mutual humanity holds immense value for everyone involved.

> "When you work with people and their emotions, they let you see a part of who they are. That is a great gift, even if they are uncomfortable emotions."
_Original: "Als je werkt met mensen en hun emoties laten ze jou een deel zien van wie ze zijn. Dat is een groot cadeau, ook als het ongemakkelijke emoties zijn."_

## Key Emotions and Their Messages

### High Energy - Unpleasant
**Angst (Fear)**: Signals potential threat to wellbeing or survival. Narrows focus to danger, encourages survival strategies. Response: Focus on controllable factors, increase sense of agency.
> "Fear tells you that the environment is uncertain and the future is uncertain."
_Original: "Angst vertelt je dat de omgeving onzeker is en de toekomst ongewis."_

**Boosheid (Anger)**: Indicates boundary violation or value conflict. Signals that something important needs protection or restoration. Response: Address the violation clearly, restore what was damaged.

**Schaamte (Shame)**: Reveals perceived social rejection or failure to meet standards. Triggers hiding or avoidance behaviors. Response: Practice self-compassion, seek connection, remember shared humanity.

### Low Energy - Pleasant
**Dankbaarheid (Gratitude)**: Recognizes something or someone that brings joy and fulfills desires. Creates connection when expressed. Response: Share your gratitude actively, combat habituation through attention training.
> "It's not that happy people are more grateful, but grateful people are happier."
_Original: "Het is niet zo dat gelukkige mensen dankbaarder zijn, maar dankbare mensen zijn gelukkiger."_

**Compassie (Compassion)**: Responds to others' suffering with desire to help. Builds bridges and mutual support. Response: Take compassionate action while maintaining healthy boundaries.

**Kalmte (Calm)**: Indicates safety and alignment. Creates space for clear thinking and wise action. Response: Savor the calm, use it for important decisions and creative work.
