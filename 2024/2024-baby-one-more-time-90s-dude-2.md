## Core Story Arc

### The Lost Years
After high school graduation, Lucian overheard Serena planning to give up her dance scholarship to stay with him. Fearing he'd hold her back from her dreams, he told her he needed space and encouraged her to leave for dance school. Devastated, Serena left town and eventually married fellow dancer Giorgio, only to discover he was cheating on her when she became pregnant. Lucian married Melissa but their relationship fell apart, leaving him as a single father to his daughter Connie.

### Unexpected Reunion
A decade later, both families have returned to their hometown of Pine Grove. Their children—Seth and Connie—meet during a school field trip and immediately recognize their parents' connection from old yearbooks. The clever kids begin scheming to bring their parents together, starting with "accidentally" getting paired up for car rides to school and continuing with increasingly elaborate plans.

### Healing from Past Hurts
Both characters carry deep wounds from their previous relationships and their original separation. Serena struggles to trust again after Giorgio's betrayal, while Lucian battles guilt for how he ended things. Their interactions are tense but charged with undeniable chemistry, forcing them to confront old assumptions and unspoken truths that have haunted them for years.

### Children's Matchmaking
Seth and Connie's schemes escalate from car trouble to forcing their parents to chaperone a school dance together. Their innocence and genuine desire to see their parents happy create opportunities for Lucian and Serena to interact, slowly breaking down the walls between them and revealing that their feelings never truly faded.
