# We Were Perfect Parents Until We Had Children
**Authors**: Vanessa Raphaely, Karin Schimke | **Year**: 2024

## Summary
A refreshingly honest parenting guide that draws on seven years of collective wisdom from The Village, South Africa's largest online parenting community with 60,000 members. Instead of expert theories, this book delivers real, unfiltered experiences from actual parents raising tweens, teens, and young adults in today's challenging world. The authors embrace "perfectly imperfect" parenting, recognizing there's no single right way to raise children and that the best solutions come from shared community wisdom rather than prescriptive advice.

This book is ideal for parents feeling overwhelmed by expert advice who want authentic, relatable guidance from others walking the same path. Readers will gain practical wisdom, validation for their struggles, and the reassuring reminder that they're not alone in this parenting journey.

## Core Insights

### Perfectly Imperfect Parenting
The book's core philosophy rejects the myth of perfect parenting, embracing instead the reality that all parents make mistakes and that's okay. Drawing from tens of thousands of real parent experiences, the authors demonstrate that vulnerability and authenticity are more valuable than pretending to have it all figured out. This approach frees parents from the burden of perfectionism and allows them to focus on what truly matters—connection, growth, and learning alongside their children.

> "We cannot promise that we have created an infallible guide. There is no such thing. But as we've mined the content and revisited the jewels from so many parents, what we have found are remedies and suggestions which, we hope, will provide authentic support to enable any reader to raise their family their own perfectly imperfect way."

**Quick Take**: Your best parenting comes from being real, not perfect. Embrace mistakes as learning opportunities for both you and your children.

### It Takes a Village
Building on the African proverb "It takes a village to raise a child," the book demonstrates how community support is essential for modern parenting. The Village Facebook community became a lifeline for parents sharing everything from daily frustrations to major crises. The authors show that isolation amplifies parenting struggles while connection builds resilience. In an age where many families live far from extended support systems, creating intentional village networks—both online and offline—becomes crucial for parental well-being.

> "The saying 'It takes a village to raise a child' is thought to originate from the Nigerian Igbo proverb 'oran a zazu nwa', but similar proverbs and sentiments exist across the continent."

**Quick Take**: Actively build and nurture your parenting village. Whether through online communities, school networks, or neighborhood connections, you need ongoing support from other parents who understand your challenges.

### Model the Values You Want to See
A consistent theme throughout the parent contributions is that children learn far more from watching their parents' actions than from listening to their words. The book emphasizes that teaching respect, resilience, kindness, and emotional regulation starts with parents embodying these qualities themselves. Parents who prioritize self-care, handle stress constructively, and treat others with respect naturally model these behaviors for their children.

> "Children watch and learn from your actions far more than your words. If you're consistently showing up for yourself and your family, focusing on positive thinking and solutions rather than just seeing problems, they'll learn how to think and act with grit" — Hayley Reichert

**Quick Take**: Focus on being the person you want your children to become. Your daily actions, reactions, and choices are their most powerful lessons.

### Navigate Technology with Boundaries, Not Bans
Rather than completely restricting technology, successful parents learn to work with their children's digital reality while establishing healthy boundaries. The book shares practical strategies like keeping phones out of bedrooms at night, modeling healthy device use, and maintaining open conversations about online safety and digital citizenship. Parents who view technology as a tool to be managed rather than an enemy to be defeated have better outcomes.

> "A very sensible practice that many Villagers apply is for teenagers not to have their phones in their rooms at night. Parents who did this reported that the most common objections to this rule were: 'I need the alarm' and 'I need music to fall asleep'. The solution: get an old-fashioned battery-operated cheapo alarm, and a Bluetooth speaker that can work over distance."

**Quick Take**: Create clear, consistent technology boundaries and stick to them. Focus on teaching responsible digital citizenship rather than attempting impossible bans.

### Parent Self-Care is Non-Negotiable
The book strongly emphasizes that effective parenting requires parents to care for themselves first. Using the "oxygen mask" principle, the authors show that depleted parents cannot give their children what they need. Self-care isn't selfish—it's essential for sustainable, loving parenting. The Village parents consistently report that they're better parents when they prioritize their own mental health, relationships, and personal needs.

> "You cannot pour from an empty cup."

**Quick Take**: Schedule and protect your self-care time as rigorously as you protect your children's activities. Your well-being directly impacts your parenting capacity.

- "Everything shines in its own time. There is no timetable for life."
