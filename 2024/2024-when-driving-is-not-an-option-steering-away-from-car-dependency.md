# When Driving Is Not an Option: Steering Away From Car Dependency
**Authors**: Anna Letitia Zivarts | **Year**: 2024
**Category**: Science & Nature

## Summary
"One-THIRD OF PEOPLE LIVING IN THE UNITED STATES don't have a driver's license." This statistic reveals a hidden reality about our transportation system: millions of Americans are excluded from the car-dependent world we've built. Written by a low-vision mother who cannot drive, this powerful book exposes how car dependency fails not only those who can't drive but everyone in our communities.

The book reveals that nondrivers include disabled people, low-income individuals, immigrants, seniors aging out of driving, children, and young people choosing not to drive. These marginalized groups bear the brunt of our transportation system's failures while being the least represented in planning decisions. Through personal stories and extensive research, Zivarts demonstrates how building communities around cars has created a crisis of isolation, inequality, and environmental destruction.

Anyone interested in urban planning, disability rights, climate action, or social justice will gain crucial insights into how transportation shapes opportunity and equity. The book offers both a scathing critique of car dependency and a hopeful roadmap for building more inclusive, sustainable communities.

## Core Insights

### One-Third of Americans Can't Drive
The book's central revelation is that approximately 33% of Americans don't have driver's licenses, yet our entire society is built around car ownership. This includes disabled people who cannot physically drive, those who can't afford car ownership, immigrants without documentation, seniors who have aged out of driving, and children. "The truth is, car-dependent communities aren't just failing those of us who can't drive, they are failing everyone."

> "We will only be able to truly transform transportation if we listen to the needs of people who do not have the option to drive."

**Quick Take**: Car dependency isn't just an inconvenience—it's a systemic failure that excludes a third of our population from full participation in society.

### Nondrivers Carry Expertise from System Navigation
People who don't drive spend hours planning routes, waiting for buses, and navigating barriers that drivers never consider. This experience creates valuable expertise about transportation system failures and solutions. "Unlike drivers who can grab the keys and quickly get somewhere, those of us without this privilege have spent hours and hours planning routes, coordinating drivers, waiting for buses, trying to find the most accessible and least unpleasant route to a grocery store."

> "We've thought about what has to change to make things work better for us."

**Quick Take**: The people most affected by transportation problems have the most innovative solutions—they just need to be included in decision-making.

### Transportation Shapes Climate and Health Justice
Car dependency is the largest contributor to carbon emissions, making transportation reform essential for climate action. Beyond climate, car-dominated communities create public health crises through air pollution, noise pollution, and traffic violence that disproportionately harm Black, Brown, and low-income communities. "As the sky turns orange, the storms get stronger, and the waves higher, we are reminded of the immediacy of the threat and the moral prerogative to disrupt failed mobility and land use systems that are locking us into decades of carbon emissions."

**Quick Take**: Transportation justice is climate justice—and both require dismantling car dependency.

### Walkable Communities Are Essential Infrastructure
The book details how missing sidewalks, inaccessible crossings, and gaps in pedestrian networks create impossible barriers for nondrivers. Shockingly, 58% of arterials in Pierce County, Washington lack sidewalks, making basic mobility impossible for wheelchair users and others. "You can't use the bus if you can't get yourself to the bus stop."

**Quick Take**: Sidewalks and pedestrian infrastructure aren't amenities—they're essential civil rights.

### Transit Access Underpins Economic Opportunity
Without reliable transportation options, people lose jobs, education, healthcare, and community connections. The book shows how transportation barriers keep people in poverty and limit life opportunities. "Transportation access underpins everything," explains one expert in the book. When we design communities that require driving, we fundamentally exclude those who cannot drive from economic participation.

**Quick Take**: Transportation isn't just about getting from A to B—it's about accessing life's opportunities and basic human dignity.

## Questions to Consider
- If one-third of Americans can't drive, why are all our communities built around cars?
- How does car dependency in your community exclude disabled, low-income, elderly, or young people?
- What would your daily life look like if you couldn't drive?
- Who makes transportation decisions in your community, and are nondrivers represented?
- How would prioritizing pedestrians and transit change your neighborhood for the better?

## Conclusion
This book is essential reading for anyone who cares about creating more equitable, sustainable, and livable communities. Zivarts masterfully weaves together personal stories, research data, and policy analysis to reveal the hidden costs of car dependency. The book's greatest strength is its hopeful vision for change—centering the expertise of those most excluded by our current system.

The biggest reason to read this book is its power to transform how you see your community. After reading, you'll notice the missing curb ramps, the dangerous crossings, the isolated seniors, and the children who can't get around without rides. But more importantly, you'll understand that these aren't individual problems—they're systemic failures we can fix together.

In a world facing climate crisis and growing inequality, this book offers both a stark warning and a practical roadmap for building communities that work for everyone, regardless of their ability to drive.
