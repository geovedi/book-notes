# Nine Steps to Success
**Authors**: Alan Calder | **Year**: 2024

## Summary
Nine Steps to Success is a practical implementation guide for organizations seeking to achieve ISO 27001:2022 certification and establish robust information security management systems (ISMS). The book presents a proven nine-step methodology developed through extensive real-world implementations across organizations of all sizes and sectors. Calder emphasizes that information security is fundamentally a management discipline, not just a technical challenge, requiring genuine top management support and organizational commitment to create lasting cultural change.

This guide transforms the complex requirements of ISO 27001 into manageable, actionable steps that any organization can follow. It's designed for managers—IT managers, information security managers, or quality managers—tasked with leading ISO 27001 implementation projects who want a clear pathway to successful certification and, more importantly, sustainable information security practices.

## Core Insights

### Step 1: Project Mandate - Establish the Foundation
The implementation journey begins with securing top management commitment and creating a clear project mandate. This step is crucial because successful ISMS implementation requires genuine executive support, not just token approval. The project initiation document (PID) should outline the business case, scope, objectives, and resource requirements while aligning with organizational strategic priorities. The CEO must actively champion the project, understanding that information security is now a governance responsibility that extends far beyond the IT department.

> "Information security has always been an international issue and this version of the Standard reflects continual improvements in the understanding of best practices. It also takes into account the evolution in the cyber threat landscape and allows for a wide range of controls to address risks."

**Quick Take**: Your project's success depends on visible, ongoing executive engagement. Without authentic leadership buy-in, even the most technically sophisticated implementation will fail to achieve lasting organizational change.

### Step 2: Project Initiation - Build the Implementation Framework
This step involves creating detailed project plans, establishing project teams, and defining leadership structures. The project plan should follow the nine-step methodology while remaining flexible enough to accommodate organizational realities. Key elements include selecting appropriate team members, defining roles and responsibilities, establishing communication strategies, and identifying integration opportunities with existing management systems like ISO 9001. The plan should be concise (ideally no more than two pages) but comprehensive enough to guide implementation.

**Quick Take**: Focus on converting potential opponents into allies early, particularly within IT departments that may resist ceding control of security governance to broader management structures.

### Step 3: ISMS Initiation - Define the Management System
During this phase, organizations establish their information security policy, define the ISMS scope, and set up the foundational documentation framework. This includes selecting a continual improvement model, establishing documentation control procedures, and creating the initial management framework. The policy must align with organizational objectives and stakeholder requirements while providing clear direction for security practices. Documentation should follow the four-level approach: policy, procedures, work instructions, and records.

**Quick Take**: Integrate with existing management systems wherever possible to reduce duplication and complexity, treating ISMS as an extension rather than replacement of current governance structures.

### Step 4: Management Framework - Establish Organizational Context
This step involves defining the ISMS scope, identifying organizational context, understanding stakeholder requirements, and establishing information security policies. Organizations must map network flows, define security boundaries, and identify interested parties' requirements. The information security policy must be communicated throughout the organization and made available to interested parties. This framework becomes the foundation for all subsequent risk assessment and control implementation activities.

**Quick Take**: Take care with scoping in large, complex organizations—consider a phased approach with discrete business units rather than creating artificial divisions that certification auditors may reject.

### Step 5: Baseline Security Criteria - Identify Existing Controls
Step five focuses on identifying and assessing existing information security controls that address baseline requirements from legal, regulatory, contractual, and business needs. Most organizations already have numerous security controls in place before beginning ISO 27001 implementation. These must be evaluated for adequacy and incorporated into the ISMS framework. The baseline security criteria create the foundation of required controls that exist regardless of risk appetite or assessment outcomes.

**Quick Take**: Leverage existing compliance requirements (GDPR, PCI DSS, industry regulations) as justification for baseline controls rather than treating them as separate obligations.

### Step 6: Risk Management - Systematic Risk Assessment
This critical step involves establishing a systematic approach to risk assessment, conducting risk analysis, and developing treatment plans. The five-step risk assessment process includes context establishment, risk identification, risk analysis, risk evaluation, and risk treatment. Organizations must define risk acceptance criteria and develop methodologies for assessing likelihood and impact. The output includes a comprehensive risk register and risk treatment plan that guides control selection and implementation.

> "Risk assessment is at the heart of the ISO 27001 approach. The requirement is to implement controls that are appropriate for the organisation, its information security objectives and the identified business, legal, regulatory and contractual requirements."

**Quick Take**: Use risk workshops to engage stakeholders and build organizational understanding while ensuring risk assessments reflect business realities rather than purely technical considerations.

### Step 7: Implementation - Execute the Risk Treatment Plan
The implementation step focuses on putting controls into action, with particular emphasis on staff competencies, awareness programs, and training. This includes addressing skill gaps, developing awareness programs, managing outsourced processes, and ensuring all personnel understand their information security responsibilities. The implementation must address both technical controls (firewalls, encryption, access controls) and administrative controls (policies, procedures, training).

**Quick Take**: Success depends more on people than technology—invest in comprehensive awareness programs and competency development rather than focusing solely on technical solutions.

### Step 8: Measure, Monitor and Review - Establish Oversight
This step establishes the ongoing monitoring, measurement, and review processes that ensure continual improvement. Key activities include implementing internal audit programs, conducting management reviews, monitoring control performance, and tracking ISMS effectiveness. Organizations must establish key performance indicators, conduct regular testing, and create procedures for incident detection and response.

**Quick Take**: Design review processes that provide meaningful insights rather than checkbox compliance—focus on trends, root causes, and improvement opportunities rather than just meeting minimum requirements.

### Step 9: Audit and Certification - External Validation
The final step involves preparing for and undergoing external certification audit. This includes selecting an appropriate certification body, conducting pre-assessment audits, addressing any nonconformities, and maintaining the ISMS for ongoing surveillance audits. The book identifies six secrets to certification success: thorough preparation, experienced auditors, complete documentation, implemented controls, management commitment, and realistic expectations.

**Quick Take**: Choose certification bodies that understand integrated management systems if you're combining ISO 27001 with other standards—avoid auditors who require parallel systems when integrated approaches are more efficient.

## Best Quotes
