## Fast-Track Story Guide

### The Setup
Nathan Underhill is a cryptozoologist funded by the Philadelphia Zoo to create living mythical creatures. After five years and $2.7 million, his gryphon embryo dies horribly—80% necrotic yet still somehow alive. Meanwhile, his wife Grace, a physician, visits elderly patients at the Murdstone Rest Home where residents report strange nocturnal sounds: dragging sacks and screams in the night. One patient, Mrs. Bellman, claims Dr. Zauber is killing residents and grinding their bodies for meat loaf.

### Key Characters
- **Nathan Underhill**: Brilliant but arrogant zoologist obsessed with recreating extinct and mythical creatures
- **Grace Underhill**: Compassionate doctor who serves as the story's moral center
- **Denver**: Their teenage son, rebellious and resentful of his father's eccentric career
- **Dr. Zauber**: Sinister German director of Murdstone Rest Home, secretly a master alchemist
- **Doris Bellman**: Elderly resident whose warnings about the nursing home prove terrifyingly accurate

### The Turning Point
After Doris Bellman dies mysteriously, Nathan begins experiencing nightmares featuring a white-faced man and a horrifying creature covered in black rags—a basilisk. Grace also falls victim to the creature's gaze, falling into a death-like coma. Nathan discovers that Dr. Zauber has succeeded where he failed: not only creating a living basilisk but also breeding a gryphon in the basement of his home in Kraków, Poland.

### The Climax
Nathan, Denver, journalist Patti Laquelle, and Polish scholar Rafał Jasłewicz travel to Poland to confront Dr. Zauber. In a terrifying showdown, they battle the basilisk in Zauber's laboratory. Nathan discovers that the creature's optic fluid—which can kill with a gaze—also contains the cure for its deadly effect. After successfully reviving his companions with the basilisk's fluid, they escape as Zauber's incendiary device destroys his laboratory and all evidence of his monstrous experiments.

### The Resolution
Nathan returns to Philadelphia with the basilisk's optical fluid and successfully revives Grace from her coma. The novel ends with the family reunited and Nathan receiving an ancient alchemical text from Rafał, hinting that his journey into creating mythical creatures may not be over. However, in a chilling final scene, we're reminded that something survived beneath the ruins of the Murdstone Rest Home.
