# Cry Freedom: The Regulatory Assault on Institutional Autonomy in England's Universities
**Authors**: James Tooley with John Drew | **Year**: 2024
**Category**: Philosophy & Critical Thinking

## Summary
James Tooley delivers a powerful critique of how England's higher education regulator, the Office for Students (OfS), has systematically undermined the institutional autonomy that made British universities world-leading. Drawing on his experience as Vice-Chancellor of the University of Buckingham and meticulous legal analysis, Tooley reveals how the OfS has gone far beyond its statutory mandate, contradicting the very legislation that created it.

This urgent warning is essential reading for anyone concerned with academic freedom, university governance, or the future of higher education. Policymakers, university leaders, and education professionals will gain crucial insights into the regulatory overreach threatening one of Britain's greatest success stories.

## Core Insights

### The Seven Freedoms Under Attack
HERA 2017 defined institutional autonomy as seven fundamental freedoms: day-to-day management, course content, teaching methods, staff selection, student admissions, academic freedom, and free speech. Tooley reveals how the OfS has systematically eroded each of these, treating institutional autonomy as merely one consideration among many rather than the protected right Parliament intended. The regulator interprets "have regard to" as meaning they can simply override autonomy when other priorities take precedence, directly contradicting the legislation's clear wording that protecting autonomy must take priority over promoting other goals.

### The Legal Contradiction
The Higher Education and Research Act 2017 explicitly states that the OfS's first duty is to *protect* institutional autonomy, while other duties are merely to *promote* or *encourage* various outcomes. As Tooley argues, "a Mother Bear will protect her cubs, even to the death" – you wouldn't say she "promotes and encourages their survival." Yet the OfS CEO publicly admits they give greater weight to quality concerns than autonomy, revealing a fundamental misunderstanding of their legal obligations.

### The Myth of Public Universities
One of the book's most striking revelations is that all British universities are legally private institutions – yet most have forgotten or denied this fact. As Nick Hillman notes, "all British universities are private, autonomous, independent; pick your word of choice. We do not have a single public university." This legal reality has been obscured by increasing government funding and the corresponding loss of independence that follows.

### The House of Lords' Failed Defense
Tooley documents how the House of Lords vigorously defended institutional autonomy during the passage of HERA 2017, with peers from all parties warning against the dangers of regulatory overreach. Lord Patel warned that "reducing autonomy is linked to lower performance," while Lord Kerslake argued the Bill gave powers "completely incompatible with the principle of institutional autonomy." Despite these warnings and government assurances that autonomy would be protected, the OfS has proceeded with exactly the kind of overreach the Lords feared.

### The Access and Participation Contradiction
The OfS has used equality of opportunity as justification for undermining institutional autonomy, particularly in admissions policies. Yet Tooley demonstrates how this creates absurd situations – universities being told to solve problems in schools that other regulators have failed to fix, while being penalized for taking risks to extend access to marginalized groups. The legislation actually gives the OfS a straight "duty to protect" institutional autonomy in access matters, not merely to "have regard to" it.

### The Quality Conditions Straitjacket
The OfS's "B conditions" relating to quality create perverse incentives that work against educational innovation. Universities are discouraged from admitting students from non-traditional backgrounds who might struggle with continuation or completion metrics, creating exactly the opposite effect of widening participation. The "effectively delivered" requirement subjects teaching methods to regulatory approval, while the Teaching Excellence Framework (TEF) uses subjective assessments to rank universities based on questionable metrics.

### The Call for Resistance
Tooley's most urgent message is that universities must stop acquiescing in the assault on their independence. "That way lies disaster for the universities. It is time we stood up and defended our freedoms." The book concludes with specific recommendations for reform, including eliminating the OfS's power to override Royal Charters and revising regulations that exceed statutory authority.

## Best Quotes
- "University independence has been central to the success of British universities, as has been recognised throughout history, and certainly since the 1960s. Successive governments have been engaged in systematically undermining that independence."
- "The OfS appears to think that 'having regard' to its duties... 'merely means it has to think about them, rather than evidence that it has given weight to the underlying objectives'."
- "It is not unreasonable therefore to take it as a given for this monograph that university independence, the institutional autonomy of higher education institutions, is valuable in itself and for a wide range of economic, moral and philosophical reasons."
- "If you report too much, then your management and governance is in doubt, and so you'll likely get sanctions from the OfS. Too little, and you're going to get sanctions anyway."
- "Academic excellence flows from academic freedom."

## Action Items
- University leaders must challenge OfS overreach and defend their legal rights to institutional autonomy
- Parliament must review the OfS's interpretation of its statutory duties and ensure compliance with HERA 2017
- Students and parents should understand how regulatory overreach affects educational quality and choice
- Taxpayers should question whether regulations designed for publicly-funded universities should apply to independent institutions
- International educators should learn from the British experience to protect academic freedom in their own systems

## Questions to Consider
- If all British universities are legally private institutions, why do they accept regulation designed for public bodies?
- How can universities balance genuine quality assurance with protection of academic freedom and innovation?
- What role should government play in higher education when it provides limited direct funding?
- Can equality of opportunity be achieved without destroying the institutional autonomy that enables educational excellence?
- How might the current regulatory trajectory affect Britain's global university rankings and attractiveness to international students?

## Conclusion
"Cry Freedom" is more than an academic critique – it's an urgent warning about the erosion of one of Britain's greatest assets. Tooley demonstrates convincingly that the OfS has gone far beyond its legal mandate, threatening the very independence that made British universities world-renowned. The book is required reading for anyone who believes that academic freedom and institutional autonomy are essential for educational excellence.

The biggest reason to read this book is its powerful combination of meticulous legal analysis with passionate advocacy for university independence. Tooley not only identifies the problem but provides concrete solutions, making this an essential handbook for defending higher education from bureaucratic overreach. As British universities face unprecedented challenges, this book offers both a diagnosis and a prescription for preserving their fundamental freedoms.
