# To Be a Jew Today
**Authors**: Noah Feldman | **Year**: 2024

## Summary
"To Be a Jew Today" is a profound exploration of contemporary Jewish identity in the 21st century, written by Noah Feldman, a Harvard law professor and intellectual historian. The book tackles the fundamental question of what it means to be Jewish in an era of unprecedented complexity, transformation, and contention. Feldman approaches this question through three major lenses: God, Israel, and the Jewish people as a family-like collective. He argues that Jewish identity has been fundamentally transformed by the existence of the modern state of Israel and that traditional categories of Jewish belief and practice no longer capture the full spectrum of Jewish experience today.

The book is both deeply personal and broadly analytical, drawing on Feldman's own background as a Modern Orthodox Jew who has studied Judaism intensively while engaging with secular intellectual traditions. He rejects the notion of "bad Jews" and instead embraces a capacious, inclusive vision of Jewishness that can accommodate believers, skeptics, Zionists, anti-Zionists, and everyone in between. The work is particularly timely given the ongoing Israel-Palestine conflict and the questions it raises about Jewish identity, responsibility, and future.

This book will benefit anyone seeking to understand contemporary Jewish life, whether they are Jewish themselves trying to navigate their own identity, or non-Jews wanting to grasp the complexities of Jewish experience in the modern world. Readers will gain insight into how Jewish people understand their relationship to God, their connections to Israel, and their sense of collective belonging.

## Core Insights

### The Rejection of "Bad Jews"
Feldman opens with a powerful argument against the concept of "bad Jews" - the idea that some Jews are somehow inauthentic or illegitimate in their Jewishness. He traces this impulse to exclude back to medieval rabbinic responses to mass baptisms, where rabbis developed the principle that "An Israelite, though he has sinned, is an Israelite." This means that even Jews who adopt other religious traditions remain Jews, and wrongdoing doesn't erase Jewish identity.

> "The feeling of being a bad Jew is therefore archetypally Jewish—and simultaneously a misreading of the Jewish way of engaging the world. A Jew can sin and repent, depending on your conception of sin and repentance. A Jew can judge and be judged, regardless of what conception of judging you hold. A Jew should not, however, slot herself or himself into the category of bad Jew."

**Why This Matters**: This inclusive approach opens up space for genuine diversity within Jewish life and allows people to explore different relationships to Jewish tradition without fear of being labeled inauthentic. It's particularly relevant for younger Jews who are experimenting with spiritual practices and identities that might look very different from traditional forms.

**Quick Take**: Your Jewish identity isn't invalidated by doubt, disagreement, or different practices - Jewishness has always been diverse and contested.

### Traditionalism and the God of Black and White
Feldman identifies Traditionalism (often called ultra-Orthodoxy or Haredi Judaism) as one major approach to Jewish belief. Traditionalists believe in a God of absolute authority whose will can be known through an unbroken chain of tradition extending back to Sinai. For them, God's authority is total and comprehensive, covering every aspect of life.

> "Traditionalists want to achieve a state of being that is almost the opposite of our background conditions of freedom and multiplicity. They might want to be free to choose the lives they lead, but that is where the freedom ends."

**Why This Matters**: Traditionalism offers total belonging and comprehensive meaning in a fragmented world, which explains its appeal and growth despite (or because of) modernity's challenges. The Haredi community has grown dramatically since the Holocaust, with major yeshivas now enrolling thousands of students.

**Quick Take**: For those seeking certainty and comprehensive meaning, Traditionalism offers a compelling alternative to modern spiritual fragmentation.

### Israel's Transformative Impact on Jewish Identity
Perhaps Feldman's most innovative argument is that Israel has become an essential, defining component of Jewishness itself - something the state's founders didn't intend. Classical Zionism hoped Israel would replace Jewishness entirely, creating Israelis instead of Jews. Instead, Israel has transformed Jewishness from within.

> "Now, however, Jews outside Israel, wherever they live, find themselves necessarily self-defining in relation to Israel—religiously, spiritually, and politically—whether by support or criticism or some complicated combination of the two."

**Why This Matters**: This explains why Israel has become such a central and often contentious issue in Jewish communal life. For many secular Jews, supporting Israel has become their primary expression of Jewish identity. The Israel question has replaced the Jewish question of the 19th century.

**Quick Take**: Whether you love it, criticize it, or feel conflicted about it, Israel is now inseparable from contemporary Jewish identity.

### Jewish Peoplehood as Family
Feldman proposes understanding the Jewish people as an extended family rather than a nation, race, or religion alone. This family concept accommodates both biological and chosen relationships, acknowledging both deep connection and inevitable conflict within Jewish life.

> "The Jewish people is like an extended family in this sense. You can be born into it. You can be adopted into it. You can join it in a variety of ways. You can have a close or an ambivalent relationship with it. You can also decide to leave it. It might still be your family of origin, and it might still claim you."

**Why This Matters**: The family model explains why Jewish conflicts often feel so intense - they're family disputes. It also accounts for the porous, contested boundaries of Jewish identity and the way Jewish peoplehood combines elements of religion, ethnicity, culture, and kinship.

**Quick Take**: Understanding Jews as a family explains both the intense connections and the passionate conflicts that characterize Jewish communal life.

### A Theology of Struggle and Embrace
Feldman hints at a new theological approach that embraces struggle, contention, and capability as central to Jewish experience. This theology is available to both believers and non-believers, recognizing that wrestling with difficult questions has always been central to Jewish tradition.

> "I hope to uncover some possible answers to forward-looking questions: Would anything be so terrible about a world where there were fewer Jews, or none, provided of course that happened by choice, rather than by coercion or murder?"

**Why This Matters**: This approach allows Jews to engage honestly with difficult questions about Israel, God, and Jewish continuity without predetermined answers. It values the process of struggle itself as authentically Jewish.

**Quick Take**: The questions and struggles are as important as the answers - wrestling with Jewish identity is itself a Jewish practice.

## Best Quotes

- "There are so many ways to be Jewish, so many beliefs and practices and worldviews consistent with sincere and conscientious Jewishness, that we should avoid calling anyone a bad Jew, seriously or even in jest."

- "Traditionalism offers that most elusive, rare phenomenon in our contemporary fragmented world: total, comprehensive belonging in an environment of total, comprehensive belief."

- "Israel did not end Jewish history. But it is, today, essential to Jewishness itself. In the process, Israel has transformed Jewishness into something significantly new and different."

- "All this is, for Traditionalists, warmed by the comforting, nurturing flame of authenticity. For hundreds of years now, since the start of the modern age, self-questioning and self-doubt have informed or defined many people's spiritual lives."

- "The Jewish peoplehood that I seek to describe most closely resembles a large, extended family. It can include aspects of religion, ethnicity, kinship, and culture, but it goes beyond all of these."
