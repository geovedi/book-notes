# Introduction to the New Statistics
**Authors**: Geoff Cumming, Robert Calin-Jageman | **Year**: 2024

## Summary
"Introduction to the New Statistics" revolutionizes how we understand and apply statistical analysis by replacing traditional null hypothesis significance testing (NHST) with an intuitive estimation approach based on confidence intervals and effect sizes. The book presents statistics as the art of drawing reasonable conclusions about the world from limited data, making it accessible and practical for students and researchers across disciplines.

This comprehensive guide is essential for students, researchers, and instructors in psychology, education, health sciences, and any field that relies on statistical inference. Readers will gain confidence in making sound statistical judgments, understanding research findings critically, and adopting Open Science practices that enhance research trustworthiness and replicability.

## Core Insights

### The Estimation Revolution: Beyond NHST
The "new statistics" represents a fundamental shift from traditional null hypothesis significance testing (NHST) to an estimation approach based on confidence intervals (CIs) and effect sizes. Instead of asking "Is there an effect?" researchers ask "How large is the effect?" This approach is more intuitive, easier to understand, and provides more meaningful information for practical applications. For example, when polls report "Support for the President is 68%, with a margin of error of 3%," they're naturally using estimation with confidence intervals—this is exactly how statistical analysis should work.

> "The estimation and NHST approaches are built on the same foundations and often lead to similar conclusions. We believe, however, that the estimation approach is not only easier to learn but also helps researchers make better judgments from their data."

**Quick Take**: Estimation focuses on what we care about most—the size and importance of effects—rather than arbitrary significance thresholds.

### Confidence Intervals: Four Ways to Understand
Confidence intervals can be interpreted in four complementary ways: as a range of plausible values for the population parameter, as indicating the precision of our estimate, as supporting hypothesis testing by examining whether values lie within the interval, and as relating to replication by showing what we might expect in similar studies. This multi-faceted understanding makes CIs far more informative than simple p-values.

> "Support for the President is 68%, in a poll with a margin of error of 3%...we can be reasonably confident that support in the whole population is within 68% ± 3%, which is the 95% confidence interval (CI)."

**Quick Take**: Confidence intervals provide rich information about effect size, precision, and uncertainty all in one intuitive visual display.

### Meta-Analysis: Synthesizing Research Evidence
Meta-analysis combines results from multiple studies to draw quantitative conclusions about a research literature. This approach is essential for evidence-based practice and helps resolve inconsistencies across studies. The book introduces meta-analysis early using forest plots, making complex synthesis accessible without requiring advanced mathematical formulas.

**Quick Take**: Meta-analysis transforms scattered research findings into coherent evidence, helping us understand what the body of research truly tells us.

### Open Science: Research in the Internet Age
Open Science practices increase research trustworthiness by promoting transparency, replication, and sharing. Key practices include preregistration of research plans, sharing data and materials openly, and conducting replications to verify findings. The White House declared 2023 as the Year of Open Science, highlighting its growing importance across scientific disciplines.

> "Open Science emphasizes the stating of research plans and predictions in advance. Then, after you conduct the study, it emphasizes sharing materials, posting data publicly for others to analyze and use, and conducting replications to double-check your own work and the work of others."

**Quick Take**: Open Science prevents bias and increases confidence in research findings by making the entire research process transparent and verifiable.

### Effective Learning: Beyond Rereading and Highlighting
The book incorporates research on effective learning techniques, showing that retrieval practice (testing yourself), distributed practice (spreading study over time), and interleaving (mixing different topics) are far more effective than common strategies like rereading and highlighting. The authors encourage students to "don't read again, retrieve again" and "make it your own."

> "Work at some challenging retrieval to change your brain and get smarter."

**Quick Take**: Effective study techniques involve actively retrieving information and making connections, not passively reviewing material.

## Best Quotes

- "Inferential statistics is an exciting and powerful field! It's how physicians can test a new drug on a limited number of patients and then estimate how well the drug might work for the general public."

- "May all your confidence intervals be short!"

- "Don't fool yourself (DFY) points, in recognition of Richard Feynman's sage advice that 'The first principle is that you must not fool yourself.'"

- "Fixed mindset: The belief that my capabilities are more or less fixed, whatever I do. Growth mindset: The belief that effort, persistence, and using good techniques can help me learn more successfully and become more capable."

- "Open Science is fast becoming mainstream practice...It's basically the old scientific method updated for the Internet age."

## Action Items

- **Adopt Estimation Thinking**: When analyzing data, focus on effect sizes and confidence intervals rather than just p-values
- **Practice Open Science**: Preregister your studies, share your data and materials, and welcome replication attempts
- **Use Effective Learning Techniques**: Replace rereading with retrieval practice, distribute your study sessions, and interleave topics
- **Embrace Meta-Analysis**: Learn to combine results from multiple studies to draw stronger conclusions
- **Develop Statistical Judgment**: Focus on understanding concepts rather than memorizing formulas

## Questions to Consider

- How would your research conclusions change if you focused on estimation rather than significance testing?
- What Open Science practices could you implement in your current research work?
- How might you apply effective learning techniques to improve your statistical understanding?
- What effect sizes in your field are considered practically important versus just statistically significant?

## Conclusion
"Introduction to the New Statistics" is worth your time because it demystifies statistical analysis and presents a more intuitive, informative approach that aligns with how we naturally think about evidence and uncertainty. The biggest reason to read it is that it prepares you for the future of research—where estimation, Open Science, and meta-analysis are becoming the standard across scientific disciplines. Whether you're a student learning statistics for the first time or an experienced researcher looking to update your approach, this book provides the foundation needed to conduct and interpret research in the 21st century.
