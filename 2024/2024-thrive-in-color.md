## Summary
Thrive in Color is a prescriptive career advancement guide designed specifically for professionals of color and underrepresented individuals navigating corporate environments. Drawing from her personal experiences working at major companies like Google, LinkedIn, and Sony Music, as well as her work as CEO and Founder of Brij the Gap Consulting, Devika Brij provides actionable strategies to overcome systemic barriers and achieve career success.

The book addresses the unique challenges faced by professionals of color—including unequal pay, biased leadership, and limited advancement opportunities—while offering concrete frameworks for self-advocacy, professional branding, and strategic career planning. Brij argues that traditional career advice often fails underrepresented professionals because it doesn't account for the systemic biases and cultural dynamics that impact their workplace experiences.

This book is essential for professionals of color feeling stuck in their careers, experiencing workplace bias, or struggling with self-advocacy. It's particularly valuable for those in corporate environments who want to move beyond "playing it safe" and develop the confidence and strategies needed to command recognition, fair compensation, and advancement opportunities.

## Core Insights

### The 3D Cycle of Frustration
The 3D Cycle (Discontentment, Defeat, and Doubt) traps many professionals of color in a pattern of reactive career moves. This cycle begins when you recognize you need more from your career, act with urgency rather than strategy, make poorly planned moves, and end up settling for less than you deserve—only to restart the cycle when dissatisfaction returns.

> "The way to break the 3D Cycle isn't to constantly move from role to role, or from company to company. Instead, taking the time to properly reflect, evaluate options, and present solutions can be a game-changer—not only for your results, but for your overall wellness."

**Quick Take**: Strategic patience beats reactive career moves. Take time to plan rather than escaping discomfort.

### The 60% Rule: Self-Advocacy Drives Success
Research shows that 60% of career success comes from self-advocacy and creating visibility around your contributions, while only 10% stems from actual performance. This revelation challenges the common belief that hard work alone leads to advancement.

> "Studies show that 60 percent of career success hinges on our ability to advocate for ourselves. This is true across the board, including for underrepresented professionals."

**Quick Take**: Your performance matters, but your ability to advocate for yourself matters six times more.

### The CISS Framework: Building Your Professional Brand
The CISS Framework helps professionals develop an authentic personal brand by identifying four key areas:

**Culture Contributors**: The environments and factors that shaped your identity and value system. This includes your upbringing, family expectations, ethnic culture, and life experiences that influence your professional approach.

**Interests**: The activities that energize and fulfill you both inside and outside work. Sharing these helps you seem more human and creates opportunities for alignment with company initiatives.

**Strengths**: Natural qualities and personal attributes that make you effective, such as leadership, problem-solving, or strategic thinking.

**Skills**: Learned abilities acquired through training, education, and experience that are relevant to your role and career advancement.

> "Your lived experiences and the things you love and value are the 'something special' you bring to your company, industry, teams, and clients that can only be offered by you."

**Quick Take**: Your unique background and experiences are not liabilities—they're your greatest professional assets when framed correctly.

### The LSR Method: Communicating Your Value
The LSR Method transforms how you present your accomplishments by focusing on three areas that matter most to leadership:

**Leadership Skills**: How you lead teams, influence decisions, and drive organizational change.

**Scaling Solutions**: How you solve business challenges in ways that can be replicated and expanded across the organization.

**Results**: The concrete outcomes and business impact you deliver, aligned with company objectives.

> "No matter what role you're currently in, communicating the three areas that matter the most to your leaders, and which highlight your skills and strengths, is what will help you stand out consistently."

**Quick Take**: Replace task lists with impact narratives focused on leadership, scalability, and results.

### Putting Yourself First Isn't Selfish
The book challenges generational conditioning that teaches professionals of color to "play it safe," keep their heads down, and be grateful for what they have. Brij argues that strategic self-advocacy isn't selfish—it's necessary for survival and advancement in biased systems.

> "Underrepresented professionals are not only consistently offered unequal pay and passed over for growth opportunities—we consistently accept those things."

**Quick Take**: Setting boundaries and advocating for your needs isn't arrogance—it's professional self-preservation.
