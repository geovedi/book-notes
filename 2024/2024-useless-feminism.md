# Useless Feminism
**Original Title**: Il femminismo inutile
**Author**: Annina Vallarino | **Year**: 2024 

## Summary
"Useless Feminism" is a provocative critique of contemporary neo-feminism, arguing that modern feminist movements have strayed from their original purpose of achieving genuine equality and justice. Vallarino contends that today's feminism often focuses on victimization, marginal issues, and ideological purity rather than addressing the real challenges women face. Through sharp analysis and biting irony, she examines how feminism has transformed into a performance-based ideology that infantilizes women, creates competition between victims, and ultimately undermines female autonomy and progress.

The book speaks to readers concerned about the direction of modern feminist discourse, those uncomfortable with the victim culture in contemporary feminism, and anyone seeking a more nuanced, reality-based approach to gender equality that emphasizes personal responsibility and genuine empowerment over ideological compliance.

## Core Insights

### The New Oppressed: Women Who Have Never Had It Better
Vallarino argues that contemporary feminism has created a paradox where women enjoying unprecedented freedom and opportunity represent themselves as victims of systematic oppression. She notes that even privileged, successful women—celebrities, professionals, and the wealthy—routinely frame themselves as persecuted, creating a universal narrative of female suffering that ignores class differences and actual progress made.

> "In an era where women have conquered rights and recognitions unthinkable only a century ago, we witness a representation of women immersed in a sea of discrimination and oppression."
> _Original: "In un'epoca in cui le donne hanno conquistato diritti e riconoscimenti impensabili solo un secolo fa, assistiamo a una rappresentazione delle donne immerse in un mare di discriminazione e oppressione."_

**Quick Take**: The book challenges us to distinguish between legitimate discrimination and the tendency to interpret any inconvenience as evidence of systemic oppression.

### The Language Obsession: Feminism's Marginal Affairs
Modern feminism's fixation on language and communication, Vallarino argues, distracts from substantive issues. The obsession with terms like "mansplaining," "sexist grammar," and inclusive language represents what she calls "feminism of marginal affairs"—focusing on relatively minor linguistic issues while neglecting more serious problems like workplace safety, economic inequality, and violence against women.

> "Women are not ontologically subordinates who need protection from every offending word, but adults capable of navigating complex social realities."
> _Original: "Le donne non sono ontologicamente delle subordinate, perché capisca che la vita è dura, ma diventa ancora più dura e pure meno divertente se ti fai fermare dall'offesa del primo scemo."_

**Quick Take**: True empowerment requires focusing on substantive barriers to equality rather than policing language and creating safe spaces from ideas.

### Professional Feminism: From Activism to Performance
Vallarino examines how feminism has become a career path and personal brand, with "professional feminists" gaining status through social media performance rather than substantive activism. She argues that this performative feminism prioritizes personal advancement, likes, and followers over meaningful change, turning serious social issues into content for personal branding.

> "The feminist activist has been redefined. While in the past she distinguished herself as an intellectual, journalist or activist, today she emerges primarily as an influencer/entertainer."
> _Original: "La femminista militante si è ridefinita. Mentre in passato si distingueva come intellettuale, giornalista o attivista, oggigiorno emerge innanzitutto come influencer/intrattenitrice."_

**Quick Take**: Social media has transformed feminism from a collective movement for social change into individual performance art.

### The Victim Competition and the Power of Suffering
The book explores how modern feminism has created a competitive marketplace of suffering, where victimhood becomes a source of moral authority and social power. Vallarino argues that this "victim culture" incentivizes fragility rather than resilience, teaching women that their greatest power lies in their capacity to suffer rather than their ability to overcome.

> "The victim is the hero of our time, exonerated from all fault, never an agent, irresponsible, answers for nothing."
> _Original: "La vittima è l'eroe del nostro tempo. Non è mai un agente, è irresponsabile, non risponde di nulla, non ha bisogno di giustificarsi: il sogno di qualsiasi potere."_

**Quick Take**: When suffering becomes status, resilience becomes betrayal of the group, and personal strength threatens collective victim identity.

### Statistical Manipulation and "Rape Culture" Hysteria
Vallarino critically examines how statistics are often manipulated or misinterpreted to support narratives about pervasive violence against women, particularly regarding "rape culture" theories. She argues that while genuine violence exists, the exaggerated claims and broad definitions that include everything from inappropriate comments to violent crimes distort public understanding and undermine efforts to address actual threats.

> "It is abject to deny the tragedy of sexual violence, but it is equally questionable to extend it to all behaviors, because it is another way to minimize it."
> _Original: "Così come è abietto negare la tragedia della violenza sessuale, altrettanto discutibile è estenderla a tutti i comportamenti, perché è un altro modo per minimizzarla."_

**Quick Take**: Accurate understanding of problems requires precise definitions and honest data, not emotional amplification that equates all negative experiences with violent crimes.

### The Sexual Revolution's Unintended Consequences
The book examines how the sexual revolution, while liberating in many ways, left women without traditional protections while expecting them to navigate new freedoms without adequate preparation or support. Vallarino suggests that modern feminism's reluctance to acknowledge biological differences and practical safety concerns has created unrealistic expectations about human behavior and relationships.

> "Women will always be in sexual danger... This message appears unacceptable for younger, more idealistic ears. But for those who have grown up or aspire to, it's like a breath of fresh air—they say an unpleasant truth, but still true."
> _Original: "Le donne saranno sempre in pericolo sessualmente... Questo messaggio appare inaccettabile per le orecchie più giovani e idealiste. Ma per coloro che sono cresciute o che aspirano a farlo, sono come una boccata d'aria fresca—dicono una verità spiacevole, ma pur sempre vera."_

**Quick Take**: Freedom without wisdom is vulnerability; genuine empowerment requires acknowledging both possibilities and limitations.

### The War Between Sexes and Male Demonization
Vallarino documents how contemporary feminism increasingly approaches men as inherently problematic, promoting concepts like "toxic masculinity" that suggest traditional male characteristics require eradication. She argues that this approach damages relationships, creates unnecessary conflict, and ignores the complexity of human nature in favor of ideological simplicity.

> "The feminism of the 21st century should let men find their own voice... We cannot expect men to wait for our lists of how they should be."
> _Original: "Il femminismo del XXI secolo dovrebbe lasciare che gli uomini trovino da sé la loro voce... Dobbiamo permettere agli uomini di autodefinirsi. Non possiamo aspettarci che gli uomini aspettino le nostre liste su come dovrebbero essere."_

**Quick Take**: Healthy relationships between sexes require mutual respect and understanding, not one-sided demands for change and compliance.

## Conclusion

"Useless Feminism" is essential reading for anyone concerned about the current state of feminist discourse and its impact on women's actual progress and autonomy. Vallarino's critique is sharp, well-researched, and challenging—she doesn't hesitate to confront uncomfortable truths about how modern feminism may be undermining the very empowerment it claims to promote.

The book's greatest strength lies in its demand for intellectual honesty and reality-based approaches to gender equality. Vallarino argues persuasively that feminism's future effectiveness depends on rejecting victim culture, embracing resilience, and focusing on substantive rather than symbolic change.

Whether you agree with all her conclusions or not, Vallarino provides a crucial counterweight to dominant feminist narratives and challenges readers to think more critically about the difference between actual empowerment and its performance. This is a thought-provoking work that deserves serious consideration from anyone interested in the future of gender relations and women's rights.
