# 2024-Literary Heterogenesis

**Original Title**: Literary Heterogenesis
**Author**: Noëlle Batt | **Year**: 2024

## Summary

This groundbreaking academic work explores how literary texts emerge through dynamic processes of "heterogenesis" - the generation of difference and novelty through the interaction of heterogeneous elements. Batt bridges literary theory with mathematics, cognitive science, and philosophy to propose a new understanding of literary creation as a diagrammatic process that operates between the virtual and the actual.

The book is essential for scholars, graduate students, and theorists interested in interdisciplinary approaches to literature, cognitive humanities, and the philosophy of creation. It offers a revolutionary framework for understanding how literary meaning emerges through complex dynamic systems, providing readers with sophisticated tools to analyze the morphogenetic processes of artistic creation.

## Core Insights

### The Virtual-Actual Dynamic in Literary Creation

Literary creation operates through a continuous exchange between virtual possibilities and actual text. The "virtual" represents the realm of potential meanings, formal experiments, and heterogeneous assemblages that the writer explores, while the "actual" is the concrete text that emerges. This dynamic is not linear but recursive - the actual text retains traces of virtual exploration, creating a palimpsestic effect where readers can sense the creative process embedded in the final work.

> "Art, always works, with as most real for it, not the actual, but the virtual. [...] The virtual and the actual correspond but do not resemble each other."
> _Original: « L'art, travaille toujours, avec comme plus réel pour lui, non pas l'actuel, mais le virtuel. [...] Le virtuel et l'actuel correspondent mais ne se ressemblent pas. »_

**Quick Take**: Literary texts are not static products but dynamic traces of creative exploration that preserve the memory of their own becoming.

### Differential Heterogenesis: The Mathematics of Literary Innovation

Drawing on mathematical theories of differential heterogenesis developed by Sarti, Citti, and Piotrowski, Batt proposes that literary innovation operates through "mutant forms" and "sensitive bodies" that emerge from differential processes. Just as biological systems generate novelty through variation and selection, literary texts generate new meanings through the differential play of forms, signs, and structures.

This approach reveals how literature creates spaces where conventional linguistic rules can be suspended, allowing for the emergence of new configurations of meaning that operate beyond ordinary discourse.

**Quick Take**: Literary innovation follows mathematical principles of differentiation, creating new forms through systematic play with linguistic and semiotic variables.

### The Diagrammatic Dimension of Literary Texts

Building on Peirce, Deleuze, and Châtelet's work on diagrams, Batt argues that literary texts possess a "diagrammatic dimension" - they function as cognitive artifacts that make visible the operations of thought itself. Unlike simple illustrations, literary diagrams are operative: they actively reconfigure readers' cognitive processes and create new pathways for understanding.

The diagrammatic quality of literature is evident in how writers manipulate linguistic elements (syntax, morphology, phonology) to create "dispositifs" that simultaneously show and say, making readers experience the thought processes behind the text.

**Quick Take**: Literature functions as a diagram of thought, making visible the invisible operations of cognition and meaning-making.

### Loose Connectedness and Creative Plasticity

Drawing on von Foerster's theorem and Atlan's work on "order from noise," Batt demonstrates that literary creativity thrives on "loose connectedness" - the strategic use of ambiguity, indeterminacy, and semantic gaps that invite reader participation. Unlike pragmatic language, which prioritizes clear communication, literary language maintains productive tensions between elements, allowing for multiple interpretations and ongoing semantic generation.

This principle explains why effective literature often employs deliberate obscurity, fragmentation, and contradiction - these are not flaws but features that enable the text's creative vitality.

**Quick Take**: Literary texts balance order and chaos, maintaining just enough ambiguity to engage readers as co-creators of meaning.

### The Role of Indeterminacy in Artistic Creation

Batt explores how various forms of indeterminacy - from Peirce's "vagueness" to Ingarden's "spots of indeterminacy" - function as catalysts for creative thinking. Rather than representing deficiencies, these gaps and ambiguities create spaces where imagination can operate, allowing both writers and readers to participate in meaning-making.

The book shows how literary techniques like ellipsis, metaphor, and paradox harness indeterminacy to create what Valéry called "orderly disorder" - systems that maintain both structure and openness.

**Quick Take**: Indeterminacy is not a bug but a feature of literary art, creating the conditions necessary for creative thought and reader engagement.

## Best Quotes

- "The work of the poet or novelist is not so utterly different from that of the scientific man. The artist introduces a fiction; but it is not an arbitrary one; it exhibits affinities to which the mind accords a certain approval in pronouncing them beautiful."
  _Charles S. Peirce_

- "Considering the enormous diversity of the surrounding material and mental objects, the main problem any creator has to face when composing a text or an artistic piece is first, that of selecting the elements the artist wants to invest in the work, then combining, articulating them, bridging the gaps among all elements."

- "Literature speaks about language while speaking about other things, does not speak about other things except by speaking about language."
  _Jacques Roubaud_

- "What I try to translate to you is more mysterious, intertwining with the very roots of being, with the impalpable source of sensations."
  _Cézanne, cited by J. Gasquet_

- "The more rigidly and univocally the elements of a system are connected at the local level, the less influential they will be on the global system's behavior."
  _von Foerster's conjecture_

## Action Items

- **Analyze literary texts as dynamic systems** rather than static artifacts, looking for traces of virtual exploration in the actual text
- **Identify diagrammatic operations** in literary works - how formal arrangements create cognitive effects that go beyond mere content
- **Embrace productive ambiguity** in both reading and writing, recognizing that indeterminacy creates space for creative thought
- **Study interdisciplinary connections** between literary theory and mathematics, cognitive science, and philosophy of mind
- **Practice close reading** that attends to infra-semantic levels (phonology, morphology, syntax) as carriers of meaning alongside content

## Questions to Consider

- How might understanding literature as a dynamic process rather than a static product change our approach to literary analysis and education?
- What role should reader participation play in meaning-making, and how does this relate to concepts like "reader-response theory"?
- How can digital humanities tools help us visualize and analyze the diagrammatic dimension of literary texts?
- What are the ethical implications of viewing literature as a cognitive system that actively shapes readers' thinking processes?
- How might this framework apply to other art forms and creative practices beyond literature?

## Conclusion

"Literary Heterogenesis" represents a significant contribution to literary theory and interdisciplinary humanities scholarship. Batt successfully bridges continental philosophy, analytic semiotics, and cognitive science to create a comprehensive framework for understanding literary creativity as a dynamic, morphogenetic process.

While the book's interdisciplinary approach and theoretical density may challenge some readers, those willing to engage with its complex arguments will be rewarded with powerful new tools for understanding how literature creates meaning through difference, dynamism, and diagrammatic operations. The framework offers particularly valuable insights for digital humanities, cognitive literary studies, and anyone interested in the philosophy of artistic creation.

The biggest reason to read this work is its revolutionary reconceptualization of literary texts not as mere containers of meaning but as active cognitive systems that participate in the generation of new ways of thinking and being. In an era of increasing interdisciplinary collaboration, Batt's work provides a model for how literary studies can engage productively with mathematics, cognitive science, and philosophy while maintaining the unique insights that literary art provides into human experience.
