## The Story

### The Miracle Baby
Three months after giving birth, Isla is exhausted but overjoyed to be raising Ruby—the first bear shifter baby born in years. Ruby presents unique challenges: she shifts randomly between human baby and bear cub forms, can only nurse when human, and is the key to the survival of their species. Isla's four mates—alpha Torben, playful Húnn, once-grumpy Ràn, and gentle Finn—all share parenting duties, creating a loving polyamorous family where biological paternity doesn't matter.

### The Supernatural Threat
The Fates—ancient deities who control destiny—reappear with cryptic warnings about Ruby being "ursine" and needing their protection to survive. This supernatural interference terrifies Isla, who just wants a normal life with her family. Meanwhile, the bear shifters must deal with the aftermath of their previous battle against feral bears, all while trying to understand Ruby's unique abilities and what her existence means for their future.

## Best Quotes
> "I never thought I'd ever be a mother. Not in this world. I never planned on having children. The Drowning destroyed so many lives and if I'm honest, I'm still worried that it might happen again. Having children in this environment seems like a stupid thing to do. Still, when I look at her, I don't regret it in the slightest."

> "She's a miracle. My own, personal miracle. If the bear community knew about her, she'd be their miracle as well. The first bear shifter baby in years. She doesn't know it yet, but she's the future of our people."

> "I've never loved anyone as much as I love her, not even my mates. It's a different kind of love, one so deep that there are no words to describe it. An all-encompassing, unconditional love."

> "All I want is to be happy with my men and my daughter. No prophecies, no evil trying to take over the world. Just my small, loving family."
