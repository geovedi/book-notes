## Core Strategies & Frameworks

### The Foundation: Understanding Stocks
Stocks represent ownership in companies - you're buying a piece of businesses you believe in. Think of it like pizza slices: if a company has 1 million shares and you own 1,000, you own 0.1% of that company. There are two main types of stocks: growth stocks (fast-growing companies like tech firms that reinvest profits for expansion) and income stocks (established companies that pay regular dividends to shareholders).

> "A stock is simply put a piece of a company. A stock represents ownership and is an asset you can buy."
**Quick Take**: You don't need thousands to start - single shares of companies like Coca-Cola ($46) or Nike ($60) are accessible starting points.

### The Two Main Wealth-Building Methods
**1. Capital Gains**: Buy stocks at one price and sell them at a higher price. If you buy 100 shares at $50 and sell at $60, you make $1,000 profit (minus fees). This requires market timing and analysis but can generate quick returns.

**2. Dividends**: Receive regular payments from established companies. For example, Coca-Cola pays $0.37 quarterly per share. Own 100 shares, and you receive $37 every quarter. The magic happens through dividend reinvestment and compounding over time.

> "With dividends it's more of a Snowball Effect. In the beginning your income is low, but after time it exponentially increases allowing you to live off your dividend income without you ever having to sell your stocks."
**Quick Take**: Start dividend investing early, reinvest payments, and choose companies that consistently increase dividends faster than inflation.

### Market Navigation Strategy
The stock market is simply a marketplace where buyers and sellers trade shares, just like a car dealership but for company ownership. The two major US exchanges are NYSE (traditional floor trading) and NASDAQ (fully electronic). Markets go through cycles: bull markets (upward trends during prosperity) and bear markets (downward trends during economic hardship).

**Market Crash Survival Plan**: During crashes, don't panic sell. Instead, practice dollar-cost averaging (investing fixed amounts regularly regardless of market conditions) to buy quality stocks at discounted prices. Market crashes have happened before and markets always recover - use these opportunities to buy great companies at 40-60% discounts.

### Investment Account Types
**401(k)**: Employer-sponsored retirement plans, often with company matching (free money!). Contribution limits are higher but investment options are limited to what your employer chooses.

**IRA/Roth IRA**: Individual retirement accounts you control. Lower contribution limits but complete freedom to choose any investment. Roth IRAs offer tax-free growth, traditional IRAs offer tax-deductible contributions.

**Traditional Brokerage Account**: Most flexible option with no withdrawal penalties, but you'll pay capital gains taxes on profits. Great for beginners who want to experiment with small amounts.

> "Opening an account is also, really easy. Just head over to the investment website and click on the 'open Account' button or you can also call them and they will eagerly help you in opening your account."
**Quick Take**: Start with a small amount in a traditional brokerage account to learn, then add retirement accounts as you grow more confident.

## Best Quotes
- "Investing to get rich and wealthy should be your long-term goal."
- "When you purchase a stock or share, you are buying ownership in a company."
- "The beauty of this is that you do not perform any physical labor it's all passive."
- "Write down your goals. If you don't know where you are going, there is no need to even get started."
- "The earlier you start investing, the faster will not only your money grow, but you'll also be able to retire quicker."

## Action Items
- Open a brokerage account this week (Ally, E-Trade, or TD Ameritrade are recommended starting points)
- Start with $100-500 in an individual stock you understand (like a company whose products you regularly use)
- Set up automatic monthly investments of at least $25-50 to practice dollar-cost averaging
- Research and add 2-3 dividend-paying stocks to your watchlist
- Read annual reports (10-K) of companies before investing your first $1,000
- Create simple investment rules (e.g., "I will only invest in profitable companies I understand")

## Questions to Consider
- What are your specific financial goals, and what timeline are you working with?
- How much risk can you realistically handle without panic-selling during market downturns?
- Are you more drawn to rapid growth (technology stocks) or steady income (dividend stocks)?
- Do you want to actively manage investments or prefer a passive approach with index funds?
- What amount of money can you consistently invest each month without affecting your lifestyle?
