# How to Develop a Profitable Trading Strategy
**Authors**: Heikin Ashi Trader | **Year**: 2018

## Summary
This book challenges conventional trading wisdom by advocating for doing the opposite of what most traders and trading books recommend. The author presents a counterintuitive approach: instead of following the traditional "cut losses and let profits run" mantra, he suggests traders should aim for small, consistent profits while accepting larger, infrequent losses. The core philosophy is that markets are mostly in mean-reversion mode rather than trending, making it difficult to achieve the large price targets that traditional strategies require.

The book is ideal for day traders and short-term traders who have struggled with conventional high risk-reward ratio strategies. It offers a practical alternative focused on psychological comfort through high win rates and consistent small gains rather than the stress of frequent losses and occasional big wins.

## Core Insights

### Do the Opposite of What Trading Books Teach
The author systematically debunks three sacred trading rules: 1) "Cut your losses and let your profits run" - this works for trend followers but fails in day trading where markets are mostly mean-reverting; 2) "Achieve good risk-reward ratios" - targets like 1:2 or 1:3 are rarely achievable in short-term trading; 3) "You only need a 33.33% hit rate" - this mathematical requirement ignores real market behavior where stops are hit more often than targets.

**Quick Take**: Most trading advice comes from trend followers who operate on different timeframes and market assumptions than day traders.

### Aim for High Hit Rates with Small Targets
The author advocates for a scalping approach where traders target small profits (2-3 ticks) while using wide stops (20-100 ticks). This seemingly negative risk-reward ratio (risking 6-50 times what you aim to win) is offset by extremely high hit rates (75-95%). The psychology is simple: humans prefer frequent small wins over occasional large wins amid frequent losses.

**Quick Take**: High hit rates create positive psychological momentum and make trading sustainable long-term.

### Use Automated Take-Profit Orders
The author strongly recommends automating profit-taking through take-profit orders. This removes greed and emotional decision-making from the equation. Since small targets are reached quickly (often within 5-30 minutes), traders can focus their energy on managing the few losing trades rather than worrying about winners.

**Quick Take**: Automate your wins to free up mental capacity for managing losses.

### Embrace Semi-Automatic Trading
The optimal approach combines automated entries and take-profits with discretionary loss management. Computers handle routine execution better than humans, while experienced traders are better than computers at recognizing when a losing trade should be closed early to minimize damage.

**Quick Take**: Let robots handle routine tasks, apply human intelligence where it matters most.

## Action Items
- Test any strategy thoroughly with backtesting before risking real money
- Focus on achieving high hit rates (75%+) rather than high risk-reward ratios
- Use automated take-profit orders to remove emotion from winners
- Set wide stops that are unlikely to be hit under normal market conditions
- Consider semi-automatic trading: automate entries and exits, manage losses manually
- Track your performance metrics: hit rate, average trade, profit factor, drawdowns

## Questions to Consider
- What is your natural trading personality? Do you prefer frequent small wins or occasional big wins?
- Are you willing to risk looking "irrational" by using negative risk-reward ratios?
- Can you handle the psychology of taking many small profits instead of hoping for big moves?
- Do you have the discipline to close losing trades early when automated systems wouldn't?
- How will you manage the large but infrequent losses that this strategy inevitably produces?

## Conclusion
This book offers a genuinely contrarian approach that challenges deeply ingrained trading beliefs. While the strategy may seem counterintuitive, the backtest results are compelling, showing hit rates of 80-95% with steady equity curves. The author's main contribution isn't a specific strategy but a framework for thinking differently about trading success.

The biggest reason to read this book is if you've struggled with traditional trend-following approaches and high risk-reward ratio strategies. It provides a psychologically sustainable alternative that aligns with human nature's preference for frequent wins over frequent losses. However, be aware that this approach requires significant capital to weather the occasional large losses, and success still depends on proper implementation and risk management.
