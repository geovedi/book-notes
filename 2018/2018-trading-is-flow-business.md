# Trading is Flow Business
**Authors**: Heikin Ashi Trader | **Year**: 2018

## Summary
"Trading is Flow Business" is Part 4 of the "Scalping is Fun!" series, revealing that successful scalping isn't about complex analysis but about timing, psychology, and achieving a state of "flow" during optimal market conditions. The book challenges traditional trading wisdom by arguing that rapid, momentum-based scalping outperforms carefully planned trades.

Active traders who struggle with over-analysis and inconsistent results will discover a practical framework for identifying prime trading windows, maintaining discipline, and scaling position sizes dynamically based on performance.

## Core Insights

### 1. Only Trade When It's Fun
The most successful traders treat trading like a casino—they control when and how they play, not the other way around. Trading should be enjoyable and engaging, not a chore born of boredom or compulsion. The author warns against "trading out of boredom," where traders sit in front of screens for hours making pointless trades, which is often the precursor to addiction.

> "Fun at the right time is an effective means against the risk of trading and overtrading out of boredom for me."

**Quick Take**: If you're not enjoying the trading session and the market conditions aren't clear, step away. Your best trading happens when strategy aligns with optimal market conditions.

### 2. Master the Trading Calendar
Knowing when NOT to trade is more important than knowing when to trade. Avoid bank holidays (especially in UK and US), Friday afternoons (due to weekend gaps), market open/close moments, and Asian sessions unless you specialize there. The hours before major economic news releases are particularly dangerous.

> "Successful traders know especially when you should not trade. Perhaps this is the most important trading rule at all."

**Quick Take**: Use economic calendars like ForexFactory.com and avoid trading during low-volume periods or before major news announcements.

### 3. Trade During Peak Volatility Sessions
For Forex traders, the London session (40.9% of global volume) and the London-US overlap (08:00-11:00 EST) offer the best liquidity and smallest spreads. Index traders should focus on morning sessions for European indices and adjust when US traders enter. Oil traders thrive during prime time (08:50-10:30 EST) but avoid the first minute of New York open.

> "The London session represents the most important hours of trading in international currency trading. As a trader, here you will find the best liquidity in all traded currency pairs."

**Quick Take**: Concentrate your trading energy during peak volatility hours when your strategies have the highest probability of success.

### 4. Speed Over Analysis
Traditional "plan the trade, trade the plan" wisdom fails because markets behave like a surreal city where streets and buildings change location daily. Technical analysis and indicators are based on past data and provide false security in an inherently uncertain environment. The key is developing quick reflexes and experimental flexibility rather than perfect predictions.

> "When trading you always remain an amateur, no matter how many decades 'experience' you have."

**Quick Take**: Focus on rapid decision-making and immediate reaction to market movements rather than attempting to predict future direction.

### 5. Flow State Trading
Flow is a psychological state where you're fully immersed, acting effortlessly without fear or expectation of profit. In trading flow, you respond instinctively to market movements, closing positions decisively whether profitable or losing. This state occurs naturally during high-volatility periods with clear, unambiguous movements.

> "My formula for success is therefore: Flow - Fun - success!"

**Quick Take**: Seek trading environments that enable flow state—high volatility, clear patterns, and minimal distractions—where you can act without overthinking.

### 6. Dynamic Position Management
Good traders scale their position size based on current performance: increase size during winning streaks, reduce during losses. Simple rules work best: after two consecutive losses, halve your position size. After seven consecutive wins, consider increasing size. The key is aggressive when winning, defensive when losing.

> "Good scalpers know when it's time to turn on the turbo concerning their position size and when not."

**Quick Take**: Implement simple, clear position sizing rules that you can follow instantly during fast market conditions.

## Conclusion

"Trading is Flow Business" offers a refreshing counter-narrative to traditional trading education. While many books emphasize complex analysis and careful planning, this guide advocates for speed, timing, and psychological flow. The author's personal experiences—including a 28-trade winning streak and 15 consecutive losses—ground the advice in real-world trading reality.

This book is worth your time if you're an active trader who struggles with over-analysis, inconsistent discipline, or timing issues. The biggest takeaway is that trading success comes not from perfect predictions but from perfect timing—knowing when to engage aggressively and when to stay completely out of the market. The flow-based approach may seem counterintuitive, but for traders who can master their psychology and timing, it offers a path to consistent profitability.
