# Managing Cybersecurity Risk
**Authors**: Jonathan Reuvid (Editor) | **Year**: 2018

## Summary
Managing Cybersecurity Risk is a comprehensive wake-up call for business leaders who haven't recognized their vulnerability to cyber attacks or taken appropriate action to address cyber risk. This second edition focuses heavily on the human factor, emphasizing that cybersecurity is fundamentally a people issue, not just a technical one. The book provides practical frameworks for building cyber resilience, with special attention to GDPR compliance and the role of boardroom leadership.

This essential guide is perfect for SMEs, board directors, and senior managers who need to transform their cybersecurity approach from reactive to proactive. Readers will gain actionable insights on building a human firewall, understanding criminal motivations, and creating a culture of security awareness that goes beyond annual training exercises.

## Core Insights

### Building Business Resilience Through Human Factors
The core insight that transforms cybersecurity thinking: 90% of successful cyber attacks succeed due to human error, not technical failures. Organizations must shift from viewing staff as "weakest links" to recognizing them as their most powerful defense when properly trained and engaged. Traditional annual security e-learning is ineffective—lasting behavioral change requires continuous, relevant education that speaks the business language and tells compelling stories.

> "Confidence, after all, is not a measure of technological systems, but of the people who are entrusted to manage them." — Tom Farley, President of New York Stock Exchange

**Quick Take**: Invest in storytelling-based security training that resonates with employees' daily work experiences rather than generic technical warnings.

### Understanding Cyber Criminal Motivations
Cyber criminals make money through four primary methods: extortion (ransomware), fraud (deception), theft (data stealing), and unauthorized use (resource hijacking). Understanding these motivations helps organizations identify vulnerabilities and implement targeted defenses. Criminals use sophisticated psychological tricks but their end goals remain predictable—they want quick financial gain with minimal risk.

> "So by understanding how cyber criminals make money and the psychological tricks they employ, we can identify the gaps and risks in our systems, raise awareness and put in place more effective security controls."

**Quick Take**: Map your security controls directly to the four criminal methods rather than trying to defend against every possible technical attack vector.

### Boardroom Leadership and Risk Appetite
Cybersecurity cannot be delegated to IT departments alone—boards must actively lead by defining clear risk appetite and ensuring cyber resilience forms a key part of business strategy. Only 33% of boards have clearly set out their cyber risk appetite, leaving organizations vulnerable to "sleepwalking" into crises rather than preventing them.

> "Every organisation is learning how to best secure their assets in an ever-evolving threat landscape. Engaging every single employee in that process is crucial to creating integrated, effective and proactive defences."

**Quick Take**: Boards should regularly discuss cyber risk with documented minutes showing informed decisions about cybersecurity strategy and investment.

### The Human Firewall Approach
Creating an active "human firewall" requires moving beyond awareness to actual behavioral change. This means focusing on Awareness, Behaviors, and Culture (the "ABC" components) through interactive training, peer-to-peer learning, and leadership champions. Security culture change happens one conversation and one behavior at a time until a tipping point is reached.

> "Security culture change is not a monolithic phenomenon – it can't happen all at once and there is no silver bullet – it happens one conversation and one behaviour at a time."

**Quick Take**: Implement a "champions" campaign where employees become security advocates within their teams, creating peer-to-peer accountability.

### GDPR as a Catalyst for Better Security
While General Data Protection Regulation compliance is crucial, it should not become a tick-box exercise that distracts from broader cybersecurity needs. Organizations that focus only on GDPR compliance risk having excellent regulatory processes while neglecting actual cyber defenses that protect customers.

> "There is a real risk that companies could end up with excellent GDPR compliance but will have neglected their cyber defences and ultimately exposed their customers to greater risk."

**Quick Take**: Use GDPR requirements as an opportunity to improve overall data management and customer trust, not just to avoid regulatory penalties.

## Best Quotes

- "Cyber risk is a systemic challenge and cyber resilience is a public good. Without security and resilience in our networks, it will be impossible to safely take advantage of the innumerable opportunities that the Fourth Industrial Revolution is poised to offer." — Daniel Dobrygowski, World Economic Forum

- "Baroness Dido Harding, the outgoing CEO of TalkTalk, called cybercrime 'the crime of our generation' when she was thrust into the media gaze following their high-profile breach in October 2015."

- "The great majority — estimated to be 90 per cent — of successful cyberattacks succeed because of human error. That means anyone in any organisation, irrespective of their role or seniority, can enable an attack to succeed through their unwitting actions."

- "Staff are not, as is so often lazily reported, 'our weakest link'. They are instead our most powerful and effective defence against attacks and only as 'weak' as the strength of the awareness training we give them."

- "Cybersecurity is NOT simply a technical issue, it's fundamentally also a people issue."

- "People are the solution: they want to be a safe pair of hands and they want to protect the people and things that matter to them."

## Action Items

- **Conduct a human risk assessment**: Identify where employee behaviors could enable the four criminal methods (extortion, fraud, theft, unauthorized use)

- **Implement storytelling-based training**: Replace generic security awareness with real scenarios relevant to your specific business context

- **Establish board-level cyber risk governance**: Define clear risk appetite and ensure regular board discussions with documented decisions

- **Create security champions program**: Identify and train advocates across departments to promote security culture

- **Map GDPR compliance to security outcomes**: Ensure regulatory requirements translate into actual protective measures rather than just paperwork

- **Test your resilience regularly**: Conduct realistic cyber incident simulations to understand preparedness beyond theoretical plans

## Questions to Consider

- How much does your current cybersecurity approach rely on technology versus human factors?

- What stories do you tell about security in your organization, and are they making an impact?

- Does your board truly understand cyber risk, or is it treated as a technical issue delegated to IT?

- Are your security policies creating behaviors that protect the business or just checking compliance boxes?

- How would your organization respond if 90% of your technical defenses failed but your people were prepared?

## Conclusion
Managing Cybersecurity Risk is absolutely worth your time if you're a business leader who treats cybersecurity as an IT problem rather than a business resilience challenge. The book's biggest strength is its relentless focus on the human element and practical strategies for building a security culture that actually works.

The most compelling reason to read this book is its transformation of cybersecurity from a technical discussion to a business strategy conversation. By understanding that 90% of breaches succeed due to human error, leaders can redirect resources from purely technical solutions to building resilient people and processes. The actionable frameworks for board leadership, human firewall development, and GDPR integration make this an essential guide for any organization serious about cybersecurity in the digital age.

The practical examples, real-world case studies, and focus on storytelling as an educational tool make complex concepts accessible and immediately applicable. Whether you're a board member, senior executive, or IT leader trying to build business case for security investments, this book provides the language and frameworks to make cybersecurity everyone's responsibility.
