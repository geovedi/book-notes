### Niche Selection and Market Research
The foundation of e-commerce success lies in choosing the right niche. The book emphasizes selecting a niche that balances personal passion with commercial viability. Use Google Trends and keyword analysis tools to evaluate market demand and competition levels. Look for niches with at least 500 monthly searches but avoid overly competitive markets dominated by major retailers.
