## Part I: Asking for Help Is the Worst

### It Makes Us Feel Bad

The discomfort associated with asking for help is a common experience that affects many of us. Research conducted by scientists reveals that the emotional pain triggered by seeking assistance can be just as significant as physical pain. It's no wonder we find ourselves grappling with unease when faced with the prospect of reaching out for support.

Ironically, our well-intentioned but often clumsy attempts at asking for help can backfire, making people less inclined to offer assistance. Our hesitance and reluctance to seek help often result in missed opportunities for the support and resources we need. It's a self-perpetuating cycle where our aversion to asking for help hinders our ability to access the assistance that could alleviate our challenges.

To become more adept at asking for help, it is crucial to grasp the concept of reinforcements. These subtle cues and signals motivate individuals to collaborate and support us. By understanding the power of reinforcements, we unlock a world of potential where many helpful individuals stand ready to come to our aid.

Once we comprehend how these reinforcements operate, we can harness their influence and rally a collective force of supportive people. These reinforcements can be found in the form of friends, colleagues, and acquaintances who are eager to lend a helping hand. By recognising and embracing the subtle cues that encourage collaboration and assistance, we open ourselves up to an army of potential allies, ready to step in and provide the support we need.

So, while asking for help may initially stir feelings of discomfort, we can transform the process into one that feels empowering and fruitful by understanding and utilising the dynamics of reinforcements. As we become more skilled in seeking assistance and recognise the cues that inspire collaboration, we can foster a network of supportive individuals motivated to ride to our rescue whenever we require help.

### We Assume Others Will Say No

Help seekers often underestimate the likelihood of receiving the assistance they seek, which is quite encouraging. The reality is that people are far more inclined to help us than we tend to assume. This revelation offers a glimmer of hope for those seeking support.

For many individuals, saying "no" can be an incredibly challenging and uncomfortable experience. Once we have declined a request, we become even less likely to say "no" a second time. The psychological concept of cognitive dissonance plays a role here. We naturally tend to maintain a positive self-perception, viewing ourselves as helpful and kind individuals. Once we have said "yes" to someone's request, our desire to align our actions with this self-perception drives us to continue saying "yes" rather than changing our response.

This phenomenon, known as the "foot-in-the-door" technique, offers further good news for those seeking help. People are more inclined to say "yes" once they have already agreed to help, which is beneficial for those seeking assistance. Initial success in obtaining someone's support can pave the way for continued aid.

So, if you need help, accept that people are generally more willing to lend a hand than you might believe. Understanding the dynamics of cognitive dissonance and the tendency to maintain a positive self-image can work in your favour. Remember that the initial "yes" can create a foundation for ongoing support. Embrace the optimism that comes with realising that your chances of receiving help are often more significant than you assume.

### We Assume Asking for Help Makes Us Less Likable

Receiving help often evokes a complex mix of emotions within us. As a result, we tend to assume that asking for help will diminish our likability or competence in the eyes of others. However, research reveals that helpers develop a greater fondness for the individuals they have assisted.

Interestingly, helping others also benefits the helper in various ways. It can elevate our moods, instil a sense of warmth and positivity, and make the world slightly better. When we extend our willingness to help, it benefits the recipient and enhances our well-being and overall outlook on life.

Understanding these dynamics should alleviate some of the discomforts we may feel when asking for help. While reaching out for assistance may initially fill us with dread, it's essential to recognise that asking in the right way presents an opportunity for others to experience genuine satisfaction and feel good about themselves. Inviting others to help creates a meaningful opportunity for them to contribute and make a positive impact.

Therefore, rather than assuming that asking for help diminishes our likability or competence, we should embrace the fact that it allows others to feel genuinely good about themselves and fosters a deeper connection between us. It opens doors for mutual support, shared growth, and building strong, authentic relationships. So, let go of any reservations or discomfort and embrace the positive outcomes of asking for help correctly.

## Part II: How to Ask Anyway

### The Inherent Paradox in Asking for Help

The act of seeking help involves navigating a challenging paradox. While research reveals that being helpful brings numerous psychological benefits and elicits a strong sense of fulfilment in the helpers, these positive effects diminish when assistance feels forced or obligatory.

Commonly employed influence tactics, such as using prefaces like "Can I ask you a favour?" before making a request, increase the likelihood of receiving help. However, they come with a trade-off. These tactics can evoke feelings of being trapped or coerced, decreasing the quality or quantity of assistance provided.

Reciprocity seems like a straightforward solution: I help you, you help me, and both parties walk away feeling satisfied. However, even accepting help from others can trigger a sense of being controlled, creating a perceived debt or obligation towards the person who offered assistance.

This complexity poses a challenge for help seekers. It's not necessarily bad news but rather a nuanced reality that requires careful consideration. The desire to receive assistance while maintaining a sense of autonomy and avoiding feelings of indebtedness adds another layer of complexity to the intricate dynamics of asking for help.

Navigating this paradox calls for finding a delicate balance. It fosters an environment where help is willingly offered rather than coerced or expected. Genuine connections, built on mutual respect and understanding, can help alleviate concerns of control or indebtedness. By cultivating relationships based on trust and goodwill, both parties can engage in acts of assistance and support with a sense of authenticity and shared fulfilment.

So, while the inherent paradox of seeking help may present complications, it also invites us to explore new ways of fostering collaborative relationships and genuine connections. Recognising the intricacies allows us to navigate the complexities with empathy and consideration, ultimately building a foundation for more meaningful and mutually beneficial interactions.

### The Four Steps to Getting the Help You Need

To effectively secure the help you need from others, remember four key steps. These steps can significantly enhance your chances of receiving the assistance you seek, ensuring a smoother process and more successful outcomes.

The first step involves making your need visible to others. It's essential to understand that people generally pay less attention to you than you might assume. They have their concerns and preoccupations. Therefore, you must find ways to bring your need to their attention, whether through clear communication, expressing vulnerability, or seeking opportunities to share your challenges. By actively ensuring that others know your market, you increase the likelihood of them recognising and offering support.

The second step is to convey that you genuinely welcome the help others could provide. Many people are aware that unrequested help can sometimes be met with resentment. You must communicate your openness and willingness to receive assistance to overcome this perception. Make it clear that you genuinely want help and value the contributions others can offer. This reassurance creates a safe space for potential helpers to step forward and show their support without hesitation.

Next, ensuring that the potential helper takes on a sense of responsibility for assisting is crucial. This step is vital when seeking help from a large group or addressing multiple recipients through platforms like email. By clearly articulating why you are reaching out to them specifically and emphasising their unique ability to help, you make it more apparent why they should be your helper. Providing context and personalised requests increase the likelihood of individuals feeling a sense of duty and obligation to lend their support.

Lastly, it's vital to recognise that your need is not the only priority in your potential helper's life. People have their commitments, responsibilities, and limitations. While your initial request may not be feasible for them to fulfil, remaining open-minded and flexible is crucial. Be receptive to alternative ways in which they may offer assistance. By displaying understanding and flexibility, you demonstrate that you value their willingness to help, even if it doesn't align precisely with your initial request. This openness fosters a collaborative environment and allows for creative problem-solving.

Following these four steps can significantly enhance your chances of receiving the help you need. Making your need visible, expressing your openness to assistance, clarifying the responsibility of the potential helper, and remaining flexible in the face of other commitments all contribute to fostering a supportive network where individuals are more likely to step up and offer the help you require.

### Don't Make It Weird

Asking for help is a delicate art, as it involves what you say and do and what you consciously or unconsciously avoid saying or doing. Navigating this terrain carefully is essential to prevent unintentionally alienating the people you need assistance from.

Certain behaviours and communication patterns can make the situation awkward or uncomfortable for both parties. Apologising excessively, using disclaimers, downplaying the significance of your request, or reminding others of any favours they may owe you are common pitfalls that can inadvertently strain the help-seeking process. Even excessively expressing how much you would appreciate someone's help can backfire, as it may come across as self-centred and shift the focus solely onto your needs.

When asking for help, it's essential to reinforce and encourage helpful behaviour. Emphasise the shared purpose or goal you and the potential helper are working towards. By creating a sense of collaboration and shared responsibility, you foster an environment where individuals are more likely to willingly step up and offer their assistance.

Moreover, highlighting the positive sense of identity associated with being a helpful person can further reinforce the likelihood of receiving support. When people see themselves as capable and compassionate individuals, they are more inclined to engage in acts of assistance. By appealing to their sense of empathy and highlighting the positive impact their help can have, you create an environment that encourages and validates their willingness to contribute.

Lastly, providing opportunities for potential helpers to witness the effectiveness of their assistance in action can be a powerful motivator. When people can observe the tangible outcomes and positive consequences of their help, it reinforces their belief in their ability to make a difference. This, in turn, increases their likelihood of offering assistance and feeling a sense of fulfilment in doing so.

By avoiding behaviours that make the situation uncomfortable or awkward and instead focusing on reinforcing helpful behaviour, fostering a shared purpose, affirming positive identity, and enabling individuals to witness the impact of their assistance, you create a more conducive environment for successful help-seeking.

## Part III: Creating a Culture of Helpfulness

### The In-Group Reinforcement

Recognising the dynamics of group membership and understanding when and why we perceive others as part of our group is crucial because it strongly influences who is likely to offer help and support.

Our sense of belonging to the same group as another person enhances our inclination to assist them. This preference for our in-group can sometimes results in unfairness and biases within systems claiming meritocratic. However, we can actively counteract these unjust aspects by understanding the underlying psychology of groups.

We can consciously emphasise the categories we value, such as being on the same team or working together towards a shared goal. By intentionally highlighting these shared identities and common objectives, we can prompt the brain to shift its focus and consider these factors as the basis for determining group membership. This deliberate shift in perspective allows us to include individuals who share our purpose and align with our values, regardless of superficial differences.

By emphasising shared goals and fostering a sense of teamwork, we create a foundation for inclusive group dynamics. We can override biases and unfairness that may arise from default categorisations. This proactive approach enables us to extend our sense of group membership and willingness to help beyond traditional boundaries, enhancing fairness and fostering a more equitable system.

By understanding the powerful impact of group psychology, we gain the opportunity to shape our perceptions and biases consciously. We can actively prioritise shared identities, collective objectives, and collaboration, shifting away from arbitrary distinctions that may exclude individuals who could contribute meaningfully. Emphasising inclusive group dynamics promotes fairness, increases the likelihood of receiving help from a broader range of individuals, and fosters a more supportive and inclusive environment.

### The Positive Identity Reinforcement

The need to perceive oneself as a good person is a potent force influencing our behaviour and decision-making. A positive sense of identity serves as a significant reinforcement for our actions and choices.

When faced with evidence challenging our self-perception as good individuals, most tend to discount or rationalise it. On the other hand, when we can affirm and reinforce our identity as good people, we eagerly embrace it. The desire to align our actions with our self-perceived positive identity motivates us to engage in behaviours that uphold that image.

Research indicates that children as young as three respond strongly to positive identity reinforcement. For instance, when children were encouraged to "be a helper" rather than simply "helping" in tasks like assisting another child in cleaning up blocks, they exhibited greater motivation and more effort. This illustrates the power of framing the request to emphasise the person's identity rather than solely focusing on the task.

When providing positive identity reinforcement, whether in your initial request for help or in expressing gratitude afterwards, it is essential to highlight and affirm the kind of person the helper is. By emphasising that their act of providing support aligns with their core values and expresses who they are as an individual, you reinforce their positive identity. This affirmation strengthens their motivation to assist and reinforces their self-perception as helpful and kind-hearted people.

By consciously and intentionally framing the request or expression of thanks to emphasise the helper's identity, you tap into a powerful motivator that encourages their continued engagement and support. It creates a meaningful connection between their actions and self-concept, reinforcing their positive identity and fostering a sense of fulfilment and purpose in their helping behaviour.

### The Effectiveness Reinforcement

Effectiveness is a crucial aspect of reinforcement that help seekers must consider. , people want to know that their actions have made a meaningful difference.

Conversely, when individuals perceive their efforts as futile or believe their work has no impact, their motivation dwindles. Over time, a lack of feeling effective can lead to clinical helplessness and depression. Therefore, the desire to experience a sense of effectiveness in helping others is essential for sustaining motivation and reaping the psychological rewards that come with helping.

When asking for someone's help, it is vital to emphasise the potential impact of their assistance. Communicate how their involvement and support can contribute to achieving a tangible outcome or making a positive change. By highlighting the significance of their participation, you provide a clear purpose and reinforce the potential effectiveness of their efforts.

Furthermore, expressing gratitude and acknowledging their contribution is essential. When you thank them for their helpâ€”and of course, you should tell your appreciationâ€”it is crucial to provide feedback on the results of their efforts. Share the outcomes or progress that have been achieved directly from their assistance. This feedback completes the feedback loop, allowing helpers to witness the concrete results of their actions and reinforcing their sense of effectiveness.

By emphasising the impact and outcomes when seeking assistance and providing feedback on the results of their efforts, you strengthen the effectiveness of reinforcement. This reinforcement is essential for sustaining helpers' motivation to continue providing support and enabling them to experience the psychological rewards of making a difference.

So, as you ask for someone's help, clearly communicate the potential impact, and when expressing your gratitude, be sure to share the specific results achieved. By doing so, you foster a sense of effectiveness and cultivate a culture of appreciation and fulfilment for both the helper and the help seeker.
