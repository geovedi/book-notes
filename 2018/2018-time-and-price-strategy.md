# Time and Price Strategy: A Bite-Sized Guide
**Original Title**: Time and Price Strategy
**Author**: Stanley Davies | **Year**: 2018 | **Category**: Business & Finance

## Summary
This book reveals how time serves as the hidden structure behind forex market movements, transforming trading from gambling into a systematic process. Davies argues that while price patterns can be interpreted in countless ways, time remains constant and predictable, providing traders with a reliable framework for making high-probability trading decisions.

**Who should read this**: Newbie to intermediate forex traders who feel lost in market randomness, traders struggling with consistency, or anyone wanting to add structural timing to their trading strategy. You'll gain a systematic approach that replaces guesswork with time-based probabilities.

## Core Insights

### The Weekly Structure: Open-High-Low-Close Pattern
The forex market follows a predictable weekly pattern that mirrors traditional OHLC (Open-High-Low-Close) candlestick structure, but spread across five days:

- **Monday**: Sets the opening price for the week. Often characterized by sideways consolidation as the market gathers information. Smart traders use Monday to observe, not trade.
- **Tuesday**: The "capitulation day" where markets make bold moves in the opposite direction of the week's eventual trend, designed to trap unsuspecting traders and build liquidity.
- **Wednesday**: Expansion day where the true weekly direction reveals itself with strong momentum moves.
- **Thursday**: Typically forms the weekly high or low, making it ideal for taking profits on positions established earlier in the week.
- **Friday**: Sets the closing price for the week, usually featuring sideways action as positions are squared up.

> "If anyone tells you price moves randomly they are wrong and with this information you can prove them wrong."

**Quick Take**: Each trading day has a specific job to do. Don't force trades on days when the market's role is observation or consolidation.

### Daily Trading Sessions: The Sniper's Time Windows
The 24-hour forex market becomes manageable when broken into specific time windows that offer high-probability opportunities:

**Asian Session (0 GMT - 5 GMT)**: The accumulation phase where major orders are stacked. Creates a daily compass range with a mean threshold that divides buyer and seller territory for the day.

**London Session (8 GMT - 10 GMT)**: The most volatile session, typically setting the daily high or low. The first two hours offer prime trading opportunities when price reacts to key levels.

**New York Session (13 GMT - 15 GMT)**: Provides continuation or reversal of London's price action. The 1320 GMT CME opening price acts as a crucial filter between buyers and sellers.

**London Close (15 GMT - 16 GMT)**: Prime time for profit-taking as liquidity decreases with London session ending.

**New York Close (19 GMT)**: Last resort for closing intraday positions.

> "The first two and last two hours of each trading session offer perfect periods of time that you can focus on for your entries and exits."

**Quick Take**: Instead of trading randomly throughout 24 hours, focus your energy on 2-hour windows where institutional activity creates predictable patterns.

### Time Confluence: The Edge You've Been Missing
The real power comes when time converges with price levels at key reaction points. Rather than trading price patterns alone, wait for:

1. Key price levels (support/resistance, daily highs/lows, order blocks)
2. Time windows (specific session opens/closes)
3. Market structure breaks
4. Mean threshold breaches of Asian ranges

This quadruple confluence creates the highest probability setups with defined risk-reward ratios.

**Quick Take**: Price tells you what to trade, but time tells you when to trade it. Missing either component reduces your edge significantly.

## Best Quotes

- "Trading has a structure just like your 8 to 5 job. That is why the successful traders who have learned and embraced this fact have been able to make the best out of this business."

- "Sitting on your hands does not mean that you do not know what you are doing either, it means you are patient enough to wait for your trading setups to come along aligned with your expectations of when you expect them to happen."

- "Your growth will be determined by your hunger to understand more than your urge to make money right away."

- "I can understand the frustrations that a newbie trader or a developing trader goes through because I was there too. It is disheartening to do everything within your means and still get the same unsatisfactory results."

## Action Items

- **Create a Time Framework**: Map out the five key trading sessions in your timezone and mark the high-probability windows (session opens/closes)

- **Track Weekly Patterns**: For one month, document how price behaves each day of the week without taking trades. Notice the OHLC weekly structure

- **Build Asian Ranges**: Daily, mark the 0 GMT - 5 GMT Asian range and identify the mean threshold. Watch how price respects this level throughout the day

- **Session Alignment**: Only take trades when your price analysis aligns with the appropriate time window (London Open for trend entries, London Close for exits)

- **Time-First Mentality**: Start your analysis each day by asking "What time is it?" before looking at any price patterns

## Questions to Consider

- How much of your trading losses come from trading during low-probability time windows?

- Are you treating trading like a structured business or random gambling?

- What would happen to your results if you only traded during the 2-hour windows described?

- How can you incorporate time as your primary filter rather than your afterthought?

- Are you patiently waiting for time-price confluence or forcing trades when conditions aren't optimal?

## Conclusion
This book is worth your time if you're tired of feeling like forex trading is random and unpredictable. Davies provides a concrete framework that transforms trading from guessing to systematic execution. The biggest reason to read this is that time is the one constant in markets that never changes while price patterns evolve.

The weekly OHLC structure and session-based approach alone can eliminate 80% of low-probability trades you might currently take. By focusing on when to trade rather than what to trade, you develop patience and discipline that separate professionals from amateurs. While the concepts seem simple, mastery requires weeks of observation before implementation.

The book's strength lies in its practical, rule-based approach that removes emotional decision-making. If you're willing to trade less but more strategically, this time-based framework could dramatically improve your consistency and confidence.
