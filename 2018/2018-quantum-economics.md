# Quantum Economics
**Original Title**: Quantum Economics: The New Science of Money
**Authors**: David Orrell | **Year**: 2018 | **Category**: Business & Finance

## Summary
Quantum Economics presents a revolutionary framework that challenges the foundations of mainstream neoclassical economics by applying principles from quantum physics to monetary systems. The book argues that money itself is a quantum phenomenon with dualistic properties—combining the virtual nature of numbers with the physical reality of objects—much like how light exhibits both wave and particle characteristics. This quantum nature of money creates inherent uncertainty, entanglement between financial actors, and measurement effects that shape economic behavior in ways that classical economic models cannot explain.

The book is essential reading for economists, financial professionals, policymakers, and anyone interested in understanding why traditional economic models consistently fail to predict financial crises, explain inequality, or account for the seemingly irrational behavior of markets. Readers will gain a new perspective on money, value, and economic transactions that better reflects the complex, interconnected reality of our modern financial system.

## Core Insights

### Money as a Quantum Phenomenon
At the heart of quantum economics is the radical proposition that money has inherent quantum properties. Money objects—whether physical coins, digital currencies, or credit entries—combine the virtual nature of numbers (wave-like) with the physical reality of owned things (particle-like). This duality explains why money can serve as both a medium of exchange and a unit of account simultaneously. When we conduct transactions, we're performing quantum-like measurements that collapse the fuzzy concept of value into specific numerical prices, just as measuring a quantum particle forces it into a definite state.

> "Money is a way of combining the properties of a number with the properties of an owned thing. The fact that numbers and things are as different as waves and particles in quantum mechanics is what gives money its unique properties."
> _Original: "Money is a way of combining the properties of a number with the properties of an owned thing..."_
**Quick Take**: Economic transactions aren't simple exchanges—they're measurement processes that create reality rather than just observing it.

### The Quantum Theory of Value
Traditional economics struggles with the question of what money actually measures. Classical economists argued money measures labor, while neoclassical economists claim it measures utility. Quantum economics proposes a simpler but more profound answer: when we use money to measure value, we're measuring money itself. Money serves as a quantum measurement device that assigns numerical values to goods and services through transactions. The price of an item isn't inherent in the item itself but emerges from the quantum measurement process of exchange, making value fundamentally relational and contextual rather than absolute.

> "Instead of grams or amperes, the units are units of currency. When you buy something, you are measuring—money."
> _Original: "Instead of grams or amperes, the units are units of currency. When you buy something, you are measuring – money."_
**Quick Take**: Value isn't discovered through transactions—it's created by them, making the market a dynamic quantum measurement system rather than a passive price-discovery mechanism.

### Financial Entanglement
One of the most powerful quantum concepts applied to economics is entanglement. In quantum physics, measuring one particle instantly affects its entangled partner regardless of distance. Similarly, money creates quantum entanglement between people, institutions, and financial systems. When you take out a loan, you become quantumly entangled with the lender—your financial fates become interconnected. This explains why financial crises spread rapidly through the global system and why individual financial decisions can have system-wide consequences. The global debt of over $200 trillion represents a massive entanglement network that makes the financial system inherently unstable and unpredictable.

> "One implication is that the information encoded in money is a kind of quantum entanglement device, because its creation always has two sides, debt and credit. And its use also entangles people with each other and with the system as a whole, as anyone with a loan will know."
> _Original: "One implication is that the information encoded in money is a kind of quantum entanglement device..."_
**Quick Take**: Financial interconnections aren't just complicated—they're quantumly entangled, creating systemic risks that traditional models cannot predict or prevent.

### The Uncertainty Principle in Economics
Just as Heisenberg's uncertainty principle states that we cannot simultaneously know a particle's exact position and momentum, quantum economics establishes that economic value has inherent uncertainty. The price of an asset is fundamentally indeterminate until measured through a transaction, and the act of measurement affects the system. This explains why markets are inherently volatile, why price predictions fail, and why financial models that assume certainty and stability consistently break down. The uncertainty principle also reveals why attempts to eliminate risk through financial instruments often create new, more dangerous forms of systemic risk.

> "Price is an uncertain property which is in a sense created through transactions—just as a particle's position or momentum is inherently indeterminate until measured."
> _Original: "Price is an uncertain property which is in a sense created through transactions – just as a particle's position or momentum is inherently indeterminate until measured."_
**Quick Take**: Market uncertainty isn't a flaw to be eliminated—it's a fundamental feature of economic reality that should be embraced rather than denied.

### Quantum Decision-Making
Traditional economic models assume rational, independent decision-makers, but quantum economics shows that human behavior is fundamentally quantum-like. We don't make decisions in isolation but are influenced by context, social connections, and cognitive interference effects. Quantum cognition reveals that people often violate classical logic in ways that align perfectly with quantum probability theory. This explains market anomalies, behavioral quirks, and the persistent failure of rational agent models. Our financial decisions are quantum processes that depend on context, relationship, and the measurement-like act of choice itself.

> "Instead of behaving like independent Newtonian particles, as assumed in mainstream neoclassical economics, we are actually closely entangled and engaged in a sort of collective quantum dance."
> _Original: "Instead of behaving like independent Newtonian particles, as assumed in mainstream neoclassical economics, we are actually closely entangled and engaged in a sort of collective quantum dance."_
**Quick Take**: Economic decisions aren't made by isolated rational agents but by quantumly entangled humans whose choices are shaped by context and connection.

## Best Quotes
- "The word 'quantum' of course has a lot of history. It was applied by physicists over a century ago to describe another kind of transaction—the exchange of energy between subatomic particles. And it eventually overturned our most basic assumptions about the universe by showing that, instead of a deterministic machine, it was something more complex, entangled, and alive."

- "Money objects are therefore a way of mediating between the real and the virtual. While they are naturally suited for use as a medium of exchange or a store of value, and their units are useful for accounting purposes, these properties are a consequence of their design, rather than a defining feature."

- "The act of money creation also finds a direct analogue in the creation of subatomic particles out of the void, as we will discover. One implication is that the information encoded in money is a kind of quantum entanglement device, because its creation always has two sides, debt and credit."

- "We just need to look more closely at money. When we compare quantum physics with our everyday notion of how objects exist and move around it makes no sense; but when we compare it with monetary transactions it all seems rather reasonable. Money therefore has much to tell us about the quantum world."

## Conclusion
Quantum Economics represents a paradigm shift comparable to the transition from classical to quantum physics in the early 20th century. By revealing the quantum nature of money and economic transactions, Orrell provides a framework that explains many of the persistent puzzles and failures of mainstream economics—from financial crises to market inefficiencies to inequality. The book demonstrates that the economy is not a mechanical clockwork but a living quantum system, with all the uncertainty, entanglement, and measurement effects that implies.

This is essential reading for anyone who wants to understand why traditional economics consistently fails and what a more realistic approach might look like. While some of the quantum concepts may seem challenging at first, Orrell's clear writing and numerous examples make these ideas accessible and compelling. The biggest reason to read this book is that it doesn't just critique existing economics—it offers a concrete alternative framework that better matches the reality of our complex, interconnected financial world. In an era of increasing economic volatility and systemic risk, quantum economics provides not just understanding but practical tools for navigating the quantum nature of our financial future.
