# A Richness of Martens
**Authors**: Polly Pullar, with foreword by John Lister-Kaye | **Year**: 2018 | **Category**: Science & Nature

## Summary

A Richness of Martens is an intimate celebration of Scotland's pine martens and the wild landscapes they inhabit, particularly the Ardnamurchan peninsula. Written by field naturalist Polly Pullar, the book weaves together her personal encounters with these elusive creatures and the extraordinary observations of Les and Chris Humphreys, who dedicated their garden to studying martens for over fourteen years. The narrative extends beyond martens to encompass the rich tapestry of Highland wildlife and the ancient Atlantic oak woodlands that serve as vital habitat.

This book will captivate nature enthusiasts, wildlife photographers, and anyone fascinated by Scotland's natural heritage. Readers will gain profound insights into pine marten behavior, intelligence, and individual personalities, as well as a deeper appreciation for the interconnectedness of Highland ecosystems and the importance of preserving these wild places.

## Core Insights

### The Intelligence and Personality of Pine Martens
Pine martens possess remarkable intelligence and individual personalities that challenge our understanding of wildlife behavior. Through detailed observations of individual martens like Graham and Freda, we discover that these creatures form bonds with humans, show remarkable problem-solving abilities, and exhibit distinct temperaments. Graham, the alpha male, would softly extend his paw and place it on his human observers' hands when taking an egg, demonstrating a gentleness that defies his wild nature.

> "When taking an egg from either of them, he would softly extend a paw and place it on their hand. They describe this as having the touch of velvet. He would then carefully remove the egg, using his teeth."

**Quick Take**: Pine martens are not just instinct-driven animals but intelligent beings capable of forming relationships and exhibiting remarkable problem-solving skills.

### Scotland's Ancient Atlantic Oak Woodlands
The book reveals that Scotland's western seaboard hosts ancient oak woodlands that are as ecologically significant as the Amazon rainforest. These wind-sculpted trees, often growing horizontally and contorted by Atlantic gales, support over 500 different species. Many of these woods are heading toward the end of their natural life, with grazing pressures from sheep and deer preventing natural regeneration, making their conservation crucial for wildlife including pine martens and wildcats.

> "It is important to value and recognise that an Atlantic oak wood, like its Amazon counterpart, provides an equally astonishing habitat."

**Quick Take**: Scotland possesses its own unique rainforest ecosystem that is critically important yet often overlooked, requiring urgent conservation attention.

### The Power of Patient Wildlife Observation
Through the Humphreys' fourteen-year dedication to studying martens in their garden, we learn that patient, long-term observation reveals insights that quick studies cannot capture. Their willingness to transform their space for wildlife research led to extraordinary discoveries about marten family dynamics, hunting techniques, and interspecies relationships that challenge conventional wildlife management approaches.

> "Over the past fourteen years, my close friendship with them has added another aspect to my wildlife sojourns in Ardnamurchan – a place that has grounded my passion for the natural world since my early childhood."

**Quick Take**: Deep, patient observation of wildlife in natural settings yields discoveries that formal scientific studies often miss.

### The Interconnectedness of Highland Ecosystems
The book masterfully illustrates how pine martens are interconnected with the broader Highland ecosystem, from the rowan berries they feast on to the complex relationships with other species like golden eagles, otters, and red deer. The marten's collective noun being "richness" perfectly captures how these creatures represent the abundance and diversity of their habitat.

> "The pine marten's collective noun is a 'richness', and though the marten is the leading character in my story, the term 'richness' also usefully highlights the diversity of my meanderings."

**Quick Take**: Understanding any single species requires appreciating its role within the complex web of relationships that define its ecosystem.

### The Transformative Power of Wild Spaces
Pullar demonstrates how wild spaces, particularly the Ardnamurchan peninsula, have the power to transform human understanding and connection to nature. Her childhood experiences in this landscape shaped her entire life's path, showing how early exposure to wild places can create lifelong conservation advocates and naturalists.

> "Ardnamurchan is at the root of my very being, and its diverse wildlife and wild places quickly forged my burgeoning fascination for the natural world."

**Quick Take**: Wild spaces are not just important for wildlife conservation but for human development and environmental consciousness.

## Best Quotes

- "A curvy form dances out into the open, wearing a coat of mocha colour and a pristine yellow-cream bib. It is playing with something, and then rubbing its elastic body over it. It picks it up in its mouth and throws it into the air, then leaps to catch it before pirouetting onto a rock. It turns and stands silhouetted against the low light – a pine marten with a vole. And then as quickly as it appeared it melts silently into the shadows."

- "This oak wood, like many of the others around Ardnamurchan, is simply one of the most beautiful places in Scotland, but when a gale rages and the rain comes down the Sound in horizontal sheets, it becomes a werewolf, savage in its wrath and hostility, and somehow, yes, equally as beautiful as in its calmer moments."

- "The loch is never still. It is a mirror with a constantly changing reflection, flat calm, steely hammer-marked grey, deep navy blue, electric turquoise, or a flat neutral-coloured sheet, blurred and blotted with mist and moisture, and hidden under a blanket of ceaseless rain."

- "A pine marten's life is simple. They are driven by need and fear – those two. Need for food and a mate; fear of man the dread predator, the exterminator."

- "The loch is a mirror for the natural world, accurately reflecting its endlessly changing humour."

## Action Items

- **Support conservation organizations** working to protect Scotland's Atlantic oak woodlands and pine marten habitats
- **Practice patient wildlife observation** in your local area to develop deeper understanding of animal behavior
- **Create wildlife-friendly spaces** in gardens or community areas that support native biodiversity
- **Learn about local ecosystems** and the interconnected relationships between species in your region
- **Advocate for protection of ancient woodlands** and other vital habitats in your area

## Questions to Consider

- How might our understanding of wildlife change if we approached observation with the patience and dedication shown by the Humphreys?
- What role do individual personalities play in conservation efforts, and how can we better recognize and respect the individuality of wild animals?
- How can urban and suburban residents create meaningful connections with wildlife when living far from wild places like Ardnamurchan?
- What responsibilities do we have to protect ancient habitats that have existed for centuries but may be reaching the end of their natural life cycles?
- How might climate change be affecting the delicate balance of Highland ecosystems and the species that depend on them?

## Conclusion

A Richness of Martens is far more than a book about pine martens—it's a profound meditation on the nature of wildness, the importance of patient observation, and the deep connections between place, wildlife, and human understanding. Pullar's writing combines scientific observation with poetic appreciation, creating a work that both educates and inspires. The book's greatest strength lies in its ability to make readers care deeply about these specific creatures while also illuminating broader ecological truths.

The biggest reason to read this book is to experience how careful, long-term observation can reveal the hidden lives of creatures most of us never see, and to understand how such observation can transform our relationship with the natural world. In an era of rapid environmental change, books like this remind us of what's at stake and why the preservation of wild places matters not just for wildlife, but for human wellbeing and understanding.
