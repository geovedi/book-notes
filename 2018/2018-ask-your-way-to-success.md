# Ask Your Way to Success
**Authors**: Chase Andrews | **Year**: 2018

## Summary
"Ask Your Way to Success" is a comprehensive guide that reveals how the simple act of asking—when combined with mindfulness and massive action—can unlock unprecedented opportunities and success. The book introduces a unique framework where success operates on two parallel tracks: the tangible (phenomena) and intangible (noumena). Through the art of asking, readers learn to align their mind, body, and soul to transmit powerful vibrations to the universe, which then responds with corresponding opportunities.

This guide is perfect for entrepreneurs, professionals, and anyone feeling stuck in their personal or professional journey who wants to understand how to deliberately attract the right opportunities while avoiding distractions that masquerade as opportunities.

## Core Insights

### The Art of Vibration-Based Asking
Success begins with understanding that the universe responds not to your words, but to your vibrations. When you ask for something with genuine inspiration and alignment across mind, body, and soul, you create a powerful frequency that attracts corresponding opportunities. This isn't about repetitive requests or wishful thinking—it's about achieving a state where your entire being vibrates in harmony with your desires.

> "Whatever you ask for, you will get. So, indeed, you need to be careful what you ask for because when it comes, it could be distraction."

**Quick Take**: Focus on aligning your entire being—mind, body, and soul—behind one clear intention rather than making scattered requests.

### The Three Types of Opportunities
The universe presents opportunities in three distinct forms. The first and most valuable is the opportunity directly relevant to your current task and purpose. The second appears when you're only partially aware and may confuse your path. The third is actually a full-blown distraction disguised as an opportunity that threatens to derail your progress completely. Learning to distinguish between these types is crucial for sustained success.

> "An opportunity that does not advance your current purpose is not an opportunity no matter how good it looks."

**Quick Take**: Stay mindful and focused on your current objective to ensure you attract the right opportunities rather than distracting alternatives.

### Massive Action Framework
Success requires more than just attracting opportunities—you must be prepared to take massive, sustained action when they arrive. This framework includes six essential steps: physical preparation through workouts, healthy eating, life balance, knowing your field through experience rather than theory, crystal-clear clarity of purpose, and maintaining momentum through disciplined scheduling.

> "When you are inspired and ready, the opportunities that come to you are exactly what you need to make things move and make things happen."

**Quick Take**: Prepare your body and mind for intense action before opportunities arrive, so you're ready to capitalize immediately when they do.

### The Power of Mindful Awareness
Mindful awareness is your greatest defense against distractions and your strongest tool for recognizing true opportunities. Unlike conscious awareness which relies on your senses, mindful awareness operates at a deeper level, helping you stay present and aligned with your purpose regardless of external circumstances.

> "The butterfly counts not months but moments and has time enough."

**Quick Take**: Practice staying present in each moment rather than multitasking, as quality of focus determines quality of results.

### Balance Between Dual Purposes
You have dual purposes: your body's need to survive and thrive, and your soul's drive toward greatness. Success comes from balancing these purposes rather than sacrificing one for the other. Your body is the vehicle for your soul's ambitions, so neglecting either undermines your overall success potential.

> "If you do not take care of your body, you will not be able to be of much use to the soul."

**Quick Take**: View self-care not as selfishness but as essential maintenance for the vehicle that carries you toward greatness.

## Conclusion
"Ask Your Way to Success" offers a refreshingly practical approach to achieving meaningful success by combining spiritual principles with actionable frameworks. The book's greatest strength is its emphasis on alignment—between mind, body, and soul; between asking and acting; between inspiration and execution.

This is worth your time if you're ready to move beyond passive goal-setting to actively participating in your success creation. The biggest reason to read it is understanding that success isn't about random luck or hard work alone—it's about deliberate alignment and asking with purpose. The vibration-based approach to asking may feel unconventional, but the results speak for themselves when properly applied.

For busy readers, focus on Chapters 1, 4, and 5, which contain the core frameworks on asking, massive action, and maintaining momentum. The rest provides valuable supporting context but these three chapters alone can transform your approach to opportunity and success.
