**Author**: Patrick Forsyth | **Year**: 2018 | **Category**: Business & Finance

## Summary
"Smart Skills: Business Writing" presents business writing as "the business equivalent of an open goal" - a significant opportunity that most professionals fail to capitalize on. Forsyth argues that good writing isn't just about correctness; it's about achieving specific business objectives and building your professional reputation. The book provides a systematic approach to transforming your writing from a chore into a powerful tool for influence and effectiveness.

This practical guide is essential for busy professionals who want to write more effectively in less time. Readers will learn how to plan systematically, choose words precisely, persuade ethically, and adapt their style to different business contexts - from quick emails to comprehensive proposals.

## Core Insights

### Business Writing Must Earn a Reading
Readers are overwhelmed and selective. Your documents compete for attention against countless others. To succeed, writing must be brief, succinct, relevant, clear, precise, and structured for low cognitive effort. One poorly chosen word or ambiguous phrase can undermine your entire message, while a well-crafted document can enhance your reputation and achieve your objectives.

> "Business writing must earn a reading."
**Quick Take**: Always consider the reader's perspective - make your document appear easy and inviting to read.

### Systematic Preparation Saves Time
Don't start with a blank page and begin writing immediately. Use the six-stage approach: Research, List content randomly, Sort and organize, Arrange sequentially, Review with fresh eyes, then Write. This systematic process, taking 15-30% of your total time, actually speeds up the writing process and produces dramatically better results.

> "Thinking must precede writing."
**Quick Take**: Invest in planning upfront - it saves time and prevents major rewrites later.

### Choose Words with Surgical Precision
Bland, vague language dilutes your impact. Replace "quite good" with "outstanding" and "rather expensive" with "premium-priced." Understand precise distinctions between commonly confused words (continuous vs. continual, disinterested vs. uninterested). Use descriptive language that paints vivid pictures rather than generic phrases that create impressions without substance.

> "A man who could give lessons in leering." (example of powerful description)
**Quick Take**: Keep a dictionary and thesaurus at your desk - precise word choice separates amateur from professional writing.

### Persuasion is Helping People Decide
Effective persuasion isn't about "doing something to people" but helping them make informed decisions. Use the AIDA framework: Command Attention, build Interest, create Desire, and prompt Action. Focus on benefits over features - what your proposal means to the reader rather than just what it contains. Convert features to benefits using the "which means that" test.

> "Persuasion should be seen as working with people."
**Quick Take**: Always ask "What does this mean to the reader?" before writing any persuasive content.

### Match Method to Message
Different business documents require different approaches. Standard letters need careful crafting and regular review to avoid becoming stale. Emails demand immediate clarity and caution - they're non-retrievable once sent. Reports and proposals need structured, benefits-led approaches that acknowledge how busy readers actually consume information.

> "Struggling author, patient, reliable (non-smoker), seeks commission..." (creative follow-up that worked)
**Quick Take**: Ask "Should I really be writing this?" and match your communication method to your message and audience.

## Action Items

- **Before writing anything**: Ask "Why am I writing this?" and "What am I trying to achieve?"
- **Use systematic preparation**: Follow the six-stage process regardless of document length
- **Focus on reader benefits**: Always explain what your message means to the recipient
- **Edit ruthlessly for conciseness**: Cut unnecessary words and clarify vague expressions
- **Test important documents**: Get colleagues to review before finalizing critical communications
- **Keep reference tools handy**: Dictionary and thesaurus should be desk essentials
- **Use the 5-minute email rule**: Wait before sending emotionally charged messages
- **Regular review**: Update standard letters and templates to prevent staleness

## Questions to Consider

- How much time do you currently spend planning versus actually writing business documents?
- When was the last time you reviewed and updated your standard templates and form letters?
- Are your emails truly serving their purpose, or could some conversations be better handled face-to-face?
- Do you focus more on features or benefits when trying to persuade others?
- What impression do your written documents create about your professional competence?

## Conclusion

"Smart Skills: Business Writing" is worth your time because it transforms writing from a dreaded chore into a strategic advantage. Forsyth's practical, systematic approach makes better writing achievable for anyone willing to apply these principles. The biggest reason to read this book is that good business writing is genuinely an open goal - most professionals write poorly, so even modest improvements can significantly enhance your effectiveness and reputation.

This isn't just about grammar and correctness; it's about achieving real business results through clearer communication. In a world where everyone's overwhelmed by information, the ability to write documents that actually get read, understood, and acted upon is a genuine competitive advantage.
