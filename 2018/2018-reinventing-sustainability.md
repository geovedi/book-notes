# Reinventing Sustainability
**Authors**: Erika Guttmann-Bond | **Year**: 2018 | **Category**: Science & Nature

## Summary
"Reinventing Sustainability" presents a revolutionary argument that archaeology—through the study of ancient and traditional farming practices—holds the key to solving our modern environmental crisis. Guttmann-Bond, an environmental archaeologist, challenges the conventional wisdom that sustainability requires high-tech solutions by demonstrating how traditional, low-tech agricultural systems often outperform modern industrial farming in productivity, resilience, and environmental protection.

The book reveals how ancient farmers developed sophisticated systems for water management, soil conservation, and food production through thousands of years of trial and error. These traditional methods, which the author calls "intermediate technology," are experiencing a global renaissance as farmers, researchers, and governments discover their remarkable effectiveness. From Bangladesh's "New Agriculture" movement to desert farming in the Negev, from Amazonian Dark Earth techniques to Three Sisters intercropping, the book presents compelling evidence that combining ancient wisdom with modern science can create truly sustainable food systems.

This book is essential reading for environmentalists, farmers, policymakers, and anyone concerned about food security and climate change. Readers will discover practical, proven solutions that are already working around the world to increase crop yields, conserve water and soil, reduce chemical inputs, and revitalize rural economies.

## Core Insights

### Ancient Agriculture Outperforms Modern Systems in Many Contexts
Traditional agricultural systems developed over millennia of trial and error represent sophisticated solutions to environmental challenges. Contrary to assumptions that "modern" equals "better," many ancient farming methods actually produce higher yields than industrial agriculture while being more resilient to climate shocks. For example, the "New Agriculture" movement in Bangladesh combines traditional intercropping (growing seven different crops together) with composting techniques to achieve yields 75-195% higher than conventional farming while eliminating chemical inputs.

> "Throughout this book, I give examples of how traditional knowledge is already working to save the planet. I want to see these developments snowball."

**Quick Take**: Traditional farming isn't backward—it's a sophisticated technology that we're only beginning to understand and appreciate.

### Water Harvesting Systems Can Make Deserts Bloom
Ancient desert farmers developed remarkable water harvesting systems that turned arid landscapes into productive farmland. In the Negev desert, ancient runoff farms collected rainwater during rare storms and stored it in elaborate systems of terraces, cisterns, and channels. When modern scientists reconstructed these systems, they produced abundant crops even during severe droughts that wiped out conventional farms throughout Israel.

**Quick Take**: Water scarcity isn't just about having less water—it's about being smarter about capturing and using every drop that falls.

### Soil Health is the Foundation of Sustainable Agriculture
The book emphasizes that soil is not merely dirt but a living ecosystem teeming with microbes, fungi, and organic matter. Industrial agriculture's reliance on chemical fertilizers and intensive tillage destroys this biological foundation, leading to soil degradation, erosion, and reduced fertility. Traditional practices like conservation tillage, composting, and intercropping build soil organic matter, creating fertile, resilient soils that require fewer inputs.

**Quick Take**: Healthy soil grows healthy plants; destroyed soil requires expensive chemical life support.

### Intermediate Technology is Often More Appropriate Than High-Tech Solutions
The book challenges the assumption that bigger, more expensive technology is always better. Drawing on E.F. Schumacher's concept of "appropriate technology," Guttmann-Bond shows how simple, low-cost solutions that use local materials and labor are often more effective than expensive, imported equipment that breaks down and can't be repaired locally.

> "Many ancient technologies are defined by engineers as 'intermediate': they are simple, low in cost and they depend on local materials. Significantly, they do not require fossil fuels."

**Quick Take**: The best technology isn't always the most advanced—it's the most appropriate to local conditions and resources.

### Vernacular Architecture Offers Sustainable Building Solutions
Traditional building techniques using local materials are experiencing a revival as we recognize their sustainability advantages. Mud brick, earth construction, and other vernacular approaches provide natural insulation, use minimal energy, and create comfortable living spaces without the environmental costs of concrete and steel. These traditional methods can be combined with modern amenities like solar panels to create genuinely sustainable buildings.

**Quick Take**: The greenest building material is often the one already beneath your feet.

## Best Quotes

- "None of the conservation methods I discuss here are 'pie in the sky'. Throughout this book, I give examples of how traditional knowledge is already working to save the planet."
- "My students have gone out and performed their own experiments, one recreating the ultra-productive and carbon-storing Amazonian Dark Earth soil here in west Wales, and another introducing the perfect ecological circle known as the 'Three Sisters' intercropping system to an organic farm in the Netherlands."
- "In the desert, people have no choice but to be wise."
- "What I am suggesting is that we can use some aspects of early technology, and we can combine old, tested techniques with new systems and inventions, to create a healthier, more sustainable and environmentally richer planet."
- "This myopic conclusion suggested to me that the problem was not financial or technological: it was simply due to a failure of the imagination."

## Action Items

- **Support local organic farmers** who use sustainable growing methods rather than industrial agriculture
- **Start composting** to return organic matter to the soil instead of sending it to landfills
- **Learn about traditional food growing** in your region and adapt these techniques to your garden or community space
- **Advocate for policies** that support small-scale, sustainable agriculture over industrial monocropping
- **Consider vernacular building approaches** for construction projects, prioritizing local and natural materials
- **Support organizations** like Practical Action that promote appropriate technology in developing countries
- **Reduce tillage** in your own gardening or farming practices to preserve soil structure and organic matter

## Questions to Consider

- Why do we assume that newer technology is always better, when evidence often shows traditional methods outperform modern ones?
- How can we overcome what the author calls "a failure of the imagination" to recognize ancient solutions to modern problems?
- What traditional knowledge from your own region or culture might hold solutions to current environmental challenges?
- How can we better integrate ancient wisdom with modern scientific understanding rather than rejecting the past?
- What role should archaeology and anthropology play in addressing climate change and food security?

## Conclusion

"Reinventing Sustainability" is a groundbreaking book that challenges our assumptions about progress and technology. Guttmann-Bond makes a compelling case that many solutions to our most pressing environmental problems already exist—we just need to recognize and implement them. The book is meticulously researched, drawing on archaeology, environmental science, and case studies from around the world.

What makes this book particularly valuable is its optimism and practicality. Rather than presenting abstract theories or requiring massive technological breakthroughs, Guttmann-Bond shows how sustainable solutions are already working in communities worldwide. The combination of traditional knowledge and modern science offers a realistic path forward that doesn't require sacrificing productivity or prosperity.

This is essential reading for anyone concerned about climate change, food security, or environmental sustainability. It will change how you think about agriculture, technology, and the wisdom of our ancestors. The biggest reason to read it? It offers genuine hope that we can create a sustainable future by rediscovering the genius of the past.
