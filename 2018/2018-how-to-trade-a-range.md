# How to Trade a Range
**Authors**: Heikin Ashi Trader | **Year**: 2018

## Summary
This practical trading guide reveals that contrary to popular belief, financial markets spend approximately 70% of their time trading sideways rather than in trends. Most traders focus exclusively on trend-following strategies, missing the substantial opportunities presented by range-bound markets. The author presents range trading as a systematic approach to profit from these "trendless" periods that actually dominate market behavior.

The book teaches traders how to identify trading ranges, draw proper support and resistance lines, and execute trades with clear entry, exit, and risk management rules. It's particularly valuable for traders who struggle with choppy markets or want to diversify beyond trend-following strategies. The approach works across all timeframes, from scalping to swing trading, and applies to various markets including forex, futures, and stock indices.

## Core Insights

### The Reality of Market Behavior
Markets are predominantly sideways-moving, not trend-following. The author demonstrates through EUR/USD charts that even during apparent "trend periods," the majority of trading days occur within range-bound zones. This fundamental insight reshapes how traders should approach the markets - rather than avoiding sideways periods, they should embrace them as the normal market condition that offers predictable trading opportunities.

> "Trends are the exceptions, while sideways markets are the rule."

**Quick Take**: Stop fighting the market's natural tendency to range. Instead, develop strategies that profit from this predominant market condition.

### Identifying and Drawing Ranges
Proper range identification requires at least two touches of both support and resistance levels. The author emphasizes drawing lines through the most significant contact points rather than exact highs and lows. These create "support zones" and "resistance zones" rather than precise lines. The more contact points a range has, the more significant and reliable it becomes for trading.

> "The rule is that financial markets are predominantly trading in trendless zones, which are difficult to define."

**Quick Take**: Look to the left on your chart - historical price levels often provide the key support and resistance zones for current range trading opportunities.

### The Range Trading Strategy
The basic strategy involves buying at support and selling at resistance within clearly defined ranges. However, the entry criteria are strict: traders must wait for confirmation that the market respects the range boundaries. This might include doji patterns at support/resistance, failed breakouts that quickly return to the range, or candlestick patterns showing rejection of levels outside the range.

> "The basic idea of range trading is to open buy positions in the area of support and close them as soon as the market reaches the upper limit of the range."

**Quick Take**: Patience is crucial - wait for clear signals at range boundaries rather than jumping on every touch of support or resistance.

### Risk Management for Range Trading
Range trading offers clear advantages for risk management because the range width defines both profit targets and stop placement. Traders can use risk/reward ratios of 1:1 (requiring over 50% win rate) or 1:2 (requiring only 34% win rate). Stops should be placed outside the range boundaries, never within it, as markets often make unexpected moves within ranges before hitting targets.

> "A not to be underestimated advantage of range trading is the fact that the stop does not have to be set according to chart technical criteria."

**Quick Take**: Let the range width determine your risk/reward ratio - wider ranges allow for more flexible risk management than narrow ranges.

### Advanced Techniques and Market Adaptations
The book covers sophisticated strategies including "opportunistic limits" (trading failed breakouts) and fakeout trading. Additionally, range trading principles apply to trend channels, allowing traders to trade counter-trend within channels while the overall trend remains intact. The strategy adapts across all timeframes - from 1-minute scalping to daily charts - making it versatile for different trading styles.

> "We call trend channels trend channels because the price stays within a channel. This means nothing else but that the chances are on both sides."

**Quick Take**: Failed breakouts often provide the best range trading opportunities - when the market tests a boundary and fails, the probability of a return to the opposite boundary increases significantly.

## Best Quotes
- "Traders therefore live only from the grace of probability. The likelihood is higher that the market will turn again at this point because of previous pivot points."
- "A trader is therefore a person who repeatedly takes calculated risks, which he knows carry a (small) statistical advantage."
- "Successful trading is about a trader playing according to his own rules. If he does not, he may have a bargain every now and then, but in the end, he undermines his own psyche."
- "More important to me is that the trader learns to trust his system. This will have a positive impact on the results in the medium term."
- "The advantage of range trading is quite clear: it answers all these questions from the very beginning. Because it is the range itself that answers them."

## Action Items
- Study historical charts on multiple timeframes to identify common range patterns in your preferred markets
- Practice drawing support and resistance lines through the most significant contact points rather than exact highs/lows
- Develop a checklist for range entry signals including confirmation patterns and failed breakouts
- Create a risk management plan based on range width with clear stop placement outside range boundaries
- Maintain a trading journal specifically for range trades to track effectiveness and refine your approach

## Questions to Consider
- What percentage of time do your preferred markets actually trend versus range?
- How can you adapt your current strategy to profit from range-bound conditions rather than avoiding them?
- What is your statistical edge when trading ranges, and how do you measure it?
- Are you disciplined enough to wait for proper range signals, or do you tend to chase every touch of support/resistance?
- How would incorporating range trading complement your existing trend-following strategies?

## Conclusion
This book is essential reading for traders who consistently struggle with choppy, sideways markets or find themselves waiting endlessly for trends that never materialize. Heikin Ashi Trader makes a compelling case that range trading isn't just a backup strategy - it's actually the primary way markets behave most of the time. The systematic approach, clear rules, and practical examples across multiple markets make this a valuable addition to any trader's toolkit.

What sets this book apart is its focus on statistical reality versus trading mythology. While most traders chase trends that occur 30% of the time, this book teaches you to profit from the 70% of market time spent ranging. The psychological benefit alone - knowing exactly where to enter, exit, and place stops - makes range trading worth mastering for traders at any experience level.

The biggest reason to read this book is that it solves one of trading's most frustrating problems: what to do when markets don't trend. Instead of seeing sideways movement as a problem to avoid, you'll learn to see it as an opportunity with clearly defined parameters and predictable patterns. This perspective shift alone could transform your trading results.
