# Grit
**Authors**: Angela Duckworth | **Year**: 2018

## Summary
Grit: The Power of Passion and Perseverance challenges our obsession with natural talent by revealing that success comes from a distinct combination of passion, resilience, determination, and focus. Duckworth's research shows that grit—the ability to maintain discipline and optimism while pursuing long-term goals even in the face of setbacks—is the single most important predictor of achievement across diverse fields, from West Point cadets to spelling bee champions.

The book presents a compelling formula: talent × effort = skill, and skill × effort = achievement. This means effort counts twice in the equation for success. Duckworth demonstrates through extensive research that grit can be cultivated through four key assets: developing genuine interest, engaging in deliberate practice, connecting work to purpose, and maintaining hope through a growth mindset.

This book is essential for anyone who feels they lack natural talent but wants to achieve extraordinary results, as well as parents, educators, and leaders seeking to foster resilience and perseverance in others. Readers will learn practical strategies for building grit in themselves and creating environments where persistence flourishes.

## Core Insights

### Effort Counts Twice
Talent is your natural ability, but without effort, talent remains just potential. Duckworth's groundbreaking formula reveals that effort is the multiplier that transforms talent into skill, and then skill into actual achievement. This means effort counts twice in the success equation. The most accomplished people aren't necessarily the most gifted—they're simply the ones who work hardest and longest at developing their abilities.

> "Talent × Effort = Skill AND Skill × Effort = Achievement"
**Quick Take**: Focus on effort over talent, since effort builds skills AND makes those skills productive.

### Grit Has Two Components
Grit combines passion with perseverance, but perseverance matters more. Passion gives direction through long-term goals and coherent purpose, while perseverance provides the stamina to overcome obstacles and persist through failures. High achievers have both, but the ability to keep going when others quit is what truly sets them apart.

> "They were the opposite of complacent. And yet, in a very real sense, they were satisfied with being unsatisfied."
**Quick Take**: Cultivate both passion for your direction and perseverance for the journey.

### Deliberate Practice Trumps Time
Simply putting in 10,000 hours isn't enough—the quality of practice matters most. Deliberate practice involves specific goals stretching your abilities, full concentration, immediate feedback, and continuous refinement. This structured approach to improvement creates compound growth that casual practice can never achieve.

> "Before hard work comes play, which meant that experts started as unserious beginners."
**Quick Take**: Practice with purpose and feedback rather than just logging hours.

### Purpose Transforms Work into Calling
The same job can be experienced as merely laying bricks, building a wall, or constructing a cathedral—perspective determines whether work is a job, career, or calling. Purpose connects personal interests to serving others, providing the motivation that sustains effort through inevitable setbacks. Research shows gritty people have both self-focus (interest) and other-focus (purpose).

> "The first bricklayer had a job, the second had a career, and the third had a calling."
**Quick Take**: Connect your work to how it helps others to transform effort into meaning.

### Growth Mindset Fuels Hope
Hope isn't naive optimism—it's the belief that your actions can improve tomorrow. This comes from a growth mindset: understanding that abilities can be developed through dedication and hard work. When you interpret failure as a cue to try harder rather than proof of inadequacy, you build resilience that sustains long-term effort.

> "What doesn't kill me makes stronger."
**Quick Take**: View challenges as opportunities to grow stronger rather than as signs of limitation.

## Action Items

- How do you currently respond to failure—is it as proof of limitation or as a signal to try harder?

- Who are the grittiest people in your life, and what behaviors could you emulate from them?

- If you viewed your current work as building a cathedral rather than laying bricks, how would your approach change?

- What long-term goal would you pursue if you knew you couldn't fail?

- How do you balance competing goals and priorities without losing focus on what matters most?

- What deliberate practice structures could you implement in your key areas of development?
