# Reinforcements: How to Get People to Help You
**Author**: Heidi Grant | **Year**: 2018

## Summary
"Reinforcements" tackles one of the most universal yet uncomfortable aspects of professional and personal life: asking for help. Despite living in an interconnected world where collaboration is essential, most people dread requesting assistance, often to their own detriment. Grant reveals that our reluctance to ask for help stems from evolutionary wiring that makes social requests feel physically painful, combined with faulty assumptions about how others will respond.

The book provides both the psychological foundation for understanding why we avoid seeking help and practical strategies for overcoming these barriers. It shows that people are far more willing to help than we assume—often twice as likely—and that effective help-seeking is a skill that can be learned. By understanding the three key reinforcements that motivate people to help (in-group connection, positive identity, and effectiveness), readers can transform help-seeking from a dreaded necessity into a powerful tool for success and relationship-building.

This book is essential reading for leaders, team members, and anyone who has ever hesitated to ask for the support they need to achieve their goals.

## Core Insights

### Why We Hate Asking for Help
Our reluctance to seek help isn't just in our heads—it's biological. Research shows that social rejection activates the same brain regions as physical pain, making potential rejection genuinely painful. When we ask for help, we simultaneously face five types of social threats: status (we might appear incompetent), certainty (we don't know the outcome), autonomy (we surrender control), relatedness (we risk rejection), and fairness (a "no" feels unjust).

The paradox is that while we agonize over asking for help, studies by Vanessa Bohns and colleagues consistently show that people dramatically underestimate others' willingness to help—by about 48% on average. People are roughly twice as likely to say yes as we expect, and they're more likely to put in greater effort than we anticipate.

**Quick Take**: Your anxiety about asking for help is real, but your fears about rejection are exaggerated. People are much more helpful than you think.

### The Four Steps to Getting Help
Grant outlines four essential steps that must occur for someone to help you, each with common obstacles:

1. **Noticing**: People need to realize you need help, but they're usually too absorbed in their own concerns to notice. Your need is far less obvious to others than it feels to you.

2. **Believing**: Helpers need to know you actually want their assistance. People often hesitate to help because they fear offering unwanted support might be resented or create awkwardness.

3. **Taking Responsibility**: When multiple people could help, everyone assumes someone else will step in (the "bystander effect"). Direct requests to specific individuals are most effective.

4. **Being Able**: Potential helpers have competing priorities and time constraints. Make it easy for them by providing clear information, flexibility in how they can help, and understanding of their limitations.

> "The first step to getting the help you want from others is ensuring that they see your need. In general, people aren't paying attention to you the way you assume they are because they're preoccupied with their own stuff."

**Quick Take**: Don't assume people notice your needs or will automatically offer help. Be direct, specific, and personal in your requests.

### The In-Group Reinforcement
Human beings are wired to help members of their own "tribe." We automatically categorize people into groups, and this group membership is one of the strongest predictors of helping behavior. The key insight is that group boundaries can be flexible—even sharing something as simple as being on the same project team or working toward the same goal can trigger in-group favoritism.

Research by Henri Tajfel showed that even arbitrarily created groups (like "overestimators" vs. "underestimators" in a dot-counting task) lead people to prefer helping their own group members. This preference for in-group helping emerges because groups have been essential to human survival throughout our evolutionary history.

> "Understanding group membership, and when and why we see other people as members of our group (or not), is essential because it is one of the single best predictors of who is—and is not—likely to help you."

**Quick Take**: Emphasize shared identity, goals, or group membership when asking for help. Frame requests as working together toward common objectives.

### The Positive Identity Reinforcement
People have a fundamental need to see themselves as good individuals. When helping allows someone to affirm a positive identity, they become more motivated and engaged in the helping process. Research shows that even children as young as three respond better to being called "a helper" than simply being asked to "help."

The key is understanding what positive identity matters to your helper. For some, it's being "the kind of person who supports colleagues," while for others, it might be "someone who makes innovative projects possible" or "a problem-solver." The same helping behavior can be framed to appeal to different positive identities depending on what resonates with the individual.

> "People have a strong need to see themselves as good people. A positive sense of identity is a powerful reinforcer of behavior."

**Quick Take**: Frame your request in terms of the kind of person your helper wants to be. Connect the help you need to their positive self-image.

### The Effectiveness Reinforcement
Beyond pleasure and pain, humans are fundamentally motivated by effectiveness—the need to see that their actions make a difference. People want to know that their help actually matters and produces real results. This explains why people endure hardship for meaningful causes, why parents sacrifice for their children, and why volunteers dedicate countless hours to helping others.

When asking for help, help potential helpers visualize the impact of their contribution. Show them how their specific action will lead to meaningful outcomes, and whenever possible, provide feedback about the positive results of their assistance. People who can see the difference they're making are more likely to help again in the future.

> "Effectiveness is the third major reinforcement that help seekers need to keep in mind. Simply put, people want to know that they've made a difference."

**Quick Take**: Help people see how their assistance creates tangible results. Connect their specific contribution to meaningful outcomes and provide feedback about their impact.

## Best Quotes
- "Look for the helpers. You will always find people who are helping… if you look for the helpers, you'll know that there's hope." —Fred Rogers
- "I've never found anybody who didn't want to help me when I've asked them for help… Most people never pick up the phone and call, most people never ask. And that's what separates, sometimes, the people that do things from the people that just dream about them." —Steve Jobs
- "The idea of asking for even a small amount of help makes most of us horribly uncomfortable. Scientists have found that it can cause social pain that is every bit as real as physical pain."
- "People are roughly twice as likely to want to be helpful as we think they are."
- "When you are seeking support, be aware that you will need to alleviate that confusion by giving your benefactor a clear sense of responsibility about helping you."

## Action Items
- **Make your needs explicit**: Don't assume others notice when you need help. State your needs clearly and directly without apologizing or minimizing them.
- **Ask specific individuals**: When you need help, approach people directly rather than making group requests. This creates personal responsibility for helping.
- **Emphasize shared identity**: Frame requests in terms of group membership, shared goals, or common interests to activate in-group helping preferences.
- **Connect to positive identity**: Show how helping allows the person to be the kind of person they want to be.
- **Demonstrate impact**: Help potential helpers see how their contribution will make a meaningful difference, and follow up to show the results of their assistance.
- **Be considerate of constraints**: Acknowledge that people have competing priorities and offer flexibility in how they can help.
- **Express gratitude effectively**: Focus your thanks on who the person is and what their help enabled, not just on your relief at receiving assistance.

## Questions to Consider
- What assumptions do you make about how likely people are to help you, and how might these assumptions be holding you back?
- How can you frame your current help-seeking needs to appeal to people's desire for effectiveness, positive identity, and group connection?
- What groups do you belong to, and how might you emphasize these connections when seeking support from others?
- When was the last time you hesitated to ask for help? What were you afraid would happen, and what actually happened when you finally asked?
- How could you make it easier for others to help you by providing clearer information and more specific requests?

## Conclusion
"Reinforcements" is worth your time because it addresses one of the most critical yet overlooked skills for success in modern work and life. Grant transforms the dreaded act of asking for help from a weakness into a strength by providing both the psychological understanding and practical tools for effective help-seeking.

The book's biggest insight is that our fears about asking for help are largely unfounded—people are far more willing to help than we assume, and they actually feel better about themselves when they do. By learning to leverage the three reinforcements of in-group connection, positive identity, and effectiveness, you can turn help-seeking from an agonizing necessity into an opportunity for building stronger relationships and achieving better outcomes together.

If you've ever hesitated to ask for the support you need, struggled to get cooperation from colleagues, or wanted to create a more helpful team environment, this book provides the roadmap for making it happen. The strategies are immediately applicable and the insights are transformative, making it an essential read for anyone who wants to succeed through collaboration rather than solitary effort.
