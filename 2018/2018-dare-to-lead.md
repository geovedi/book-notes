# Dare to Lead
**Authors**: Brené Brown | **Year**: 2018

## Summary
"Dare to Lead" transforms leadership from a position of power into a practice of courage. Based on extensive research with 150 C-level executives and data from 400,000 pieces of information, Brown demonstrates that brave leadership isn't about having courage—it's about teaching and practicing courage as a set of measurable skills. The book argues that in today's complex, rapidly changing environment, we need braver leaders and more courageous cultures where people can bring their whole selves to work.

This book is essential for anyone who leads teams, manages organizations, or aspires to leadership roles. You'll learn how to build trust, navigate difficult conversations, and create environments where innovation thrives through vulnerability, not despite it. Whether you're a seasoned executive or emerging leader, you'll gain actionable tools for developing the four skill sets that underpin daring leadership.

## Core Insights

### The Four Skill Sets of Daring Leadership
Brown's research reveals that courage isn't a personality trait but a collection of four teachable, observable, and measurable skill sets that form the foundation of brave leadership.

**1. Rumbling with Vulnerability**
At the heart of daring leadership is the truth that courage and fear are not mutually exclusive—we can feel brave and afraid at the exact same time. Rumbling with vulnerability means embracing difficult conversations rather than avoiding them. Brown introduces the concept of a "rumble" as a shared language and behavioral cue for having real, honest conversations even when they're tough. This requires moving beyond common myths about vulnerability: that it's weakness, that you can opt out, that you can go it alone, or that you can engineer uncertainty out of it.

> "You can't get to courage without rumbling with vulnerability. Embrace the suck."

**Quick Take**: Vulnerability isn't weakness—it's your greatest competitive advantage as a leader.

**2. Living into Our Values**
This isn't just professing values but practicing them, especially when it's hard. Brown introduces "Living BIG"—setting Boundaries, being Generous in your assumptions, and staying in your Integrity. The most effective leaders can name no more than two core values that guide their leadership and decision-making. When you're clear on your values, you can make tough decisions with confidence and communicate your reasoning to others.

> "Integrity is choosing courage over comfort; it's choosing what's right over what's fun, fast, or easy; and it's practicing your values, not just professing them."

**Quick Take**: Your values aren't what you believe—they're what you do, especially when it's difficult.

**3. Braving Trust**
Trust isn't built through grand gestures but through small, consistent moments over time. Brown introduces the BRAVING framework as a practical tool for understanding and building trust:

- **B**oundaries: You respect my boundaries and ask when unclear
- **R**eliability: You do what you say you'll do, staying aware of your limitations
- **A**ccountability: You own mistakes, apologize, and make amends
- **V**ault: You don't share information that's not yours to share
- **I**ntegrity: You choose courage over comfort and practice your values
- **N**onjudgment: We can ask for help without judgment
- **G**enerosity: You extend the most generous interpretation to others' intentions

> "Trust is earned in small moments. Trust is the stacking of small moments over time."

**Quick Take**: Trust is like a marble jar—every small gesture adds a marble, while betrayals remove handfuls.

**4. Learning to Rise**
This skill set is about resilience and getting back up after failure. Brown outlines a three-step process: the reckoning (acknowledging emotions and stories), the rumble (getting honest about what's real), and the revolution (transforming how you live and lead). The key insight is that we must teach people how to land before they jump—building resilience skills before failure occurs, not after. The most powerful tool in this process is learning to say, "The story I'm telling myself is..." This simple phrase transforms conflicts by acknowledging that you're dealing with your interpretation, not objective reality.

> "When we fail, we normally rumble with the stories we make up about what happened, what it means, and what it says about us. The story-making process is normal and necessary—without stories, information is just data."

**Quick Take**: Failure isn't the end of the story—it's the middle of the process of becoming more resilient.

## Best Quotes
- "What stands in the way becomes the way." — Marcus Aurelius
- "Courage is contagious. To scale daring leadership and build courage in teams and organizations, we have to cultivate a culture in which brave work, tough conversations, and whole hearts are the expectation."
- "Vulnerability minus boundaries is not vulnerability. It's confession, manipulation, desperation, or shock and awe, but it's not vulnerability."
- "Strong back is grounded confidence and boundaries. The soft front is staying vulnerable and curious. The mark of a wild heart is living out these paradoxes in our lives."
- "Trust is the stacking of small moments over time, something that cannot be summoned with a command—there are either marbles in the jar or there are not."

## Action Items
- **Identify your two core values**: Write down what matters most to you as a leader, then narrow it to your top two—these should guide every decision you make
- **Practice "The story I'm telling myself"**: Use this phrase in your next difficult conversation to separate facts from your interpretation
- **Conduct a BRAVING inventory**: Schedule a conversation with a team member to discuss where trust is strong and where it needs building using the seven elements
- **Set one boundary**: Identify where you're overextending yourself and practice saying "no" or "not now" with kindness and clarity
- **Ask for help**: Model vulnerability by asking for assistance on something you're struggling with—this builds trust and gives others permission to do the same

## Questions to Consider
- What story are you telling yourself about your leadership abilities, and how might that story be limiting your potential?
- Where are you choosing comfort over courage in your leadership, and what small step could you take to move toward courage?
- How are you building trust in small moments with your team, and where might trust be eroding without your awareness?
- What values are you professing but not fully practicing in your day-to-day leadership?
- Are you teaching your team how to "land" before encouraging them to "jump" into brave work?

## Conclusion
"Dare to Lead" is worth your time because it fundamentally changes how you think about leadership—from a position of authority to a practice of courage. Brown provides both the philosophical framework and practical tools needed to build more courageous cultures where people can bring their whole selves to work. The biggest reason to read this book is that it offers a research-backed roadmap for developing the specific skills that separate good leaders from truly brave ones. In an era of unprecedented complexity and change, courage isn't optional—it's essential, and this book shows you exactly how to develop it.
