# How to Scalp the Mini DAX Future

**Authors**: Heikin Ashi Trader | **Year**: 2018
**Category**: Business & Finance

## Summary
This practical guide introduces traders to scalping the Mini DAX Future using the Heikin Ashi charting technique. The author presents a counter-trend approach that capitalizes on Newton's third law of action and reaction in financial markets. Rather than predicting market movements, the method waits for clear trends to develop and then trades the expected counter-movements (corrections) that naturally follow.

This book is ideal for day traders looking to transition from forex or US futures to European markets, as well as existing DAX traders wanting to adopt the mini-contract for smaller position sizing. Readers will gain a complete scalping framework including entry strategies, exit techniques, stop management, and practical tools for precise execution in fast-moving markets.

## Core Insights

### The Action-Reaction Trading Philosophy
The core principle of this scalping method is based on Newton's third law: for every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction. When you observe a strong, clear market movement (action), you can reasonably expect a counter-movement (reaction) to follow. The key is trading these reactions rather than trying to predict the initial movements.

> "If I observe a clear movement in the chart, I can almost always expect a counter-movement to the previous movement. In other words, I missed the upward trend, because I could not reliably foresee it. If this motion is clear and large enough, I can expect a corresponding counter-movement."

**Quick Take**: Don't chase trends—wait for exhaustion points and trade the natural corrections that follow significant moves.

### Heikin Ashi Charts: The Complete Toolkit
Heikin Ashi charts are both chart and indicator combined, making them ideal for scalping without additional technical indicators. The smoothed candlesticks clearly show trend direction, momentum strength, and reversal points through candle colors, body sizes, and shadow patterns.

> "The Heikin Ashi chart is basically already a kind of indicator. It is a chart and indicator all rolled into one. I therefore do not need additional indicators as a filter for my signals."

**Quick Take**: Master Heikin Ashi reading—white candles indicate buying pressure, black candles show selling pressure, and shadow patterns reveal potential reversals.

### The 3-Element Setup for Valid Counter-Trend Trades
A tradable counter-trend setup requires three specific conditions: (1) The preceding movement must be large enough (minimum 15-20 points at 10,000 DAX level), (2) Momentum must show significant weakening through smaller candles or failure to make new highs/lows, and (3) Reversal patterns must appear such as dojis, spinning tops, or long shadows.

> "The conditions must be met: The preceding movement should be large enough, there must be a significant weakening of the momentum, and signs of top or bottom formation must occur."

**Quick Take**: Exercise patience—trade only setups that meet all three criteria rather than settling for marginal opportunities.

### Risk Management: The 5-Ticket Philosophy
The author advocates for very tight stops (typically 5 points) because scalping depends on immediate market confirmation. If the market doesn't move in your favor within minutes, exit quickly. The goal is to minimize losses on losing trades while maximizing gains on winning trades that develop strong momentum.

> "Either the market moves immediately in my favor, or I want to be out. Losses are part of the game. And if I will produce losses anyway and I have the choice between a small loss and a greater loss, then I have no difficulty in making my decision."

**Quick Take**: Be ruthless with losing positions—scalping rewards quick decisions more than patience with wrong trades.

### Exit Strategy: Color Changes and Warning Signs
The primary exit rule is to remain in positions as long as Heikin Ashi candles maintain their color (white for longs, black for shorts). Additional exit signals include candle color changes, momentum shifts, and warning signs like shadows appearing against the trend direction. The goal is to capture as much of the correction as possible without giving back significant gains.

> "The main rule when Heiken-Ashi scalping says: remain in the position as long as the color of the candle does not change. If a white candle arises, buyers take over control for the period of this candle. I recommend you close the position."

**Quick Take**: Exit at the first sign of trend weakness—don't wait for perfect reversals or try to squeeze every last point.

### Advanced Stop Management Techniques
The book introduces several sophisticated stop orders including trailing stops, linear stops (tightening by time), time stops (automatic closure after set periods), and parabolic stops (accelerating with momentum). These tools help scalpers automate position management and reduce emotional decision-making.

> "Ultimately, it is always a question of developing the exit strategy that best fits the method and the personality of the scalper. Many will keep at a fixed stop, but other traders could take advantage of a linear or a parabolic stop."

**Quick Take**: Use automated stops to enforce discipline—manual adjustments in fast markets often lead to poor decisions.

### The European Morning Trading Window
The optimal time for Mini DAX scalping is 9:00-12:00 CET when European markets operate independently. This period offers the best volatility patterns and liquidity without American influence. The author also advises avoiding economic news releases and central bank announcements, which typically create poor trading conditions.

> "The best time to scalp the DAX is a well known fact. It is the European morning, 09:00 to 12:00 CET. This is the time when the Europeans are 'among themselves'."

**Quick Take**: Focus trading during the European morning session—this window consistently provides the best conditions for counter-trend scalping.

### Professional Trading Tools Advantage
Modern trading platforms like NanoTrader provide scalpers with crucial advantages including one-click order placement, advanced stop management, order book integration, and automated position sizing. These tools help scalpers execute with precision and manage multiple positions efficiently in fast-moving markets.

> "Each point, each tic it wins by accuracy, increases its profitability or makes it possible. Even though the scalper performs many trades, a tick more or less is important."

**Quick Take**: Invest in professional trading technology—the execution advantages compound significantly over hundreds of trades.

### Account Size and Position Management
The Mini DAX Future requires approximately €5,000 account minimum for meaningful trading, allowing traders to withstand inevitable losing streaks. At €5 per point, a 10-point stop risks only €50 per contract, making it accessible to smaller accounts while still providing meaningful profit potential.

> "Meaningful trading in mini DAX futures in my eyes starts only when you have a balance of $5,000. With a 10-point stop you risk losing only 50 Euros."

**Quick Take**: Maintain adequate capitalization—trading with insufficient account size creates unnecessary stress and poor decision-making.

## Best Quotes
- "The most underrated secret is, knowing when you should go to the market and when not."
- "Exit strategies belong to the most difficult part of the trading business. Finally, here, the money is made although it is not with the entries, which the vast majority of beginners think."
- "A proficient scalper, who does not act according to the technical analysis, would perhaps have taken a part of this movement and after some consolidation, he probably would have traded the market on the long side over and over again."
- "The opportunity factor is the real strength of this trading style. A scalper may manage his capital more effectively than all other market participants."
- "Even very experienced traders do not stop to learn. A trader or scalper is therefore someone who works permanently on his exit strategy."

## Action Items

## Conclusion
This book provides a complete, practical framework for scalping the Mini DAX Future using a counter-trend approach based on action-reaction principles. The Heikin Ashi technique offers traders a clear visual method for identifying trend exhaustion and reversal points without the complexity of multiple indicators.

The biggest strength of this approach is its simplicity and focus on high-probability setups rather than trying to predict market movements. By waiting for clear trends to develop and trading the natural corrections that follow, scalpers can achieve consistent results without the psychological pressure of constantly being right about market direction.
