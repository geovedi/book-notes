# Freedom - Ukraine Between NATO and Russia from Independence to Today
**Original Title**: SVOBODA - Ucraina fra NATO e Russia dall'indipendenza a oggi
**Author**: Yurii Colombo | **Year**: 2018 (Updated 2022)

## Summary
"Freedom" is a comprehensive Marxist analysis of Ukraine's tumultuous journey from Soviet republic to independent nation caught between East and West. Colombo traces Ukraine's complex history through the Soviet period, independence in 1991, the Orange Revolution, Maidan protests, Crimea's annexation, war in Donbass, and finally the 2022 Russian invasion. The book argues that Ukraine's tragic destiny stems from a combination of Russian neo-imperial ambitions, Western exploitation, corrupt domestic leadership, and the toxic legacy of Soviet Stalinism.

This book is essential for readers seeking to understand the Ukraine-Russia conflict beyond simplistic propaganda, offering a historical materialist perspective on how Ukraine became the flashpoint in a new Cold War between NATO and an increasingly authoritarian Russia.

## Core Insights

### The Soviet Legacy of Oppression
The book reveals how Soviet policies, particularly under Stalin, created deep wounds in Ukrainian society that never fully healed. The forced collectivization of the 1930s led to the Holodomor—a famine that killed millions—and a systematic policy of Russification that suppressed Ukrainian language and culture. Even during the post-Stalin "thaw," Ukraine remained essentially a colony of Moscow, with its leadership subservient to the Kremlin.

> "The errors and crimes of Soviet power soon produced wounds on the social body of the Ukrainian people that would prove difficult to heal."
> _Original: "Gli errori e i crimini del potere sovietico portarono ben presto a produrre delle ferite sul corpo sociale del popolo ucraino difficilmente rimarginabili."_

**Quick Take**: Soviet repression created the conditions for both Ukrainian nationalism and pro-Russian sentiment that would later tear the country apart.

### The Illusion of Independence
Colombo argues that Ukraine's 1991 independence brought hope but little genuine freedom. The country quickly fell under the influence of Western financial institutions like the IMF, which imposed neoliberal policies that devastated the economy. Meanwhile, corrupt oligarchs—many former Soviet officials—plundered state assets during chaotic privatizations, creating a neo-feudal system where a tiny elite controlled most wealth and political power.

> "We have made Ukraine, now we must make Ukrainians."
> _Original: "Abbiamo fatto l'Ucraina ora dobbiamo fare gli ucraini."_ —Leonid Kučma, Ukraine's first Prime Minister

**Quick Take**: Without genuine economic sovereignty and democratic institutions, independence became a hollow victory benefiting only a small elite.

### The Color Revolutions: False Dawn
The Orange Revolution (2004) and Maidan protests (2014) initially seemed like democratic breakthroughs, but Colombo presents them as ultimately serving Western geopolitical interests rather than Ukrainian popular sovereignty. While these movements mobilized genuine popular discontent with corruption and Russian influence, they often empowered pro-Western elites who continued the same neoliberal policies while integrating Ukraine into NATO's expansion eastward.

> "The 2014 Maidan revolution was of opposite sign to May '68 in Paris, and the red and black flags were not anarchist but those of Pravyi Sektor, the 'banderite' far-right organization."
> _Original: "La rivolta di Kyjiv era di segno opposto e le bandiere rossonere non erano anarchiche ma di Pravyi Sektor, l'organizzazione 'banderista' di estrema destra."_

**Quick Take**: Popular uprisings were co-opted by both far-right nationalists and Western interests, undermining their democratic potential.

### Putin's Neo-Imperial Adventure
The book presents Russia's 2022 invasion as a desperate gambit by a declining neo-feudal regime to restore Russian greatness through military conquest. Putin's regime, described as a "rapacious clique" rather than a revival of Soviet power, seeks to reverse Russia's post-Cold War decline by reestablishing a sphere of influence over former Soviet territories. Colombo emphasizes that this invasion is fundamentally reactionary, despite Putin's claims of "denazification."

> "The class gathered around Putin is only a rapacious neo-feudal clique—protected and defended by the FSB and the army—born from the privatizations of the 1990s and the dismantling of the Soviet social state."
> _Original: "La classe dirigente raccolta intorno a Putin è solo una rapace cricca neofeudale – protetta e difesa dal FSB (Servizio federale per la sicurezza) e dall'esercito – sorta dalle privatizzazioni degli anni Novanta e dallo smantellamento dello stato sociale sovietico."_

**Quick Take**: Russia's invasion reflects desperation rather than strength—a last-ditch effort by a corrupt regime to maintain power through foreign conquest.

### Ukraine as Semi-Colonial Battleground
Perhaps the book's most powerful argument is that Ukraine has become a semi-colonial territory where great powers compete for influence and resources, while ordinary Ukrainians bear the terrible cost. The country serves as a market for Western weapons, a source of cheap labor for Europe, and a geopolitical buffer against Russia—yet its people remain among Europe's poorest, with many unable to afford basic necessities despite the country's rich resources.

> "The hopes following 1991 independence have turned into a nightmare with no end in sight. Imperial appetites, neoliberal programs, corruption and incompetence of its ruling classes have sealed its failure. Freedom, svoboda, has not arrived."
> _Original: "Le speranze seguite all'indipendenza del 1991 si sono trasformate in un incubo di cui non si vede la fine. Appetiti imperialisti, programmi neoliberali, corruzione e incompetenza delle sue classi dirigenti ne hanno decretato il fallimento. La libertà, la svoboda, non è arrivata."_

**Quick Take**: Genuine Ukrainian sovereignty remains impossible as long as the country remains a pawn in great power competition.

## Key Takeaways

## Questions to Consider

- How might Ukraine's history have differed if Soviet policies had been less repressive toward Ukrainian national identity?
- Could genuine popular sovereignty emerge in Ukraine without outside interference from both East and West?
- What alternative economic models might have prevented Ukraine's descent into oligarchic corruption?
- Is Ukraine's partition or neutral status the only realistic path to peace, or can genuine independence be achieved?
- How does the Marxist framework help or hinder understanding of nationalist dynamics in Ukraine?

## Conclusion
Colombo's "Freedom" is a sobering analysis that challenges readers to look beyond the binary propaganda of both Russian and Western narratives about Ukraine. The book's greatest strength is its systematic historical materialist approach, tracing how Ukraine's current tragedy emerges from the intersection of Soviet history, neoliberal economics, and great power geopolitics.

While some may find the Marxist framework overly deterministic, and the analysis sometimes minimizes genuine popular democratic aspirations, the book powerfully demonstrates how Ukraine has become a tragic battleground where competing imperial ambitions play out, with ordinary people paying the ultimate price. The work is essential reading for anyone seeking to understand the Ukraine crisis beyond headlines and propaganda, though its dense historical detail and Marxist theoretical framework make it challenging for casual readers.

The book's title—"Freedom" (Svoboda)—becomes deeply ironic as Colombo demonstrates how genuine Ukrainian sovereignty remains elusive, caught between Russian neo-imperialism and Western neo-colonialism. As the war continues, the book raises uncomfortable questions about whether any authentic Ukrainian freedom can emerge from the current conflagration, or whether the country's tragic destiny as a geopolitical pawn is sealed.
