# Project Management: The Sketches
**Authors**: Nigel Creaser | **Year**: 2018 | **Category**: Business & Finance

## Summary
This book is a hilarious satirical take on project management culture, using parody sketches inspired by Monty Python to expose the absurdities, hypocrisies, and universal truths of the project management profession. Through twelve comedic sketches, it skewers everything from project lies and status reporting to certification snobbery and methodology wars.

Project managers, PMO staff, and anyone who has ever worked on a project team will recognize themselves and their colleagues in these painfully accurate caricatures. The book serves as both comic relief and a gentle reminder not to take ourselves too seriously in the corporate world.

## Core Insights

### The Seven Kinds of Project Lies
The book opens with a brilliant expansion of Disraeli's famous quote, identifying the seven types of lies that populate project management: "Lies, Damn Lies, Statistics, Project Plans, Estimates, Risk Mitigation Plans and Project Status Reports." Each represents a different way that project communication becomes disconnected from reality, from the optimistic "should be OK" to the classic "it worked on my machine yesterday."

> "I believe there are 3 kinds of lies in this arena 'Lies, Damn Lies and Statistics.'"
> _Original: "I believe there are 3 kinds of lies in this arena 'Lies, Damn Lies and Statistics.'"_

**Quick Take**: Recognition of these patterns helps project managers maintain credibility by acknowledging when they're venturing into these territories.

### The Holy Grail of Project Status
A brilliant Monty Python and the Holy Grail parody shows the absurd battles over RAG status reporting. The Green Knight PM refuses to change his status to Red despite losing funding, resources, and timeline, insisting "The project is green" while facing increasingly dire circumstances. This highlights how status reporting often becomes disconnected from reality.

> "The Green Knight PM always delivers on time, to budget and scope! Have at you! Come on then."

**Quick Take**: Status reports should reflect reality, not wishful thinking—otherwise they become meaningless exercises in political maneuvering.

### Methodology Wars: The Scrum Sketch
The book brilliantly satirizes the methodology obsession in modern project management, particularly the Scrum fetishization. A receptionist lists endless methodology combinations: "waterfall and lean; waterfall, agile and lean; waterfall and Scrum; waterfall, lean and Scrum..." with Java developers chanting "Scrum, Scrum, Scrum" in the background.

> "I don't want ANY Scrum!"

**Quick Take**: Choose methodologies based on project needs, not trends or tribal affiliations—the goal is project success, not methodological purity.

### Professional Body Snobbery
The book exposes the ridiculous hierarchy among project management certifications through a class-system sketch where PMPs look down on PMQs, who look down on PRINCE2 practitioners, creating an artificial caste system based on credentials rather than capability.

> "I look down on him because I have a global project management certification."

**Quick Take**: True project management competence comes from experience and results, not from the collection of post-nominal letters.

### The "What Have Project Managers Ever Done for Us?" Sketch
In a brilliant parody of the "What have the Romans ever done for us?" sketch, managers plot against project managers only to realize they've brought: "The Kanban board, budgetary control, risk management, quality management, change control, communication strategy, stakeholder analysis, Gantt charts, daily stand-ups" and ultimately, "project success."

> "What!? Oh... Project Success …. oh sod off!"

**Quick Take**: Project management often goes unappreciated until it's gone—these functions provide essential structure and governance that organizations take for granted.

The biggest reason to read it is that it will make you laugh at the absurdities we all navigate daily while providing insight into why project management culture often seems disconnected from reality.

The sketches work because they're painfully accurate—they highlight the universal truths and hypocrisies that exist in almost every project environment.
