### We Assume Others Will Say No
- Underestimating Help Responses
  - People often underestimate how likely others are to comply with direct requests for help.
  - Studies by Vanessa Bohns reveal significant discrepancies between predicted and actual help rates.
  - Participants consistently anticipate lower rates of compliance than what actually occurs.
- Factors Influencing Underestimation
  - Perspective-taking failure contributes to underestimation; focus on inconveniences to helpers.
  - Ignoring discomfort caused by refusing help; potential helpers face social pressure to say yes.
  - Participants' self-centeredness and lack of considering others' perspectives hinder accurate predictions.
- Effect of Prior Rejections
  - Repeatedly refusing requests creates discomfort and guilt for potential helpers.
  - Individuals who initially reject a request are more likely to help in subsequent requests.
  - Door-in-the-face technique leverages this discomfort to increase compliance to subsequent requests.
- Cognitive Dissonance and Help Requests
  - Cognitive dissonance theory explains the desire for internal consistency in beliefs and actions.
  - Helpers tend to continue helping after an initial yes to maintain consistent self-image.
  - Foot-in-the-door technique capitalizes on cognitive dissonance to increase compliance to larger requests.
- Impact of Underestimation on Asking for Help
  - People's intuitions about receiving help are often inaccurate.
  - Most individuals find it challenging to predict others' willingness to assist.
  - Understanding that people are generally more willing to help than anticipated can ease discomfort in seeking help.
- Final Reflections
  - Help seekers tend to assume that people are less likely to help than they actually are.
  - Reciprocal nature of help, discomfort with refusal, and cognitive dissonance drive increased willingness to assist.
  - Recognizing these psychological factors can alleviate the apprehension of seeking assistance.
- Importance of Remembering
  - Help seekers should remember that others are more likely to provide assistance than they expect.
  - Overestimating the reluctance of potential helpers can hinder the asking-for-help process.
- Overall Message
  - The tendency to underestimate the willingness of others to help is widespread.
  - People should acknowledge the higher likelihood of receiving assistance and overcome their apprehensions.
  - Recognizing the psychological dynamics of help-seeking can foster a more supportive environment.

### We Assume Asking for Help Makes Us Less Likable

  - Benjamin Franklin observed human behavior and identified character virtues for moral perfection.
  - Franklin's story about seeking help from an opponent reveals cognitive dissonance.
  - Cognitive dissonance theory explains that people resolve conflicting thoughts by changing their attitudes.
- Effects of Seeking and Giving Help:
  - People often fear asking for help due to concerns about appearing less competent or likable.
  - Research shows that asking for help doesn't make people like you less; helpers tend to like those they've helped.
  - Givers experience a "warm glow" and improved mood when helping others.
  - Helping can alleviate guilt and negative emotions, leading to a better mood.
- Impact of Giving on Life Satisfaction:
  - Givers, who frequently help others without seeking personal gain, experience higher life satisfaction.
  - Small acts of giving, like offering directions, can improve well-being.
  - Spending money on others increases happiness more than spending on oneself.
- Benefits of Asking for Help:
  - Not asking for help can deprive others of the chance to experience the benefits of helping.
  - Asking for help provides an opportunity for others to feel good about themselves and you.

  - Ambiguous situations make it difficult to identify when help is required.
  - Making sure others notice your need is the first step to receiving help.

  - Unwritten social norms can influence whether help is perceived as welcome.
  - Directly asking for help is effective in overcoming the assumption that others would ask if they needed assistance.
- Taking Responsibility for Helping:
  - Diffusion of responsibility occurs when there are many potential helpers, leading to uncertainty about who should act.
  - Bystander effect: The more bystanders, the less likely anyone is to offer help.
  - Making a clear, direct request to an individual increases their sense of responsibility.
  - Avoid group requests for help, as they can diminish the sense of personal responsibility.
- Balancing Commitments and Providing Help:
  - People are often busy and have their own commitments to manage.
  - Clear and reasonable requests for help are more likely to be considered.
  - Being open to different forms of help is important, as individuals might not be able to fulfill the initial request.
