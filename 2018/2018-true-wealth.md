## Summary
"True Wealth" is a spiritual guide to reprogramming your subconscious mind for financial success. Wallace argues that true wealth encompasses more than just money—it includes health, relationships, and overall life satisfaction. The book reveals how our subconscious programming from childhood creates limiting beliefs about money that prevent us from achieving financial freedom.

This book is perfect for anyone struggling with chronic financial issues, negative money mindsets, or those who want to understand the psychological barriers to wealth. Readers will learn practical techniques to overcome financial fears, create effective affirmations, and align their conscious and subconscious minds for lasting prosperity.

## Core Insights

### Your Financial Programming Controls Everything
Your subconscious mind controls 95% of your thoughts and actions, including your financial behaviors. Most of us received poor financial programming during childhood that continues to sabotage our adult financial success. These "life tapes" play continuously in the background, influencing every money decision you make without your awareness.

> "Even if you won the lottery tomorrow your problems wouldn't be solved. You'd go back to being just as broke as you are right now. Why? Because of poor subconscious programming."

**Quick Take**: Financial success isn't about finding better strategies—it's about rewriting the underlying programs that drive your money decisions.

### The 4 Stages of Financial Fear Keep You Stuck
Financial anxiety follows a predictable pattern: Stage 1 involves external triggers (bills, expenses), Stage 2 features negative self-talk about money, Stage 3 creates emotional responses (anxiety, panic), and Stage 4 results in poor financial decisions that reinforce the cycle. Most people only recognize their fear at Stage 3, when it's already too late to make rational choices.

> "Too often we go through life kicking and screaming, annoyed and irritated, because we aren't where we want to be in life. Again, this creates resistance and your subconscious will refuse to budge."

**Quick Take**: Breaking the cycle requires recognizing your triggers and self-talk before they spiral into emotional decision-making.

### True Wealth vs. Rich Thinking
Many wealthy people are actually "poor rich"—they have money but lack true wealth in health, relationships, and life satisfaction. True wealth involves alignment between your thoughts, speech, and actions. You can meditate and repeat affirmations all day, but if your daily self-talk is negative or you constantly complain about lacking resources, you'll remain stuck.

> "The truth is, there are a whole lot of poor rich people. They think negative thoughts, act negatively, and aren't living a life of true wealth."

**Quick Take**: Wealth is a holistic state that encompasses every area of life, not just your bank account.

### Affirmations Must Connect to Deep Desires
Most affirmations fail because they focus on wanting money rather than why you want it. Your subconscious needs specific, emotionally charged reasons to become motivated. Instead of "I want more money," effective affirmations connect to the feelings and experiences money will provide—security, freedom, time with loved ones, or the ability to pursue your passions.

> "You need to stoke the flames of desire within your subconscious. You must get it interested and paying attention."

**Quick Take**: Your affirmations should focus on the emotional benefits of financial freedom, not just the dollar amount.

### Create Impressions of Wealth Now
Start living as though you're already wealthy by making small but significant changes in your daily habits. This means choosing quality over quantity, investing in self-care, removing clutter from your life, and treating yourself with respect. These actions signal to your subconscious that you deserve abundance and are ready to receive it.

> "How can you live a life of true wealth if you stuff your body full of junk food? How can you live a life of true wealth if your home is cluttered with things that aren't beautiful or functional?"

**Quick Take**: Act like someone who already has true wealth, and your subconscious mind will help create that reality.

## Best Quotes

- "I'll be honest, if you're looking for a way to get rich quickly, it's not going to happen. Even if you won the lottery tomorrow your problems wouldn't be solved. You'd go back to being just as broke as you are right now. Why? Because of poor subconscious programming."

- "You might be asking yourself, 'If it's that easy, why isn't everyone wealthy? Is it because there's not enough money to go around?' Nope. Even though the economy is tough right now there's still plenty of money and other things to create a wealthy lifestyle for everyone."

- "Start saving every dime, nickel, or penny you have. Keep it in a jar like I did and once a month or so deposit that into your savings account—even if it's only five bucks. Tell yourself, 'I'm doing great financially. I'm even saving money!'"

- "The truth is, there are a whole lot of poor rich people. They think negative thoughts, act negatively, and aren't living a life of true wealth."
