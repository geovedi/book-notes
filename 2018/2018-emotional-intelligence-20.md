# Emotional Intelligence 2.0
**Authors**: Travis Bradberry, Jean Greaves | **Year**: 2018

## Summary
Emotional Intelligence 2.0 reveals that while we've prioritized IQ for decades, emotional intelligence (EQ) actually determines 58% of our performance success. Only 36% of people can accurately identify their emotions as they happen - the rest are ruled by feelings they don't understand. This book provides a practical framework with 66 specific strategies to develop your EQ through four core skills: self-awareness, self-management, social awareness, and relationship management.

Perfect for professionals, leaders, and anyone who wants to transform their emotional "instincts" into intentional responses that build stronger relationships and better decision-making. You'll learn why people with high EQ earn an average of $29,000 more annually and gain concrete tools to immediately improve how you handle emotions in yourself and others.

## Core Insights

### The EQ Advantage: Why Feelings Matter More Than IQ
Traditional intelligence (IQ) measures how well you learn, but emotional intelligence (EQ) determines how well you use what you learn. Research shows EQ is completely learnable through practice, unlike IQ which remains relatively fixed. The book introduces four essential EQ skills that work together: personal competence (self-awareness + self-management) and social competence (social awareness + relationship management). Studies reveal that 83% of people with high self-awareness are top performers, proving emotional mastery directly impacts workplace success.

> "Emotions can become so intense that we prefer acting before thinking, this is when emotional hijacks happen."
**Quick Take**: Your emotions aren't your enemy - they're data. The key is learning to interpret that data before you act on it.

### Self-Awareness: Understanding Your Emotional Operating System
Self-awareness is the foundation that makes all other EQ skills possible. It consists of identifying emotions as they occur and understanding your reaction patterns. High self-awareness people recognize their emotional triggers, understand how feelings affect their body, and can observe their reactions objectively. The book shares 15 practical strategies including observing the ripple effect your emotions create on others, leaning into uncomfortable feelings rather than avoiding them, and keeping an emotion journal to spot patterns over time.

> "Not being able to acknowledge your positive and negative feelings will cause your unacknowledged emotions to resurface and damage you."
**Quick Take**: You can't manage what you don't notice. Start paying attention to how you feel - without judgment - in real time.

### Self-Management: Choosing Your Response, Not Reacting
Self-management uses your self-awareness to control how you behave toward others and situations. This isn't about suppressing emotions but responding thoughtfully rather than reacting impulsively. Key strategies include creating an emotion vs. reason list when facing difficult decisions, counting to ten before responding to triggers, practicing proper breathing techniques to stay calm, and visualizing yourself succeeding in emotionally challenging situations. The book also emphasizes the importance of quality sleep hygiene and regular mental recharge time.

> "Understanding your emotions will allow you to respond to situations in a way that you will control even the most difficult situations."
**Quick Take**: Between stimulus and response lies your power to choose. Use that pause intentionally.

### Social Awareness: Reading Others Like an Expert
Social awareness is the ability to sense others' emotions and understand their perspectives. This skill requires moving beyond your own feelings to observe what's happening with others. The book recommends 17 strategies including greeting people by name, watching body language carefully, avoiding note-taking during meetings to focus on people instead, and practicing "people watching" in public places to sharpen your observation skills. Understanding cultural differences and learning to read the mood of an entire room are also crucial for advanced social awareness.

> "Being in the present is the key to social awareness."
**Quick Take**: Stop planning your response while others are talking. Focus first on understanding, then on being understood.

### Relationship Management: Building Bonds That Last
Relationship management integrates all previous EQ skills to create strong, productive connections with others. This includes being open and curious about others, taking feedback well, building trust through consistency, and having the courage to tackle tough conversations constructively. The book emphasizes avoiding mixed signals between your words and body language, remembering the "little things" like saying thank you, and explaining your decisions rather than just making them. When conversations break down, skilled managers offer "fix-it" statements to get communication back on track.

> "Having a high level of relationship management is important in order to provide the sustainable connection needed with other people."
**Quick Take**: Relationships aren't accidents - they're built through intentional daily choices to prioritize connection over being right.

## Best Quotes
- "Small improvements on the EQ can cause big effects on critical skills like time management, communication, as well as decision making. It's not a well-known fact that 58% of our performance is based on EQ."
- "Emotions that are prolonged can trigger an event and our reactions towards those triggers will be based on our previous choices. A well-developed EQ will help us become more aware of these triggers and respond accordingly."
- "Change, of course, starts from within giving way to self-awareness. Then we can respond appropriately to situations by our self-management skill."
- "EQ is completely different from IQ, in which case EQ is a learnable skill whereas IQ is relatively permanent."
