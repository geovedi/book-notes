# 2018 Emotional Strength Training

**Authors**: James J. Stamatelos | **Year**: 2018

## Summary
Emotional Strength Training offers a revolutionary approach to overcoming fear and anxiety by shifting from rational analysis to emotional transformation. Rather than fighting fear-based beliefs with logic—a method that often triggers defensive responses—EST teaches you to access states of inner strength through powerful emotional anchors called "Strength-Phrases." This technique works with your brain's natural wiring, calming the amygdala (fear center) and engaging the prefrontal cortex (rational mind).

This book is essential for anyone trapped in cycles of self-doubt, anxiety, or fear-based decision-making. Readers will learn how to break free from the "golden age of fear" we live in and reclaim control over their emotional states, enabling them to take authentic risks and pursue their true desires.

## Core Insights

### The Neuroscience Behind Fear and Strength
The human brain's primary job is survival, handled by the limbic system (emotional center) and amygdala (fear center). When we're in fear, the amygdala takes over, forcing reactive, short-term solutions. This creates a vicious cycle: the more we activate fear regions, the more we remain trapped. Emotional Strength Training bypasses this by shifting into strength states, allowing the prefrontal cortex to re-engage and provide better solutions.

> "Like a ship's captain who had decided to reclaim the helm and take back control of his ship from the wind and waves, I focused all my attention on this phrase."
**Quick Take**: Don't fight fear with logic—shift your emotional state first, then access rational thinking.

### The Strength-Phrase Technique
The core method involves identifying emotionally resonant phrases that evoke feelings of strength, competence, and worthiness. These phrases aren't just positive affirmations—they're carefully selected statements that create visceral emotional responses. Examples include "I can handle anything that comes my way," "I am whole and complete," and "Everything I need is within me."

> "I alone create my life. It wasn't a nice, 'feel good' statement I randomly heard. It was a phrase that evoked a deep emotional response from within me."
**Quick Take**: Choose phrases that make you feel strong, confident, and in control—not ones that sound nice but feel hollow.

### The "Sinking In" Meditation Practice
This focused meditation involves repeating your Strength-Phrase continuously while giving it your complete attention. The goal is to feel the statement in every cell and bone of your body, allowing it to become the only thing that exists in your consciousness. This typically takes 2-5 minutes and creates measurable physiological changes: slower heart rate, relaxed breathing, and release of muscle tension.

> "In less than two minutes I started to experience physical, mental and emotional changes. My shoulders loosened as my heart began to slow and my breathing relaxed."
**Quick Take**: Focus deeply on one powerful statement until it becomes your reality—distraction-free immersion is key.

### The 21-Day Strength Building Protocol
Building emotional strength requires consistent practice like physical training. The protocol involves three daily components: morning "sinking in" to start from strength, daytime strength-based action with your chosen authentic risk, and evening celebration of victories to reinforce your self-image. This routine creates new neural pathways and habitual strength responses.

> "Emotional strength is like physical strength; building it requires routine attention, practice and effort. Dramatic improvements can be seen after just 21 to 30 days of focused action."
**Quick Take**: Consistency over intensity—daily practice creates lasting change more effectively than occasional intense effort.

### Taking Authentic Risks
Emotional strength enables what most people fear most: authentic risks—actions that force vulnerable truth-sharing without guaranteed success. Fear keeps us safe in known territory, while strength frees us to pursue what truly matters. The book shows through real examples how starting from strength allows people to save marriages, change careers, and become their authentic selves.

> "Starting from a place of emotional strength didn't just help clients make exceptional progress in short periods of time. It also allowed them to find the ability to do something that most people are terrified of: taking authentic risks."
**Quick Take**: When you know you can handle anything, you're free to pursue everything that matters.

## Best Quotes

- "We are living in a golden age of fear and insecurity. Our constant technological connectivity inundates us with messages of fear at the speed of light."

- "Fear is driven by one thing above all: lack. To lack is to be vulnerable. Fear pushes us to resolve lack because it wants to keep us safe."

- "Strength sees us in an entirely different way than fear. It views us as whole, complete and able to take on anything. Everything we need is already within us."

- "Like a nation of slaves that has finally been pushed to a state of rebellion against their tyrant, these individuals have had enough and refuse to remain in this state any longer."

- "No matter what life throws your way, you have the choice—and now also the ability—to approach it from a place of strength."

## Action Items

1. **Create your Strength-Phrase**: Choose one statement from the examples that creates the strongest emotional response, or craft your own that resonates deeply
2. **Practice the 2-minute "sinking in"**: Daily meditation focusing intensely on your phrase until you feel it throughout your body
3. **Identify one authentic risk**: Choose something meaningful you've been avoiding due to fear—career change, relationship truth, creative project
4. **Implement the 21-day protocol**: Morning meditation, daytime strength-based action, evening celebration of wins
5. **Use the strength assessment**: When facing challenges, shift into strength first, then ask "From this place, how can I best engage with this issue?"

## Questions to Consider

- What authentic risk would you pursue if you knew you could handle anything that comes your way?
- How different would your daily decisions be if you operated from confidence rather than insecurity?
- What evidence do you already have that you're stronger and more capable than you give yourself credit for?
