# Strange Chemistry: The Stories Your Chemistry Teacher Wouldn't Tell You
**Authors**: Steven C. Farmer | **Year**: 2018 | **Category**: Science & Nature

## Summary
"Strange Chemistry" reveals the fascinating, dangerous, and controversial aspects of chemistry that traditional education avoids. Written by a chemistry professor who lost a high school friend to an LSD-related accident, this book makes complex chemical concepts accessible through shocking real-world stories, from deadly toxins to everyday household items. Farmer discovered that roughly 90% of these engaging chemistry stories were learned AFTER completing his formal education—highlighting how traditional teaching misses the most interesting aspects that actually captivate students.

Perfect for curious minds who want to understand how chemistry shapes our world in unexpected ways, this book transforms abstract molecular concepts into unforgettable tales of danger, discovery, and daily life.

## Core Insights

### 🧪 Chemistry Hidden in Plain Sight
Everyday objects contain surprising chemistry that most people never notice. Junior Mints are shiny because they're coated with shellac—a resin secreted by 300,000 female Lac beetles per kilogram. Chewing gum contains petroleum-based polymers also used in bicycle inner tubes, and the "new car smell" comes from volatile organic compounds. Even bananas are naturally radioactive, emitting about 14 decays per second from potassium-40.

> "On multiple occasions, students admitted to me that they only came to class that day so that they could hear the story."

**Quick Take**: Look closer at everyday objects—they're chemistry exhibitions in disguise.

### ☠️ The Deadly Side of Molecules
Many common substances can become lethal with slight molecular changes. Ethylene glycol (antifreeze) tastes sweet but converts to oxalic acid, forming kidney stones that cause fatal kidney failure. The treatment is fascinating—administering large doses of ethanol (alcohol) competes for the same enzyme, allowing the poison to pass harmlessly through the body. One carbon atom can make the difference between safe and deadly: when Chinese manufacturers substituted 1,4-butanediol for 1,5-pentanediol in Aqua Dots toys, children were exposed to GHB production.

> "Botulinum toxin is 40 million times deadlier than cyanide"—yet we inject it into our faces as Botox®.

**Quick Take**: Molecular structure determines toxicity—tiny changes can turn harmless substances into killers.

### 💊 Drugs and the Brain
Chemistry explains why certain drugs are devastatingly addictive. Crack cocaine's power comes from its chemical structure allowing rapid brain penetration, while "bath salts" (synthetic cathinones) caused horrific incidents including the infamous 2012 Miami cannibal attack. The book reveals that the most addictive substance known isn't cocaine or heroin—but rather nicotine, whose withdrawal symptoms are so severe that death can result. Conversely, the only scientifically proven aphrodisiac is testosterone, despite thousands of years of searching for magical substances.

> "How could the ingestion of a molecule cause such profound effects?"

**Quick Take**: Drug effects are determined by molecular interactions with brain chemistry—understand the structure, understand the impact.

### 🛢️ Petroleum's Hidden Empire
Roughly 80% of all pharmaceuticals are made from petroleum-derived molecules, showing our fossil fuel dependency extends far beyond gasoline. Oil saved the whales in the mid-1800s when kerosene replaced whale oil for lighting, collapsing the whaling industry from 735 ships to just 39 in 30 years. Asphalt, the world's most recycled material (99% reuse rate), is so viscous that it takes 8 years for a single drop to fall in the famous pitch drop experiment.

> "Petroleum helped to save the whales" — one of history's great environmental ironies.

**Quick Take**: Petroleum chemistry underpins modern medicine, infrastructure, and even environmental conservation.

### 🍎 Food Chemistry Secrets
Your kitchen is a chemistry lab with surprising processes. Industrial tomato peeling uses concentrated lye at 95°C to dissolve cell walls. Gelatin in gummi bears comes from pig skin, cow hides, and bones. Red food coloring often comes from 70,000 crushed cochineal insects per pound. Americans consume more high-fructose corn syrup than sugar because government protectionism makes US sugar twice as expensive as the rest of the world.

> "Another way to eat insect parts!" — the book's humorous take on carmine red food coloring.

**Quick Take**: Food processing relies on chemical transformations that would shock most consumers.

## Best Quotes
- "Growing up in Northern California was much more curious than one might think... This event had such a profound effect on me that it eventually drove me toward a career in chemistry – I needed to understand what had happened to my friend."
- "Chemistry courses seemed to steer clear of any topic of an edgy, dangerous, or unusual nature... However, these are the topics that many people find exciting."
- "My favorite response, though, came from a student who shouted, 'Money!' This is too bad considering chemists are not known for being rich."
- "Antimatter costs $62.5 trillion per gram — making it the most expensive material known to humanity."
- "I admit, few things have made me feel more educated than seeing a single simple question stump a classroom with over 400 students."

## Action Items
- **Question Everything**: Look at everyday objects and ask "What's the chemistry behind this?"
- **Learn Molecular Thinking**: Understand that molecular structure determines function—from drugs to food additives
- **Safety First**: Recognize that household products can be dangerous with slight modifications or improper use
- **Connect History to Chemistry**: Many scientific discoveries came from investigating accidents, crimes, or unusual events
- **Share Chemistry Stories**: Use real-world examples to make complex concepts accessible and memorable

## Questions to Consider
- Why do chemistry education programs deliberately avoid the most fascinating aspects of the science?
- How has petroleum chemistry shaped modern medicine and environmental history?
- What hidden dangers exist in common household products, and how can molecular understanding prevent accidents?
- How do molecular structures determine whether substances are beneficial, neutral, or deadly?
- What would chemistry education look like if it embraced the "strange" and controversial aspects that naturally interest students?

## Conclusion
**Worth your time? Absolutely.** This book succeeds brilliantly where traditional chemistry education fails—by making the subject genuinely fascinating through real-world stories of danger, discovery, and daily life. Farmer's personal motivation, born from tragedy, drives him to make chemistry accessible and meaningful.

The biggest reason to read this book is its transformation of abstract molecular concepts into unforgettable narratives. You'll never look at a banana, candy coating, or petroleum product the same way again. More importantly, you'll understand how chemistry shapes our world in ways most people never realize—from saving whales to creating deadly street drugs.

Whether you're a student, educator, or curious reader, "Strange Chemistry" delivers on its promise to reveal the stories your chemistry teacher wouldn't tell you—and proves that the most controversial topics often make the best learning tools.
