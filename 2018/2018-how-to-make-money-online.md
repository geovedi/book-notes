## Core Business Models

### 1. Affiliate Marketing
**Concept**: Earn commissions by promoting other people's products without dealing with inventory, customer service, or product delivery.

**How It Works**: As an affiliate, you earn money when customers purchase products through your unique referral links. The system involves four key players: the merchant (product owner), the network (platform connecting affiliates and merchants), the customer, and you (the affiliate publisher).

**Quick Start Strategy**:
- Find products you genuinely use and trust
- Create authentic content through in-depth reviews, tutorials, or blog posts
- Promote via social media, YouTube, or your website
- Focus on building trust with your audience

**Quick Take**: Start with products you already own and love—authenticity drives conversions.

### 2. Training Courses
**Concept**: Monetize your expertise by creating video courses teaching skills people want to learn.

**How It Works**: Create educational content around your skills—whether playing guitar, cooking, programming, or speaking another language. Platforms like Udemy handle payment processing and hosting, or you can sell courses through your own website.

Kennedy's strength lies in his realistic approach: he acknowledges that success requires hard work and persistence, unlike many get-rich-quick schemes. The book serves as an excellent starting point for anyone feeling overwhelmed by the sheer number of online income opportunities.

The biggest value comes from Kennedy's core advice: pick ONE model and master it before diversifying. This focus prevents the common trap of jumping between opportunities without building anything substantial.

**Is this worth your time?** Absolutely if you're new to online business and want a clear overview of your options. It's particularly valuable for avoiding scams and understanding what real online entrepreneurship looks like versus the fantasy often portrayed online.

**The biggest reason to read it**: Kennedy's emphasis on focusing on ONE business model could save you months or years of wasted effort trying to do everything at once. This simple principle alone is worth the price of admission and forms the foundation for successful online entrepreneurship.
