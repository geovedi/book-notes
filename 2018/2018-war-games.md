# War Games: The Psychology of Combat
**Authors**: Leo Murray | **Year**: 2018

## Summary
"War Games" reveals the forgotten psychological principles that determine battlefield success, arguing that modern Western armies have become obsessed with technological killing power while ignoring the human factors that actually make enemies surrender. Drawing on decades of research and combat veteran interviews, Murray demonstrates that throughout history, most battles have been won not through superior firepower but through understanding and exploiting combat psychology.

This book is essential for military professionals, historians, psychologists, and anyone interested in understanding the reality of human conflict. Readers will gain a scientific framework for understanding why soldiers fight or flee, and how psychological tactics can be more effective than sheer firepower.

## Core Insights

### The "Is It Worth It?" Calculation
The central discovery of tactical psychology is that every combat soldier makes a continuous, semi-conscious calculation about whether fighting is worth the risk. This calculation combines fear, common sense, cohesion, and compulsion. When soldiers believe the costs outweigh the benefits, they stop fighting—regardless of their training, ideology, or equipment.

> "Like millions of soldiers before him, he breaks cover for a second to spray a burst of fire towards a bush that might have some enemy behind it. Despite battle inoculation and a basic form of brainwashing, this burst is biased by a primal, almost imperceptible, aversion to killing."

**Quick Take**: Understanding and manipulating this cost-benefit analysis is more effective than trying to overcome it through force or ideology.

### Suppression Works Through Common Sense, Not Fear
Murray overturns conventional military wisdom by showing that artillery and small arms suppression primarily works by giving soldiers rational opportunities to stay safe, not by overwhelming them with terror. The most effective suppression tactics create gaps in fire that allow enemies to withdraw safely, making them 4-5 times more effective than continuous bombardment.

> "In general, if a barrage causes 10 per cent casualties, the defenders will be overwhelmed by almost any ground assault. If a barrage causes as few as 2 or 3 per cent casualties but also offers an escape option, it is likely that the defending force will withdraw."

**Quick Take**: Providing enemies a smart way to escape is often more effective than trying to terrorize them into submission.

### Cohesion is the Strongest Force in Combat
The "cohesion magnet" explains why soldiers tend to copy the behavior of those around them. This means that if you can convince half the enemy soldiers to stop fighting, the other half will likely follow. Cohesion works both ways—it can spread courage as easily as panic.

> "Men tend to follow the example of others and, as in smaller versions of old close-order units, cohesion reinforces whichever behaviour is currently dominant."

**Quick Take**: Focus on breaking the enemy's unit cohesion first, and individual soldiers will follow the group's lead.

### Leadership and Compulsion Trump Motivation
The presence of leaders dramatically increases combat effectiveness. Research shows anti-tank gun crews were up to ten times more effective when supervised by officers or senior sergeants. This isn't about inspiration—it's about the basic human tendency to work harder when authority is watching.

> "Compulsion sometimes needs blatant threats but it is more often an unspoken drive to work harder when the boss is near by."

**Quick Take**: Leadership effectiveness is about proximity and authority, not charismatic inspiration or elaborate speeches.

### Modern Military Equipment Hinders Psychological Warfare
Today's soldiers carry 60-100kg of equipment, making them exhausted before battle begins and unable to execute tactical maneuvers that require speed and agility. This forces reliance on firepower over maneuver, eliminating opportunities to apply psychological tactics.

> "Soldiers are trying to fight while giving a teenager a piggyback."

**Quick Take**: Modern military equipment designed for individual survival actually reduces unit effectiveness by preventing tactical movement.

## Best Quotes

- "War Games is intended to show that we can win by accepting human frailty rather than hiding from it."
- "Every insurgent killed simply inspires two more. Yet we kept on killing. Somehow, the techniques that ordinary soldiers had used to make Nazis surrender weren't tried on Afghan farmhands."
- "This book could save lives: those of our soldiers, next time we ask them to fight; and those of our enemies, if they're lucky."
- "The combination of load, language and no tactical psychology training means that most units are only half applying the confusing side of tactics, and even then this is usually accidental."

## Action Items

- **For Military Commanders**: Train soldiers in tactical psychology as a core combat skill, not as an optional supplement
- **For Defense Planners**: Reduce soldier load to enable tactical movement and maneuver
- **For Infantry Leaders**: Focus on creating opportunities for enemy surrender rather than just maximizing kill ratios
- **For Military Trainers**: Incorporate the "is it worth it" calculation into combat simulations and decision-making exercises
- **For Defense Analysts**: Prioritize psychological effectiveness metrics over pure firepower statistics

## Questions to Consider

1. How might modern military tactics change if commanders accepted that only 15-25% of soldiers actually fire their weapons in combat?
2. What would happen if military procurement decisions were based on psychological effectiveness rather than technical specifications?
3. How can Western armies relearn the psychological tactics that made their predecessors successful in World War II?
4. What are the ethical implications of using sophisticated psychological manipulation in warfare?
5. How might these principles apply to non-military conflicts like business negotiations or political campaigns?

## Conclusion

"War Games" is a revolutionary book that challenges fundamental assumptions about modern warfare. Murray convincingly argues that Western military thinking has become dangerously obsessed with technology and firepower while ignoring the human psychological factors that actually determine battlefield success.

The book's greatest strength is its rigorous blend of historical analysis, psychological research, and combat veteran testimony. Murray doesn't just present theories—he provides quantifiable evidence showing how psychological tactics can be 4-10 times more effective than brute force approaches.

This is essential reading for anyone who wants to understand why technologically superior forces often lose against seemingly weaker opponents. The lessons are particularly relevant given recent conflicts where Western powers have struggled against insurgencies despite overwhelming advantages in equipment and training.

"War Games" offers a practical framework for making warfare more effective and less bloody—if military leaders are willing to accept that human psychology matters more than technological superiority.
