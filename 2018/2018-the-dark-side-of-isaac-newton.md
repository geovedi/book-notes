# The Dark Side of Isaac Newton: Science's Greatest Fraud?
**Original Title**: The Dark Side of Isaac Newton: Science's Greatest Fraud?
**Author**: Nick Kollerstrom | **Year**: 2018

## Summary
This explosive revisionist biography challenges everything you thought you knew about Isaac Newton, arguing that Britain's greatest scientific hero was actually a systematic fraud who built his legendary status through deception, intellectual theft, and character assassination. Kollerstrom meticulously examines Newton's major "discoveries" and concludes that Newton neither discovered universal gravitation nor invented calculus, instead appropriating credit from others while systematically destroying the reputations of rivals who challenged him.

This book is for readers interested in scientific controversy, historical revisionism, and the dark side of genius. You'll gain a provocative new perspective on how scientific myths are created and maintained, and why the "Newton legend" may be one of history's most successful fabrications.

## Core Insights

### The Gravity Fraud
Newton's most famous discovery - universal gravitation - was not actually his discovery at all. Robert Hooke first proposed the inverse-square law and provided compelling evidence, which Newton initially dismissed before later incorporating it without credit. Newton's celebrated "Moon test" calculation was mathematically flawed and inaccurate, while the famous apple story was fabricated over 60 years after the supposed event, likely by Freemasons seeking to create a founding myth.

> "In these pages will be found a graphic, blow-by-blow account of how England's greatest scientist failed to discover the law of gravity. This is a startling new perspective, which challenges the 'official mythmakers.'"

**Quick Take**: Scientific discoveries often have complex, contested origins that get simplified into heroic myths over time.

### The Calculus Conspiracy
The bitter dispute between Newton and Leibniz over calculus invention was won through Newton's political power, not merit. As President of the Royal Society, Newton manipulated the historical record, suppressed evidence of Leibniz's independent development, and used his influence to discredit his German rival. The evidence suggests Leibniz actually developed calculus first, with Newton later adopting similar notation and concepts while claiming priority.

> "Either it is radically mistaken, or it demands that past biographies be thrown away."

**Quick Take**: Power and influence can determine scientific credit as much as actual priority of discovery.

### Character assassination was Newton's signature method
Newton systematically destroyed the reputations of contemporaries who challenged him - Robert Hooke, John Flamsteed, Gottfried Leibniz, and others. He used his positions of authority to suppress their work, appropriate their findings, and write them out of history. This wasn't mere academic rivalry; it was a deliberate strategy to build his own mythic status at others' expense.

> "He was incapable of friendship, love, fatherhood, and many other desirable things. As a man he was a failure; as a monster he was superb." - Aldous Huxley

**Quick Take**: Genius and character are not always connected; brilliant minds can harbor destructive impulses.

### The alchemical secret life
For three decades, Newton pursued alchemy with obsessive intensity, believing he could transform base metals into gold. This wasn't merely a sideline but a central passion that consumed more time and energy than his more celebrated mathematical work. Newton kept his alchemical activities secret because they would have damaged his reputation as a rational scientist, revealing a man torn between modern science and ancient mystical traditions.

> "Six million words have to-date been posted up on the Newton-Project... much of it alchemical or theological texts more inaccessible."

**Quick Take**: Even the greatest scientists often harbor beliefs that contradict their public image.

## Best Quotes

- "If we evolved a race of Isaac Newtons, that would not be progress. For the price Newton had to pay for being a supreme intellect was that he was incapable of friendship, love, fatherhood, and many other desirable things. As a man he was a failure; as a monster he was superb." - Aldous Huxley

- "We here claim that he did not invent, conceive, discover, or even explain the law of gravity – however, he applied it. Likewise, he did not formulate, conceive, or use what we know as Newton's Second Law of Motion."

- "He was the most fearful, cautious and suspicious Temper, that ever I knew." - William Whiston, Newton's successor

- "Either it is radically mistaken, or it demands that past biographies be thrown away."

- "Glorious myths swirl endlessly around the hero and glitter with images of what never happened."

## Key Revelations

- **The apple story** was a complete fabrication, first appearing 60+ years after the supposed event
- **Robert Hooke** actually discovered the inverse-square law of gravity, not Newton
- **The Royal Society** under Newton's presidency became a tool for settling personal scores
- **John Flamsteed's** astronomical data was appropriated without proper credit
- **Freemasonic networks** helped perpetuate the Newton myth after his death

## Questions to Consider

- How many scientific "heroes" have similarly fabricated or exaggerated claims to discovery?
- Why do societies need myths of lone genius rather than acknowledging collaborative, contested processes?
- What happens to scientific progress when credit is determined by power rather than merit?
- Is it possible to appreciate Newton's genuine contributions while acknowledging his destructive methods?
- How many current scientific orthodoxies might eventually be revealed as partially fabricated?

## Conclusion
This book is either complete nonsense or one of the most important scientific histories ever written - there's no middle ground. Kollerstrom makes such radical claims about Newton's fraudulence that if even half are true, they fundamentally overturn centuries of scientific historiography. The evidence is compelling and meticulously documented, though the author's polemical tone sometimes undermines credibility.

Is this worth your time? Absolutely, if you're interested in the dark underbelly of scientific myth-making and the complex relationship between genius, power, and truth. The biggest reason to read it is that it forces you to question not just Newton, but how scientific knowledge itself is constructed and who really gets credit for humanity's greatest discoveries. This isn't just Newton's story - it's about the stories we tell ourselves about how progress really happens.
