# Smart Europe
**Authors**: Jeremy Rifkin | **Year**: 2018

## Summary
Smart Europe presents a visionary roadmap for Europe's transformation into a high-tech green digital economy through the Third Industrial Revolution. This economic paradigm shift is built on three interconnected pillars: a digitalized Communication Internet, a digitalized Renewable Energy Internet, and a digitalized Automated Mobility Internet—all operating on an Internet of Things infrastructure.

This concise guide is essential reading for policymakers, business leaders, and citizens interested in understanding how technological convergence can address climate change, boost productivity, and create a more equitable society. Readers will gain insights into the massive infrastructure transformation ahead and the new governance models needed to manage this transition.

## Core Insights

### The Three Internets Framework
The Third Industrial Revolution is founded on the convergence of three digitalized networks that will transform how Europe manages, powers, and moves economic activity. The Communication Internet handles data exchange, the Renewable Energy Internet distributes clean power, and the Automated Mobility Internet coordinates transportation—all connected through billions of sensors embedded in an Internet of Things infrastructure.

> "Currently, 14 billion sensors are attached to warehouses, road systems, factory production lines, the electricity transmission grid, offices, homes, stores, and vehicles. These sensors continually feed Big Data into the Communication Internet, Energy Internet and Mobility Internet."

**Quick Take**: This interconnected framework will allow for unprecedented optimization of economic activities, potentially reducing marginal costs toward zero for many goods and services.

### The Near-Zero Marginal Cost Revolution
The digital economy has already disrupted information industries with near-zero marginal costs, and this phenomenon is now spreading to physical goods and services. In a Smart Europe, renewable energy, 3D printing, and shared transportation will allow millions of people to produce and exchange goods at minimal cost, fundamentally challenging traditional capitalist models.

> "The near zero marginal cost phenomenon brought the music industry to its knees, shook the television industry, forced newspapers and magazines out of business, and crippled the book publishing market."

**Quick Take**: This shift enables a massive sharing economy where businesses like Google, Facebook, and thousands of other Internet companies thrive by creating the networks that facilitate near-free exchange.

### Infrastructure Transformation Requirements
Transitioning to Smart Europe requires massive infrastructure upgrades: universal 5G broadband and free Wi-Fi, conversion of buildings into micro power plants with renewable energy installations, reconfiguring electricity grids into smart digital networks, and installing millions of electric vehicle charging stations and hydrogen fueling stations.

> "Millions of buildings will need to be retrofitted and equipped with renewable energy harvesting installations and converted into micro power plants."

**Quick Take**: This transformation will create millions of jobs while saving existing positions across manufacturing, engineering, utilities, transport, construction, and real estate sectors.

### The Governance Shift to Subsidiarity
Unlike the centralized, top-down infrastructure of previous industrial revolutions, the Third Industrial Revolution requires distributed, collaborative, open, and laterally-scaled governance. The subsidiarity principle—where decisions start at local, regional, and national levels—is becoming essential as digital revolution connects communities across political boundaries.

> "While the First and Second Industrial Revolutions spawned a more top-down, vertically integrated form of globalisation, the Third Industrial Revolution takes the human family into a more laterally networked framework."

**Quick Take**: This governance model emphasizes broad stakeholder participation and collaborative partnerships between government, business, academia, and civil society.

### The Labor-Intensive Green Transition
Contrary to fears about automation eliminating jobs, the transition to renewable energy and smart infrastructure is extremely labor-intensive. Transforming energy systems, retrofitting buildings, installing storage technologies, and building charging station networks will require millions of European workers and spawn thousands of new businesses.

> "Transforming the energy regime and electricity grid from fossil fuels and nuclear power to solar, wind and other renewable energies is extremely labour-intensive and will also require millions of European workers."

**Quick Take**: The green transition represents a massive employment opportunity that requires retraining existing workforces and preparing students for new job categories.

## Best Quotes
- "Every great economic paradigm has three elements: new communication technologies to manage economic activity; new sources of energy to power economic activity; and new modes of mobility to move economic activity."
- "The vision of millions of families, thousands of communities, and hundreds of thousands of businesses generating their own renewable energy in and around their buildings, at near zero marginal cost, and sharing it with one another across a national and continental renewable Energy Internet changes the very notion of collective responsibility for European society."
- "And if what we do produce is shared—our cars, our homes, our toys—in an emerging sharing/circular economy, nothing needs to go to the landfill, all of which reduces humanity's collective ecological footprint, mitigates climate change, and takes society into an ecological age."

## Action Items
- **Policy Support**: Advocate for infrastructure investments that support the three Internets framework
- **Skill Development**: Pursue training in IoT, renewable energy, and smart mobility technologies
- **Local Participation**: Engage with regional planning initiatives that apply the subsidiarity principle
- **Business Adaptation**: Prepare business models for near-zero marginal cost economics
- **Environmental Stewardship**: Support renewable energy adoption and sharing economy initiatives

## Questions to Consider
1. How can your community prepare for the transition to near-zero marginal cost economics?
2. What skills will be most valuable in the Third Industrial Revolution economy?
3. How can we ensure equitable access to the new Internet of Things infrastructure?
4. What governance structures best support distributed, collaborative economic models?
5. How might the sharing economy transform your industry or profession?

## Conclusion
Smart Europe offers a compelling vision of how technological convergence can create a more sustainable, equitable, and prosperous future. While the infrastructure transformation required is massive, Rifkin presents a plausible roadmap that addresses climate change while creating economic opportunity. The book's greatest strength lies in connecting technological trends to practical implementation strategies through real-world examples from European regions already leading this transition.

For anyone seeking to understand the future of economic development and governance in the digital age, this concise guide provides essential insights. The Third Industrial Revolution framework offers hope that technology can be harnessed for ecological sustainability rather than continued environmental degradation—making this a crucial read for our collective future.
