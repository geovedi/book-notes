# Cryptocurrency ICO Investing: A Quick-Start Guide
**Authors**: Sean Bennett | **Year**: 2018

## Summary
This practical guide demystifies Initial Coin Offerings (ICOs) as a way for investors to get in on the ground floor of new cryptocurrency projects. Unlike Bitcoin's early days under $100, ICOs offer opportunities to invest in the next generation of cryptocurrencies at their lowest possible prices, albeit with significantly higher risk. The book provides a comprehensive framework for evaluating, investing in, and managing ICO investments while understanding the associated tax implications.

Perfect for crypto-curious investors who missed Bitcoin's early boom, this guide equips you with the tools to identify promising projects while avoiding the countless scams in the Wild West of cryptocurrency investing.

## Core Insights

### Understanding ICOs vs IPOs
ICOs are fundamentally different from traditional Initial Public Offerings. While IPOs involve buying equity in established companies through heavily regulated processes, ICOs involve funding cryptocurrency projects with minimal regulatory oversight. When you invest in an ICO, you're essentially becoming a venture capitalist for blockchain projects, funding their development in exchange for early access to their tokens at the lowest possible prices.

> "Those who have found success with ICOs in the past, or who are very positive on cryptocurrency in general, can argue that the process is like an accelerated form of venture capitalism."

**Quick Take**: Think of ICOs as high-risk, high-reward venture capital investments where you're betting on the team and technology rather than buying into established businesses.

### The Altcoin Opportunity
Bitcoin was first but far from perfect. With 10-minute block times, massive energy consumption, and a 21-million-coin limit, altcoins emerged to solve Bitcoin's shortcomings. Successful ICOs create cryptocurrencies that meaningfully improve on the original blockchain technology—either through speed, security, or alternative verification systems.

> "While Bitcoin focuses almost exclusively on P2P payment transactions, Ethereum has instead focused on creating a platform for people to utilize smart contracts to the fullest."

**Quick Take**: Look for ICOs that solve real problems or improve blockchain technology in meaningful ways, not just those trying to be "better Bitcoin."

### Due Diligence Framework
Smart ICO investing requires rigorous research across multiple dimensions. Start with the team's background and track record in cryptocurrency, then examine community engagement on platforms like Bitcointalk.org. Review the whitepaper thoroughly (less than 40% of investors actually do), and check the project's code quality on GitHub. Finally, verify real-world demand for the problem the project aims to solve.

> "As a general rule, the most effective means of determining if a new cryptocurrency is worth investing in is to make sure that it has either been created with a specific application in mind, designed to do something that it is clear people want."

**Quick Take**: Treat each ICO like hiring an employee—vet the team, check references, verify qualifications, and ensure they can actually deliver what they promise.

### Red Flags and Scam Prevention
The cryptocurrency space is rife with scams. Watch for warning signs like anonymous teams, vague whitepapers, unrealistic promises, and artificially generated community buzz through "bounty programs." Avoid projects without clear use cases or those that don't explain why they need their own cryptocurrency instead of using existing ones.

> "Scamcoins is the umbrella term that has been given to any altcoin that was created for no other reason than to profit the creators."

**Quick Take**: If an ICO seems too good to be true, it probably is. Legitimate projects focus on solving problems, not just making quick money for founders.

### The HODL Mindset
The crypto mantra "HODL" (Hold On For Dear Life) originated from a drunk trader's typo but now represents the strategy of holding through volatility. When your ICO investment launches successfully and prices surge, you face a critical decision: take profits or hold for potential greater gains. Consider your debt situation, the project's roadmap, and overall market conditions before deciding.

> "When it comes to investing in ICOs, the current wisdom often takes its cues from the cryptocurrency motto HODL. Short for hold on for dear life, the reverse acronym HODL first came into being in 2013 when an inebriated bitcoin owner posted on a message board."

**Quick Take**: Pay off high-interest debt first, then consider reinvesting profits through compounding—small advantages compound exponentially over time.

## Best Quotes

- "The opportunity to invest in Bitcoin while it was under the $100 mark may have passed you by, there are plenty of new cryptocurrencies on the horizon just waiting to take the world by storm, bringing profits to its early adopters in the process."

- "Dogecoin is different to many other cryptocurrencies in that it has a very rapid production schedule. While it was designed as a joke, which explains the logo, it rapidly developed an impressive following and a market capitalization of greater than $60 million."

- "While the idea here is that getting in early will practically ensure a profit of some sort as the price of the coin has nowhere to go but up, it is important to keep in mind that this is far from a sure thing."

- "Investing in established cryptocurrencies is a risky proposition, and thus investing in ICOs is even riskier."

- "If you go into ICO investment with the expectation that you will be able to retire from your first ICO, then not only will you be disappointed, you will likely make mistakes based around your misestimation of the market as well."
