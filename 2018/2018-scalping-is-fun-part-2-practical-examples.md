**Authors**: Heikin Ashi Trader | **Year**: 2018

## Summary
This book is the second installment in a comprehensive series on scalping techniques using Heikin Ashi charts. It builds upon the foundational setup introduced in Book 1 by integrating technical analysis patterns and practical trading examples. The author, with over 14 years of scalping experience, demonstrates how to combine basic scalping setups with established technical analysis principles to improve entry and exit precision. The book provides real-world trading examples across various markets including forex pairs (EUR/USD, GBP/JPY, USD/JPY) and indices (DAX), showing how to identify trend reversals, manage positions, and adapt to different market conditions.

This guide is perfect for intermediate traders who understand basic scalping concepts but want to enhance their precision by incorporating technical analysis. Readers will learn practical strategies for identifying optimal entry points using doji and spinning top patterns, managing risk-reward ratios, and adapting to both trending and range-bound markets. The book's strength lies in its detailed walkthrough of actual trading sessions, showing both profitable trades and losses to maintain realism.

## Core Insights

### Understanding Heikin Ashi Charts
Heikin Ashi charts are superior to traditional candlestick charts for identifying trends at a glance. The color-coded candles immediately show market direction—red for downtrends, green for uptrends. As a countertrend scalper, you become a specialist in identifying trends that are ending. Candle size is crucial: large candles with long shadows indicate strong momentum and trends in full development, making them poor candidates for countertrend trades. The optimal entry points occur when candles become smaller and doji or spinning top patterns appear, signaling momentum exhaustion and potential trend reversals.

### Entry Signals: Reading Market Momentum
The core entry strategy relies on identifying momentum exhaustion through specific candle patterns. When either a doji (cross-like candle with minimal body) or spinning top (small body with long wicks) appears after a strong trend, it signals that the current momentum is temporarily over. This creates an opportunity for countertrend entry. The key principle is that trading is a probability game—you don't need to predict with 100% certainty whether it's a temporary pause or major reversal. After a doji completes during an uptrend, enter short on the next red candle; after a doji in a downtrend, enter long on the next green candle.

### Exit Management: Following the Flow
Exit signals are straightforward: stay in the trade until Heikin Ashi candles change color. If you're short and the market keeps producing red candles, stay in the position and maximize profits. The correction you're trading follows the same laws as the previous trend—it can develop its own momentum. However, be alert when candles become smaller or new doji/spinning tops appear, as this usually signals the correction is ending. Successful scalpers must eliminate "hope" from their vocabulary and consistently take profits when the chart clearly shows the correction is over.

### Technical Analysis Integration
Technical analysis significantly enhances Heikin Ashi scalping when used properly. Key technical levels include support and resistance zones, previous day's swing highs and lows, and round numbers in forex markets. These levels often coincide with reversal patterns, providing higher-probability entry opportunities. For instance, when the market tests a previous day's swing low and forms a doji, it creates an excellent buying opportunity with tight stop-loss placement. Similarly, failed breakouts at round numbers often lead to sharp reversals that can be scalped efficiently.

### Market Structure Awareness
Understanding market context is crucial for success. Markets trend only about 30% of the time, spending 70% in range-bound conditions where countertrend scalping excels. However, on trend days (typically 1-2 per week), trying to trade against the main trend can be extremely costly. Identify trend days early: if the market immediately reverses your countertrend trade and resumes the main trend, become cautious. Trend days often coincide with major economic data releases and central bank announcements. During such periods, either respect the main trend or use smaller position sizes with wider stops for countertrend attempts.

### Risk Management and Position Sizing
Effective risk management is essential for sustainable scalping. The author demonstrates practical position sizing—starting with smaller positions ($100,000) for the first trade to gauge market conditions, then increasing to 5 lots when confident. Stop-loss placement should be tight (3-5 pips) when entering at clear technical levels, but be prepared to move stops to breakeven quickly when trades move in your favor. The book emphasizes that small losses are simply "costs of business" and must be accepted without hesitation. Each trade should have a logical risk-reward ratio, typically targeting at least 1:1, though the author shows how to adapt this based on market conditions and momentum.

## Questions to Consider

- Are you treating small losses as business costs or letting them affect your trading psychology?
- Do you have the discipline to exit positions immediately when Heikin Ashi candles signal momentum change?
- Are you aware of the larger market context (daily/weekly trends) before taking countertrend positions?
- Can you recognize when markets are in range-bound conditions versus trending environments?
- Do you adjust your position sizing based on market volatility and your confidence level?
- Are you consistently using the most appropriate timeframe for current market conditions?

## Conclusion
This practical guide offers invaluable insights for traders looking to refine their scalping techniques through the integration of Heikin Ashi charts and technical analysis. The author's 14+ years of experience shines through in the realistic trading examples that show both winning and losing trades. The book's greatest strength is its emphasis on practical application over theoretical concepts, with detailed walkthroughs of actual trading sessions across different markets.

The biggest reason to read this book is the author's systematic approach to combining candlestick patterns with technical levels for high-probability setups. The strategies are particularly valuable for traders who struggle with timing their entries and exits or who want to add more structure to their scalping decisions. While the techniques require practice to master, the book provides enough detail and examples for dedicated traders to implement these strategies effectively.

The book's limitations include its focus primarily on forex and index markets, which may require adaptation for other instruments. Additionally, the author postpones detailed money management discussion to Book 3, leaving some questions about position sizing and risk management unanswered. Despite these gaps, this is an essential read for serious scalpers who want to move beyond basic setups and incorporate more sophisticated technical analysis into their trading arsenal.
