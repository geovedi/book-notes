# 21 Lessons for the 21st Century
Yuval Noah Harari

***

The book explores the challenges humanity faces in the 21st century, focusing on the technological and political challenges. The end of history, where liberal ideals dominated, has been postponed due to disillusionment with the liberal story, exacerbated by technological disruptions like AI and biotech. Populist movements, Brexit, and Trump's rise reflect fears of irrelevance and nationalism. Traditional economic growth models are challenged by ecological collapse and automation.

The rise of AI and automation might lead to mass unemployment and create a new useless class. The job market in 2050 might involve more human-AI cooperation. To cope with potential unemployment, new social and economic models like universal basic income (UBI) could be explored.

AI's integration into decision-making raises questions about individual freedom and the shift of authority from humans to algorithms. The ownership of data is crucial to prevent wealth and power concentration. Social media and data-giants manipulate users' attention for profit.

The political challenge involves the breakdown of old stories, rise of nationalism, and the need for global cooperation. Major powers need to prevent nuclear wars and address global challenges like climate change. The traditional education system should adapt to teach critical thinking and adaptability.

Humans rarely think individually; we think in groups, and groupthink shapes beliefs. Fictions and myths shape our understanding of reality. The notion of a "post-truth era" is not new, as misinformation has always existed. Science fiction plays a role in shaping our perceptions of the future.

The search for meaning should involve self-discovery, understanding one's operating system, and recognizing that reality is continuously changing. Rituals and sacrifice play significant roles in shaping group identities. Understanding the constructed nature of the self and the limitations of free will can lead to authenticity.

Meditation offers a tool to observe the mind directly. Researchers should practice meditation themselves to gain insights into consciousness and reality. Understanding our minds is crucial before algorithms start making decisions for us.

## The Technological Challenge

In the 21st century, the notion of an end to history has been deferred as disillusionment with the liberal narrative has grown. Humans have a natural inclination to think in stories rather than facts, numbers, or equations. Throughout the 20th century, three grand stories shaped the world: fascism, communism, and liberalism. The liberal story celebrates liberty and progress through political and economic liberalization. However, since the global financial crisis of 2008, disillusionment with liberalism has increased, compounded by technological disruptions like AI and biotech.

The rise of populist movements, exemplified by Brexit and the ascent of Trump, reflects a fear of irrelevance and a desire to protect national interests. While the liberal story has faced crises before and emerged stronger by adapting and expanding empathy and welfare, the current crisis lacks a coherent ideological opponent, making it more nihilistic in nature. As a result, some countries turn to nationalist and religious narratives as a response to the breakdown of the liberal story.

Technological advancements in infotech and biotech present significant challenges to humanity. AI and automation, for instance, could lead to massive unemployment and the creation of a new useless class in society. AI's capabilities, such as understanding human emotions and intuition about other people, raise questions about the shift in authority from humans to algorithms.

The integration of biotech and infotech could expose the idea of free will as a myth, potentially leading to a shift of authority from humans to computers. Biometric sensors and Big Data algorithms have the potential to revolutionize medicine, while algorithms might become more involved in decision-making in various aspects of life. Ethical dilemmas arise as AI becomes more involved in fields like self-driving cars and military applications, raising concerns about human biases, killer robots, and total surveillance regimes.

The ownership of data becomes critical in preventing the concentration of wealth and power in the hands of a small elite, as data giants accumulate vast amounts of user information. The business model of "attention merchants" and the evaluation of apps, products, and companies based on data reveal the power of data in the digital era. The integration of humans and machines poses ethical and societal challenges, especially concerning sensitive information like DNA and brain data. The regulation of data ownership becomes a crucial factor in shaping the future sociopolitical system.

The erosion of faith in the liberal story, partly due to challenges posed by biotech and infotech revolutions, necessitates collective efforts and technological solutions to address global inequality and social tensions. As humanity faces the bewildering possibilities of the future, it is essential to find new social and political models that can navigate the complex landscape created by technological advancements.

## The Political Challenge

In response to the political upheaval of the 2016 US elections, Mark Zuckerberg, the CEO of Facebook, published a manifesto emphasizing the need to build a global community and rebuild human connections through the platform. Facebook's goal is to use artificial intelligence (AI) to suggest and create meaningful communities, aiming to help one billion people join these communities. Zuckerberg's vision is timely as the breakdown of intimate human communities has contributed to social and political disruptions. However, achieving the vision requires bridging the gap between online and offline communities and strengthening physical connections to ground users in their bodies.

Zuckerberg's call for connecting people based on common interests and experiences may face challenges due to the limitations of online relationships. The "clash of civilizations" thesis, proposing inherent conflicts between Western and Islamic civilizations, is considered misleading. Human groups are fundamentally different from animal species, and historical conflicts cannot be compared to natural selection processes. Over time, human groups tend to coalesce and merge, contributing to the formation of a single global civilization.

War can generate strong bonds between enemies and significantly impact the spread of ideas, technologies, and people. The process of human unification involves establishing links between distinct groups and homogenizing practices across them. Globalization experienced a decline during world wars and the Cold War but rebounded after 1989 in both economic and military aspects. In the early 21st century, there is a single political paradigm accepted worldwide, with around 200 sovereign states agreeing on common diplomatic protocols and international laws.

Recent nuclear arms race developments threaten the gains of peace achieved through international cooperation since 1945. The importance of the European Union in preserving peace in Europe is often overlooked in the Brexit debate. Abandoning the internationalist regime and reverting to nationalist power politics would be risky and irresponsible in the nuclear age, as the survival of humanity depends on prioritizing prevention of nuclear war over national interests.

Ecological collapse caused by human activities disrupting the global biosphere is an existential threat, and climate change requires urgent action to avoid irreversible consequences. Nationalist isolationism is dangerous in the face of climate change, as it necessitates global cooperation to address the issue effectively. Technological disruption is another existential threat that nationalism alone cannot effectively handle.

While traditional religions may not be directly relevant to technical and policy problems, they play a crucial role in shaping group identities and creating divisions between different communities. Religion can be used as a tool for nationalism and maintaining unique national identities. The European Union's multicultural experiment faces challenges due to immigration and assimilation debates, with four key areas of contention: whether to allow immigrants in, the level of assimilation required, the timeline for citizenship, and the definition of national identity.

The debate on immigration involves various perspectives, from anti-immigrationists claiming that immigrants don't assimilate to cultural relativists celebrating diversity. Finding a middle ground for immigration in Europe is crucial for resolving global cultural conflicts and ensuring unity in the face of global challenges. Downplaying hysteria surrounding terrorism could help improve integration and keep borders and minds open, fostering a more inclusive and cooperative society.

## Despair and Hope

Terrorism is a military strategy aimed at spreading fear rather than causing significant material damage. Despite causing relatively few casualties, terrorists can inspire fear on a global scale and provoke overreactions from governments. Their objective is to provoke the enemy to misuse its strength and create a violent political storm. Successful counter-terrorism requires clandestine actions against terror networks, media perspective management, and addressing individual imagination.

Future nuclear, cyber, or bioterrorism would pose a more serious threat and demand drastic reactions from governments. However, in the modern era, major powers have seen a decline in the appeal and success of wars. Countries like the US, China, and Iran have gained their status without significant military conquests. While Russia's conquest of Crimea was a unique success, it didn't translate into similar victories in other parts of Ukraine. Additionally, Russia's wars in the Caucasus and Ukraine were not economically successful and increased distrust and animosity towards Russia.

The nature of the economy has changed, making conquering knowledge through war impractical, and modern warfare can be high-damage, low-profit. Major powers are now more cautious about launching wars due to the risks associated with nuclear weapons and cyberwarfare. History has shown that human stupidity can lead to self-destructive activities, as seen in historical wars that proved counterproductive.

The impact of Judaism on world history is a topic of debate. Israel's educational system is criticized for fostering an exaggerated sense of the importance of Judaism. Morality has deep evolutionary roots, predating religious and cultural influences. While the Hebrew Old Testament gained influence through incorporation into Christianity, morality and ethical codes existed among social mammals long before the appearance of Homo sapiens.

Judaism had a limited impact on world history compared to universal religions like Christianity and Islam. The idea of Judaism being the sole source of global ethical rules is baseless and ignores other important ethical traditions. Many other cultures and civilizations had ethical codes and moral principles prior to Judaism.

Secularism allows for multiple hybrid identities, where individuals can adhere to a religious belief while following the secular ethical code. The secular ideal emphasizes commitment to truth based on evidence, compassion, empathy, freedom, doubt, and courage to admit ignorance. Secular education teaches critical thinking, compassion, and responsibility for one's actions.

Secularism is not exempt from dogmatism or harmful consequences, but it offers a framework for embracing uncertainty and admitting mistakes. Trust should be placed in those who admit ignorance rather than claim infallibility. Overall, secular ethics share common values with various religions and atheists, promoting a compassionate and responsible approach to decision-making and behavior.

## Truth

Human ignorance is more extensive than commonly recognized, and our trust in the rational individual is often misguided. Rather than thinking independently, humans tend to think in groups, and our ability to collaborate in large groups sets us apart from other animals. This can lead to the "knowledge illusion," where we believe we know more than we do, relying on others' knowledge as if it were our own. Simply bombarding people with facts and information is unlikely to change their beliefs, as most of our views are shaped by communal groupthink rather than individual rationality. Groupthink's power is pervasive, affecting ordinary voters, leaders, and even scientists.

Great power can distort the truth, and leaders often find themselves caught between the need to stay in power and understanding complex issues. Our sense of justice, evolved for small-scale societies, struggles to cope with the complexities of the modern global world. When faced with large-scale moral dilemmas, people tend to downsize issues, focus on personal stories, weave conspiracy theories, or adopt dogmas to simplify complex problems. The complexity of the modern world makes it difficult to act morally when we can't know all the relevant facts, leading to complicity in systemic biases and injustices.

The concept of a "post-truth era" is not new, as propaganda and disinformation have existed throughout history. Fictions, such as religions and ideologies, have been powerful tools in shaping human societies and inspiring cooperation. However, fictions can also be harmful, leading to violence and persecution. Humans have the unique ability to know and not to know simultaneously, blurring the line between reality and fiction. To avoid brainwashing and distinguish reality from fiction, it is essential to invest in reliable information and engage with scientific literature.

Science fiction plays a crucial role in shaping people's understanding of technological, social, and economic developments. However, it should be more responsible in depicting scientific realities and focus on real challenges, such as the concentration of power in the hands of a superhuman elite. While some science fiction may be allegorical and reflect deeper societal concerns, it may not always present realistic predictions of the future. It has explored the dangers of technology used for manipulation and control, but it often stops short of fully exploring the implications of its scenarios.

The movie "The Matrix" suggests that escaping the matrix or external world won't make a significant difference, as everything one experiences is within their own body and mind. The mind is not a subject that freely shapes actions and realities but is shaped by history and biology. Media, such as movies, novels, and poems, have a significant influence on shaping our ideas and experiences of emotions like love. For example, the film "Inside Out" deconstructs the idea of an authentic self and free choices, presenting the brain as a collection of conflicting biochemical mechanisms.

Aldous Huxley's "Brave New World" envisions a future society controlled through pleasure and happiness, manipulating human behavior through biotechnology and social engineering. The book raises questions about whether happiness and comfort should override experiencing emotions, suffering, and the uncertainties of life. It reminds us to contemplate the ethical implications of prioritizing pleasure and the potential loss of our authentic human experience.

## Resilience

The world is currently undergoing unprecedented revolutions, leaving old stories crumbling without new ones emerging to take their place. The rapid pace of technological advancements and societal changes makes it challenging to prepare for a future filled with radical uncertainties. As technology enables the engineering of bodies, brains, and minds, predicting the future accurately becomes even more difficult. Consequently, many traditional skills taught in schools may become irrelevant in the future.

Education should shift its focus from mere information retention to teaching critical thinking, communication, collaboration, creativity, and general life skills. The ability to deal with change and reinvent oneself will be essential in the face of the unknown. The modern educational system needs to adapt to the realities of the 21st century, emphasizing self-discovery and mental flexibility.

In a world increasingly influenced by technology, people should be cautious about becoming controlled or manipulated by algorithms. It is essential to strive to understand oneself better than any algorithm could. The search for meaning in life often leads to a desire for a cohesive narrative or story. However, traditional stories may not be adequate for a rapidly changing world.

Different cultural and ideological narratives have been used to define identity and purpose in life, but they may not be universally applicable. Instead, the search for meaning should involve self-discovery and recognizing that reality is continually changing. It is crucial to understand that all stories are incomplete but provide meaning by embedding individuals within something larger than themselves.

Rituals play a significant role in making abstract stories feel real and convincing people to believe in them. One such example is the day of Ashura for Shiite Muslims, which holds great significance, commemorating the martyrdom of Husayn ibn Ali in Karbala. Sacrifice is a potent ritual that makes people more committed to a belief or cause, regardless of its actual truth.

The concept of self, often portrayed through social media, is a fictional story constructed by the mind. Understanding the constructed nature of the self and the limitations of free will can lead to a more authentic understanding of oneself and the world. To achieve this, meditation can be a valuable tool, allowing for the direct observation of the mind and its patterns.

Studying the mind through meditation differs from brain research, which primarily deals with biochemical and electrical activities. Researchers studying meditation could benefit from practicing it themselves, as direct observation can offer important insights about the mind. However, training the mind to observe itself systematically and objectively requires discipline and effort.

Understanding our own minds becomes crucial before algorithms take on decision-making roles for us. Like anthropologists, zoologists, and astronauts invest time and effort to understand different cultures, species, and planets, researchers should embrace a similar approach to explore the depths of the mind. Pills that offer focus may not be ideal for this purpose, as they could hinder a comprehensive understanding.
